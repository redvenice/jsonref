[{"url":null,"title":"Whats special Special Ones 600 000 hotel suite","story":"    Jose Mourinho was driven away from his accommodation at The Lowry after leaving his job as Manchester United\u0027s manager on December 18. The suite next occupant\u0027s was the Mail\u0027s own Robert HardmanDavid Cameron was still in Downing Street and the England football team were revving up for another dismal performance at the European championships when Jose Mourinho first checked in to this gaudily opulent suite in Manchester’s Lowry Hotel.This week, 895 days later, ‘the Special One’ — as he likes to call himself — has finally checked out. Having been summarily dumped as manager of Manchester United Football Club, the mercurial 55-year-old has now vacated the Lowry’s Riverside Suite and a new occupant has moved in: me.I have not even unpacked before I start to wonder why anyone would want to live in a place like this for a month, let alone two-and-a-half years. It might be five-star luxury of the shiniest, blingiest sort — and we all know how that appeals to the footballing fraternity — but there are only so many plumped-up cushions, room-service breakfasts, spa treatments and fluffy bathrobes that a man can endure.As one of football’s grandest grandees, Mourinho will have been offered the finest hacienda-style villas and mock-Georgian piles that Cheshire’s leafy footballer belt has to offer. He could have had his own swimming pool, solarium, snooker room and cinema in the depths of Hale or Alderley Edge.And yet he chose to leave his family behind in their London home and lead a pampered but solitary, soulless existence amid the eternal building site that is city centre Salford. It is hardly private. And it was anything but cheap.           I have not even unpacked before I start to wonder why anyone would want to live in a place like this for a month, let alone two-and-a-half years... There are only so many plumped-up cushions, room-service breakfasts, spa treatments and fluffy bathrobes that a man can endure We can but wonder at the size of Mourinho’s bill, which has been calculated at somewhere between £500,000 and £800,000, depending on the Lowry’s fluctuating room rates. If he was getting the same online deal as me, he would have clocked up a bill of £618,445. And that’s just for the room.At £22.50 on top for breakfast (amazingly, it is not included in the price), £75 for a bottle of Mourinho’s favourite Tuscan wine and even £2.95 for a mini-pack of Pringles from the kitchen-sized minibar, it’s safe to say that his extras will have added a further £100,000 or so to the tab.It will have been even higher if the well-groomed Portuguese smoothie was a regular at the hotel spa (where a ‘High Performance Skin Energiser For Men’ will set you back £70 a time).          The lounge area of the suite in the Lowry Hotel where Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho lived for two yearsAfter two-and-a-half years in charge of Britain’s most famous football club, Mourinho is now jobless and back at the family home in Belgravia.Things, though, are not so very different here at the Lowry since no sooner had he checked out on Tuesday than his replacement, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, checked in on Wednesday. Following his sudden appointment as manager, the 45-year-old Norwegian abandoned his job as the manager of tiny Molde, with its 11,000-seat stadium half-way between Oslo and the Arctic Circle, and flew by private jet to Manchester to take charge at 75,000-seat Old Trafford.He may have replaced the Special One in the United dugout, but he will not be taking over his bed.The hotel management, understandably, refuse to discuss their guests but I learn that Solskjaer has asked for a different Riverside Suite (there are six identical ones). Footballers can be very superstitious and who can blame the new man for not wanting the same room as his predecessor? Besides, the Norwegian cannot have the sixth-floor penthouse Riverside Suite, where Mourinho is reported to have stayed, for the simple reason that, tonight, I am in residence.          There is a pristine kitchen with espresso machine, every sort of tea and a microwave — not that anyone staying in here is likely to want to heat up a ready-meal when 24-hour room service is but a call away (£15.50 for a burger)So, what did Mourinho get for his £691-a-night? I have a panoramic view of the thin, Bovril-black River Irwell through the floor-to-ceiling windows which run the full length of my two huge interconnecting rooms — 735 square feet overall.Whether I am wallowing in my giant L-shaped scarlet sofa in the dining-cum-conference room or lying in the king-sized bed next door, I can watch one of two hefty flatscreen televisions. Or stare out at the Manchester skyline or simply admire myself in the vast mirrored double doors which connect the two rooms. I wonder which the Special One enjoyed doing most.There is a pristine kitchen with espresso machine, every sort of tea and a microwave — not that anyone staying in here is likely to want to heat up a ready-meal when 24-hour room service is but a call away (£15.50 for a burger).          The spacious suite has a bedroom, lounge area, kitchen and walk-in wardrobes but these doors wouldn\u0027t close properlyThere are two walk-in wardrobes large enough for the most incurable shopaholic, a bathroom and shower, plus an additional guest loo. You certainly can’t fault the generosity of the chambermaids. There are dozens of little pots of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and so on. If Mourinho decided to tip this lot in to his luggage on a daily basis, the family would never buy another bar of soap.The five-star Lowry was welcomed as the shiny centrepiece of a grand Mancunian revival when it opened 17 years ago, just in time for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.These days, however, there are signs of wear and tear. During my stay, the DVD player doesn’t work (maybe the Special One threw the remote control at the wall watching replays of last week’s defeat against Liverpool). The telephone in the diningconference room is broken and the kitchen fridge is on the blink, too. My half bottle of Perrier-Jouet (£35 on the bill should I pop the cork) sits in a cold-ish puddle of water.    Whether I am wallowing in my giant L-shaped scarlet sofa in the dining-cum-conference room or lying in the king-sized bed next door, I can watch one of two hefty flatscreen televisions          The two ends of the suite are illustrated by fiery, volcanic impressions of the Calder Valley by Oldham-born artist, Alan Rankle. It is all very contemporary and very striking, though after more than two years of waking up to this stuff, one might yearn for something a little more homelyLying in bed, my eye is caught by old strips of black gaffer tape stuck to the curtain pelmet and the grand double doors to the bedroom won’t shut properly.I can’t open the windows even an inch, so have to rely on a rumbling air conditioning unit. Still, at least I’m spared a chocolate on the pillow.The decor might be described as a modernist Man Utd homage — lots of red and white with strips of black here and there. Only the Christmas tree breaks the colour code.A huge illustrated encyclopaedia called The Big Book Of Chic sits on a coffee table to reassure me that this is all in the best possible taste. The only magazines in here are Tatler and World Of Interiors (nothing about football). The two ends of the suite are illustrated by fiery, volcanic impressions of the Calder Valley by Oldham-born artist, Alan Rankle. It is all very contemporary and very striking, though after more than two years of waking up to this stuff, one might yearn for something a little more homely.          The Portuguese manager had the use of a private dining room at The Lowry during his 30-month stay in the Manchester hotel          Since I am living the Mourinho dream, I want the Special One’s speciality. It’s an elegant, oaky red which goes well with one of his preferred steak dishes  The 42oz ‘Tomahawk’ steak from Cheshire costs £85 for two to share and is served on a wooden board with three sauces          The menu in the Lowry\u0027s dining room includes an £18 starter of Wagyu beef and an 8oz fillet steak - yours for £36          Apparently, Mourinho was particularly partial to the duck pancakes and big, shared beef dishes, along with full-bodied wines like the 2013 Castello Vicchiomaggio Ripa delle More Toscana at £75 a bottle.I can’t imagine what Salford’s most famous son, Laurence Stephen Lowry, would have made of this bling-filled palace bearing his name. Quite apart from the fact that he was a lifelong fan of United’s arch-rivals, Manchester City, he was famous for his gritty scenes of working-class life either side of the war and for his ‘matchstick’ figures massed outside factories and football grounds.The only matchstick figures around here are likely to be those pushing a manicured lettuce leaf around a plate down in the chi-chi first-floor River Restaurant. Not that Mourinho was much of a salad man. Apparently, he was particularly partial to the duck pancakes and big, shared beef dishes, along with full-bodied wines like the 2013 Castello Vicchiomaggio Ripa delle More Toscana at £75 a bottle.Since I am living the Mourinho dream, I want the Special One’s speciality. It’s an elegant, oaky red which goes well with one of his preferred steak dishes, a 42oz ‘Tomahawk’ from Cheshire (£85 for two — with three sauces).Among the local in-crowd whom I talk to, everyone seems to have spotted Mourinho coming in here at some point, usually with a small group of football folk. As one of the most famous faces in this football-mad city, he would find it more congenial to eat in the private dining room off to one side. At least there he could chew his Tomahawk without being stared at.    Black gaffer tape along the curtain rail, a leaky fridge and a broken DVD player took the edge off the luxurious experienceAll of which raises the question of why he chose to live in this very expensive goldfish bowl in the first place. Other players and managers have traditionally based themselves in leafy Cheshire. If Solskjaer takes on the job permanently (he is currently a ‘caretaker’ manager) he will doubtless do the same. As I check out, I bump into a Norwegian television crew checking in. Different goldfish, same bowl.The Lowry staff, all extremely smart and pleasant, are far too discreet to discuss their longest-lasting resident, beyond saying he will be ‘missed’.Mourinho always has enjoyed breaking the mould. I trust they haven’t charged him for breaking the DVD player."},{"url":null,"title":"Alba albino orangutan returned jungle Indonesia","story":"This is the moment Alba the albino orangutan is released by a conservationist of the Borneo Orangutan Survival foundation inside Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia  The stark white fur of the albino orangutan is a stunning sight as she returns to the wilds of Borneo and swings from the treesAlba climbed trees, foraged for food and began building a nest after being released back into the jungle.She was rescued in April last year and was rehabilitated alongside another orangutan called Kika who was released with her. Orangutan pins down cheeky macaque monkey that tried to...‘Sleep tight big fella’: Magician pays tribute to orangutan...Share this articleThe apes were freed inside Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park after a more than 24-hour journey from their rehabilitation center by vehicle, boat and hiking.The foundation originally planned to create a 5-hectare (12-acre) \u0027forest island\u0027 for Alba rather than a release into truly natural habitat because of health issues related to her albinism including poor sight and hearing and the possibility of skin cancer.

The suite next occupant\u0027s was the Mail\u0027s own Robert HardmanDavid Cameron was still in Downing Street and the England football team were revving up for another dismal performance at the European championships when Jose Mourinho first checked in to this gaudily opulent suite in Manchester’s Lowry Hotel.This week, 895 days later, ‘the Special One’ — as he likes to call himself — has finally checked out. Having been summarily dumped as manager of Manchester United Football Club, the mercurial 55-year-old has now vacated the Lowry’s Riverside Suite and a new occupant has moved in: me.I have not even unpacked before I start to wonder why anyone would want to live in a place like this for a month, let alone two-and-a-half years. It might be five-star luxury of the shiniest, blingiest sort — and we all know how that appeals to the footballing fraternity — but there are only so many plumped-up cushions, room-service breakfasts, spa treatments and fluffy bathrobes that a man can endure.As one of football’s grandest grandees, Mourinho will have been offered the finest hacienda-style villas and mock-Georgian piles that Cheshire’s leafy footballer belt has to offer. He could have had his own swimming pool, solarium, snooker room and cinema in the depths of Hale or Alderley Edge.And yet he chose to leave his family behind in their London home and lead a pampered but solitary, soulless existence amid the eternal building site that is city centre Salford. It is hardly private. And it was anything but cheap.           I have not even unpacked before I start to wonder why anyone would want to live in a place like this for a month, let alone two-and-a-half years... There are only so many plumped-up cushions, room-service breakfasts, spa treatments and fluffy bathrobes that a man can endure We can but wonder at the size of Mourinho’s bill, which has been calculated at somewhere between £500,000 and £800,000, depending on the Lowry’s fluctuating room rates. If he was getting the same online deal as me, he would have clocked up a bill of £618,445. And that’s just for the room.At £22.50 on top for breakfast (amazingly, it is not included in the price), £75 for a bottle of Mourinho’s favourite Tuscan wine and even £2.95 for a mini-pack of Pringles from the kitchen-sized minibar, it’s safe to say that his extras will have added a further £100,000 or so to the tab.It will have been even higher if the well-groomed Portuguese smoothie was a regular at the hotel spa (where a ‘High Performance Skin Energiser For Men’ will set you back £70 a time).          The lounge area of the suite in the Lowry Hotel where Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho lived for two yearsAfter two-and-a-half years in charge of Britain’s most famous football club, Mourinho is now jobless and back at the family home in Belgravia.Things, though, are not so very different here at the Lowry since no sooner had he checked out on Tuesday than his replacement, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, checked in on Wednesday. Following his sudden appointment as manager, the 45-year-old Norwegian abandoned his job as the manager of tiny Molde, with its 11,000-seat stadium half-way between Oslo and the Arctic Circle, and flew by private jet to Manchester to take charge at 75,000-seat Old Trafford.He may have replaced the Special One in the United dugout, but he will not be taking over his bed.The hotel management, understandably, refuse to discuss their guests but I learn that Solskjaer has asked for a different Riverside Suite (there are six identical ones). Footballers can be very superstitious and who can blame the new man for not wanting the same room as his predecessor? Besides, the Norwegian cannot have the sixth-floor penthouse Riverside Suite, where Mourinho is reported to have stayed, for the simple reason that, tonight, I am in residence.          There is a pristine kitchen with espresso machine, every sort of tea and a microwave — not that anyone staying in here is likely to want to heat up a ready-meal when 24-hour room service is but a call away (£15.50 for a burger)So, what did Mourinho get for his £691-a-night? I have a panoramic view of the thin, Bovril-black River Irwell through the floor-to-ceiling windows which run the full length of my two huge interconnecting rooms — 735 square feet overall.Whether I am wallowing in my giant L-shaped scarlet sofa in the dining-cum-conference room or lying in the king-sized bed next door, I can watch one of two hefty flatscreen televisions. Or stare out at the Manchester skyline or simply admire myself in the vast mirrored double doors which connect the two rooms. I wonder which the Special One enjoyed doing most.There is a pristine kitchen with espresso machine, every sort of tea and a microwave — not that anyone staying in here is likely to want to heat up a ready-meal when 24-hour room service is but a call away (£15.50 for a burger).          The spacious suite has a bedroom, lounge area, kitchen and walk-in wardrobes but these doors wouldn\u0027t close properlyThere are two walk-in wardrobes large enough for the most incurable shopaholic, a bathroom and shower, plus an additional guest loo. You certainly can’t fault the generosity of the chambermaids. There are dozens of little pots of shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and so on. If Mourinho decided to tip this lot in to his luggage on a daily basis, the family would never buy another bar of soap.The five-star Lowry was welcomed as the shiny centrepiece of a grand Mancunian revival when it opened 17 years ago, just in time for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.These days, however, there are signs of wear and tear. During my stay, the DVD player doesn’t work (maybe the Special One threw the remote control at the wall watching replays of last week’s defeat against Liverpool). The telephone in the diningconference room is broken and the kitchen fridge is on the blink, too. My half bottle of Perrier-Jouet (£35 on the bill should I pop the cork) sits in a cold-ish puddle of water.    Whether I am wallowing in my giant L-shaped scarlet sofa in the dining-cum-conference room or lying in the king-sized bed next door, I can watch one of two hefty flatscreen televisions          The two ends of the suite are illustrated by fiery, volcanic impressions of the Calder Valley by Oldham-born artist, Alan Rankle. It is all very contemporary and very striking, though after more than two years of waking up to this stuff, one might yearn for something a little more homelyLying in bed, my eye is caught by old strips of black gaffer tape stuck to the curtain pelmet and the grand double doors to the bedroom won’t shut properly.I can’t open the windows even an inch, so have to rely on a rumbling air conditioning unit. Still, at least I’m spared a chocolate on the pillow.The decor might be described as a modernist Man Utd homage — lots of red and white with strips of black here and there. Only the Christmas tree breaks the colour code.A huge illustrated encyclopaedia called The Big Book Of Chic sits on a coffee table to reassure me that this is all in the best possible taste. The only magazines in here are Tatler and World Of Interiors (nothing about football).

The Portuguese manager had the use of a private dining room at The Lowry during his 30-month stay in the Manchester hotel          Since I am living the Mourinho dream, I want the Special One’s speciality. It’s an elegant, oaky red which goes well with one of his preferred steak dishes  The 42oz ‘Tomahawk’ steak from Cheshire costs £85 for two to share and is served on a wooden board with three sauces          The menu in the Lowry\u0027s dining room includes an £18 starter of Wagyu beef and an 8oz fillet steak - yours for £36          Apparently, Mourinho was particularly partial to the duck pancakes and big, shared beef dishes, along with full-bodied wines like the 2013 Castello Vicchiomaggio Ripa delle More Toscana at £75 a bottle.I can’t imagine what Salford’s most famous son, Laurence Stephen Lowry, would have made of this bling-filled palace bearing his name. Quite apart from the fact that he was a lifelong fan of United’s arch-rivals, Manchester City, he was famous for his gritty scenes of working-class life either side of the war and for his ‘matchstick’ figures massed outside factories and football grounds.The only matchstick figures around here are likely to be those pushing a manicured lettuce leaf around a plate down in the chi-chi first-floor River Restaurant. Not that Mourinho was much of a salad man. Apparently, he was particularly partial to the duck pancakes and big, shared beef dishes, along with full-bodied wines like the 2013 Castello Vicchiomaggio Ripa delle More Toscana at £75 a bottle.Since I am living the Mourinho dream, I want the Special One’s speciality. It’s an elegant, oaky red which goes well with one of his preferred steak dishes, a 42oz ‘Tomahawk’ from Cheshire (£85 for two — with three sauces).Among the local in-crowd whom I talk to, everyone seems to have spotted Mourinho coming in here at some point, usually with a small group of football folk. As one of the most famous faces in this football-mad city, he would find it more congenial to eat in the private dining room off to one side. At least there he could chew his Tomahawk without being stared at.    Black gaffer tape along the curtain rail, a leaky fridge and a broken DVD player took the edge off the luxurious experienceAll of which raises the question of why he chose to live in this very expensive goldfish bowl in the first place. Other players and managers have traditionally based themselves in leafy Cheshire. If Solskjaer takes on the job permanently (he is currently a ‘caretaker’ manager) he will doubtless do the same. As I check out, I bump into a Norwegian television crew checking in. Different goldfish, same bowl.The Lowry staff, all extremely smart and pleasant, are far too discreet to discuss their longest-lasting resident, beyond saying he will be ‘missed’.Mourinho always has enjoyed breaking the mould.

The boys all have Greek middle names in honour of their grandfather Elia Stratis who died in Lockerbie Every year the family make the trip, one made particularly poignant on the 30th anniversary by the fact that their eldest son Joshua is now seven, the same age Sonia was when she lost her father.But what makes their visit even more remarkable is that the family are there to remember not just one victim of the Lockerbie bombing, but two.Sonia and her husband Chris were brought together by the disaster. Sonia lost her father, Chris\u0027s stepmother lost her husband. Ten years ago they met at a memorial dinner for families of the victims, fell in love and married. That their joy has come through such shared heartbreak and grief has proved bittersweet for them both. \u0027Two men died in order for Chris and myself to know each other and come together,\u0027 says Sonia.\u0027A few years ago I remember talking to my mother, through many tears, about how she lost her husband in order for me to meet mine. I grieved for her loss in a new way with that realisation. But I am still so thankful for the three full little lives that have come from this loss.\u0027Today, accessories designer Sonia, 37, is a happy, vibrant, stay-at-home mum to three rambunctious young boys: Joshua, seven, Lucian, five, and Giovanni, two. The family live in Williamsburg, Virginia, where Chris works as an executive film producer.           Sonia\u0027s husband Chris was raised with a stepmother and three step-siblings who had been deeply affected by the tragedy: his step-mother\u0027s first husband William Daniels died in the crashChris\u0027s father Russ had married Kathy Daniels, whose husband William had been killed at Lockerbie, when Chris was in his early teens.Raised with a stepmother and three step-siblings who had been deeply affected by the tragedy, Chris understood the grief that comes with losing a loved one in a terrorist attack, and like many of the US victims\u0027 relatives, the two families had become close.Yet until that night, Chris and Sonia had never met. Chris says there was an \u0027instant chemistry\u0027. Sonia says he made her laugh, and that his jokes \u0027made me happy during what was usually a serious time\u0027.\u0027I had known his stepfamily for years. We spent time talking that night along with his stepbrother and another fellow who had lost his father on the flight. After that we started talking on the phone.\u0027Trips between Boston and New York where the two lived followed, and they quickly fell in love.\u0027Chris knew how to deal with my pain over Lockerbie because he had grown up with people affected by it,\u0027 says Sonia.\u0027I felt safe sharing that side of me. I didn\u0027t feel like I was going to be judged. Other people in my life – both friends and boyfriends – have said things like, \u0027Why can\u0027t you get over this?\u0027 A lot of people just don\u0027t know what to say, so they say the wrong things.\u0027The couple were engaged less than 18 months later. Their wedding, in August 2010, coincided with the first anniversary of the release of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi from prison, a decision by the Scottish Government which many of the US victims\u0027 families vehemently disagreed with, including Sonia\u0027s mother, who stated that the relatives \u0027felt betrayed\u0027.None of it marred the couple\u0027s special day, however. Sonia walked down the aisle on her mother\u0027s arm holding a bouquet with her father\u0027s picture, so that he could be with her. \u0027I obviously missed my daddy walking me down the aisle and dancing with me, but my mother and I also have a special bond and we found a way to make it special for us while honouring my father,\u0027 she says.More than two dozen of the victims\u0027 relatives attended the wedding. Even President Barack Obama sent the couple a message of good luck, saying: \u0027Though the pain of your shared loss brought you together, your wedding marks a new beginning and the start of a lifelong partnership.\u0027Their union touched a nerve both with the families of the victims and with many other Americans, still reeling from the 911 attacks less than a decade earlier.\u0027I hope that people have found hope from our story,\u0027 says Sonia. \u0027I know that people we share it with personally have, and I hope that it can bring hope to others too. I love that something I have to share can bring hope to people.\u0027    A picture taken in Lockerbie on December 22, 1988, shows the wreckage of Pan Am flight 103 aircraft that exploded killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. Scottish prosecutors on October 15, 2015 said they had identified two new Libyan suspects in the bombing Sonia says that far from providing conflict, the disaster that brought them together has also brought them closer as a couple.\u0027Coming through a tragedy like this has forever marked our lives and our marriage. Sure, there are the deep scars, but there is also for us a grounding in knowing that good can come out of evil,\u0027 she says.\u0027So no matter how hard something can be in life or marriage, we are grounded in the truth that good can come from bad, life can come from death, hope can come out of hopelessness.\u0027It was something that particularly resonated when her eldest son Joshua turned seven last month. \u0027He is now the age I was when I lost my dad,\u0027 she says.\u0027In a way, it helps me to see myself in a new light. I realise seven is an age when you have a foundation of self and many formed memories, but also so much of life you\u0027ve not experienced yet. I\u0027m so thankful that Joshua has not experienced the loss I did at his age, and in a way he gets to retain a bit more innocence than I did when evil forced its way into my life and took my daddy.\u0027In common with many relatives of the US victims, the Stratis family felt that justice had been done when Megrahi was convicted.In 2015, Sonia\u0027s mother Mary Kay, who is chairman of the board of the US group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, released a strongly worded statement regarding an appeal of the Libyan\u0027s conviction, which is currently being considered by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and is backed by Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter Flora at Lockerbie and has been a vocal supporter of Megrahi.\u0027While it will never really be \u0027over\u0027, she wrote, \u0027it is past time for Dr Swire and the Megrahi supporters to end their disgraceful and expensive campaign.\u0027Sonia is slightly more reticent about the review, which is expected to take several years.\u0027Above all I believe in truth and justice. Do I think that the whole truth has been brought to light? No. I do feel that the evidence presented in court was fairly compelling, but I definitely don\u0027t believe that\u0027s all there is to what happened.\u0027I hope that more can be uncovered and brought to light.\u0027Sonia and her mother have visited Lockerbie several times, and when the boys are older she plans to bring them to Scotland too. \u0027The few times I\u0027ve been, it\u0027s felt like going home in a way,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027d love to share that feeling with my boys.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to show them the beauty that is there, both in the setting, but also in the beautiful, kind, welcoming, comforting people.\u0027At last year\u0027s memorial service at Arlington, watching others lay flowers, Joshua collected some leaves and placed them by the name of the grandfather he never met. Then he found some more and placed them at Bill Daniels\u0027s name.It was a touching tribute from a little boy whose family was created out of unfathomable tragedy – the legacy of which is now bringing hope."},{"url":null,"title":"BAZ BAMIGBOYE Frozen musical transform stage Theatre Royal Drury Lane","story":"    \u0027The theatrical magic — and snowstorms — of the musical Frozen will transform the stage of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane once Andrew Lloyd Webber’s £45 million refurbishment of the Covent Garden jewel is complete\u0027           Caissie Levy as Elsa performs a scene from the musical Frozen in New York this year          \u0027If the creatives get the balance right, my hunch is Frozen could be a bigger hit here than on Broadway\u0027I suspect it may be autumn, given that work on the theatre — which will begin as soon as 42nd Street closes its run in January — is expected to take at least 18 months.Disney Theatrical Productions declined to comment on any aspect of Frozen, which is based on the animated film featuring music and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.

There’s a roaring fire and the place is decorated with quaint, and faintly freaky bric-a-brac (I can see a stuffed cat dressed in a Santa suit).‘I love eccentric London. Eccentric England,’ Patti said happily.She picked the venue, having enjoyed an arvo spread at the Zetter’s sister hotel in Marylebone.Tea isn’t such a big deal in the United States. ‘No, not at all,’ she agreed, before popping a glazed gammon and piccalilli delicacy into her mouth.‘We have breakfast, lunch and dinner. That’s it. How did this happen?!’ she asked as we go on to discuss the rules of taking tea and whether the jam goes on the scone before the cream and how thrilled she’d been, years ago, tasting clotted cream for the first time.‘The jam has to go on first, right? Otherwise you smash the cream?’ she said (she is correct, by the way, in my opinion).The idea for tea with Patti came when Chris Harper, business partner of Company’s celebrated director Marianne Elliott, mentioned in passing that many of the ‘boys’ from Company enjoy popping into the actress’s stage level dressing room.‘What we have are Patti’s Panderings,’ she said...the name given to the gatherings by Richard Fleeshman, who plays Andy, the dim but strapping flight attendant whom Bobbi wants to devour during a number called Barcelona.Patti explained that ‘the guys come into my dressing room between numbers, and at the end of the first act…there’s plenty of room — and their rooms are way up the stairs.’Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it\u0027s Superdog! Grinning...Inuits fear the curse of HMS Terror has been reawakened by...Share this articleShe and her esteemed dresser Murray Lane started feeding them. Apples with almond butter, and other tidbits. Ashley Campbell arrived one day with smoked salmon and cream cheese. George Blagden brought sausage rolls. Sometimes Patti picks up mini pork pies from a posh butcher in Holborn and serves them with chutney. A fruit course might include clementines and strawberries. ‘They’re only little nibbles,’ she said.‘We gossip, and everybody’s listening for the cue to go back on stage. It’s turned into this very sweet, wonderful bonding of the company. In my dressing room.’The Broadway legend said that ‘the guys have banned the women’ — though Mel Giedroyc shows up anyway.‘I don’t know why the women were banned,’ Patti mused. ‘If there’s anything left over, we give it to the girls.’With Christmas approaching ‘we’re going wild now’, she said, adding mince pies to the snacking menu.I told her that, in my opinion, the best are to be found at Maison Bertaux in Soho (I shall be leaving a few at the stage door for them).It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it.‘Usually with musicals I’m like: “When’s it’s going to end?” I’m already mourning the end of this one, because it’s a great experience.’And it’s a great show. I caught up with Company (for about the fourth or fifth time) a couple of days before our tea date, and every performance has deepened: Patti’s and Rosalie’s in particular.The Juilliard School-trained thespian clearly adores her co-star — and the whole of the company of Company — and is torn about repeating the role if the show plays on Broadway. Which I’m certain it will.She said she faced a similar dilemma when she played in the original cast of Les Miserables at the Barbican, where she created the role of Fantine. (She also played Norma Desmond in the original, West End production of Sunset Boulevard.)‘This is my company — I belong to this company,’ she said. ‘I had said that I’d never do another musical on Broadway. But I did this for Marianne, in London. I had no idea it would turn out to be this happy, incredible experience.’But doing it in New York? Starting in a new musical there would be ‘so complicated’. ‘You start your first rehearsal exhausted. You start the run exhausted.’And then there’s the acting...We discuss a revival of a play in New York which we both saw and both struggled to understand.‘I get told off about my diction but at this I was going “What did they say?!” I wanted to shout: “Slow down! Enunciate!!”’And the musical performances haven’t been much better. ‘I go: “Really? Really?! You call that a leading lady? You call that a leading man?” They don’t come across the footlights.’She noted that the great Ethel Merman (whom she never saw, live) could hit the theatre’s back wall without a microphone. A rare occurrence today.‘They’re forgetting how to P R O J E C T,’ she enunciated, with such command that hotel staff 20 yards away leapt to attention.‘Often they’re miscast, just because they had success on TV or something. They’re not successful, because they’re limited — because they don’t come across the footlights.‘I think people forget that they’re doing it for an audience, and that there’s more to it than learning the lines and singing as beautifully as you can.‘You have to want to do it. You have to have the technique to do it. You have to be fearless.’          \u0027It’s clear Patti has been enjoying her time in London. She will remain here until Company closes on March 30. ‘I couldn’t be happier,’ she said, with a cat-that-got-the-clotted-cream kind of smile. ‘Happy on stage, and content in my life. That’s the way I phrase it\u0027She went on to praise Rosalie Craig. ‘She makes me cry because I’ve seen women her age in musicals who have gotten great reviews and even won awards and I’ve gone “Why?”‘But watching Rosalie is different. She’s the essence of what a leading lady in musical theatre should be.’We paused, while she sampled more delights from ‘Aunt Wilhelmina’s’ menu (little sandwiches), and I tackled ‘Uncle Seymour’ (Scotch quail eggs, mini truffled sausage rolls).There were cakes, and two snowman Pavlovas, which we happily donated Jo Davidson, my long-suffering photographer.We could have carried on for hours, but five o’clock was fast approaching and Patti wanted to get to the Gielgud. Her progress to the door was slowed by a group of American actors at the next table, keen to fete her. And who could blame them.Here’s to the sensational lady … who drinks tea.   Ben\u0027s unlikely blonde ambitionSome like it hot, and Ben Whishaw is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe in a new play. Yes, that’s what I said.Whishaw will star in a new work by Anne Carson, the renowned classics professor and poet. ‘It’s called Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy,’ the actor told me. ‘Norma Jeane Baker was Monroe’s real name and the play’s about Marilyn Monroe — and I play her . . . sort of.’He added that the American soprano Renee Fleming will sing in the production, which is being directed by Katie Mitchell at The Shed, a new arts complex opening in Manhattan in the spring.  \u0027Some like it hot, and Ben Whishaw (left) is preparing to walk through the flames to portray Marilyn Monroe (right) in a new play. Yes, that’s what I saidWhishaw is on the big screen at the moment in the delightful Mary Poppins Returns — he plays grown up Michael Banks, with Emily Mortimer as his sister Jane. The magical nanny, deliciously played by Emily Blunt, returns to Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane to help the siblings as much as Michael’s three young children.Whishaw sings in the Poppins film but stressed that he won’t in Norma Jeane Baker Of Troy.‘It’s about as far away from Mary Poppins as you could possibly go,’ he told me.Carson’s piece, partly spoken and partly sung, is based on the Greek tragedy of Helen, the beauty whose face launched a thousand ships. Scholars have tried before to link the allure of Monroe with the Ancient Greeks. Moral philosophy lecturer Dr Edward Spence, for instance, noted Monroe’s comment in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes that ‘when love goes wrong, nothing goes right’, claiming that ‘Plato would agree’.After Marilyn, Whishaw will join his 007 colleagues, as Q, in Bond 25, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga.   Now that\u0027s what I call a super-scary power coupleDirector Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W. Bush’s vice president, in the town of Casper, Wyoming.It’s 1963 and Cheney, then a very unpolished young man, is shown drunk as a skunk.McKay then cuts to a shot of Cheney sitting in the White House Situation Room, where he has taken control of operations after the 911 attacks in 2001. Bush was being flown to a place of safety — which suited Cheney just fine.          Director Adam McKay sets the opening scene of his film Vice, about Dick Cheney, George W.

Amy Adams stars as Lynne Cheney in Vice          \u0027In the film Cheney is seen in 1963 then a very unpolished young man\u0027.Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Adam McKayMcKay’s masterstroke was to cast Christian Bale and Amy Adams as Cheney and his wife Lynne. They are sublime.‘I’ve never seen someone so purely interested in power,’ McKay said of Cheney. Equally, it’s rare that I’ve seen performances, such as the ones Bale and Adams deliver, that embody that sense of power on the screen.McKay said he and Bale spent a lot of time talking about characters who internalise their emotions. ‘They cover themselves up and Christian’s very good at giving life to such people,’ McKay said. Cheney may not have been a great orator but ‘he knew that the real power resides in the ones who are out of the spotlight’.McKay added that while preparing the film he thought of the 1986 movie Sid And Nancy, about Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Both were junkies.‘That was a love story,’ he commented, and this is a love story, too. ‘Lynne Cheney wanted safety, security — and she wanted control. And if Dick was going to be with her, he’s going to get those things. He has to, if he loves her.‘I kept thinking of Sid and Nancy and how one of them had to become what the other wanted, if they wanted to be together,’ he told me when we met at the Soho Hotel. ‘There are people in Casper who to this day claim that no matter who Lynne married, he would have made it to the White House.’You’re drawn in by the Cheneys in Vice — but they scare you half to death too.I’ve long been fascinated by the intricacies of American politics, so Vice was like caviar to me. It received six Golden Globes nominations, so I will watch with interest at the Globes’ ceremony in Beverly Hills on January 6.

Former Argentina president Cristina Kirchner will go on trial for corruption (pictured at the new abortion law in August 2018)The scandal has engulfed practically the entire construction industry in Argentina, even involving Macri\u0027s family.His father Franco and brother Gianfranco were called before Bonadio last week to answer questions relating to the Autopistas del Sol company, a subsidiary of the Macri Group, in connection with alleged bribes paid to secure highway contracts.His cousin and businessman, Angelo Calcaterra has also been caught up in the probe.The president, who held important roles in the family business started by his father before beginning a political career, has not commented on the case, while the government has said it respects the judiciary\u0027s independence.Away from the corruption scandal, Macri has his hands full managing an economic crisis that has seen the peso lose 50 percent of its value against the dollar this year, while Argentina entered recession earlier this week.Macri has secured a £44 billion bailout loan from the International Monetary Fund to try to drag Argentina out of its problems, while implementing tough austerity measures."},{"url":null,"title":"Two home children leap 40ft window ledge blazing apartment","story":"Rescuers (left) encourage the two children to jump from their fourth floor window and try to catch them (right) as they fall towards the awning in Novosibirsk, RussiaLocals also held blankets and put coats and cardboard on the ground to soften their falls.Yulia, a witness, said: \u0027Some people brought blankets and held them, others put boxes underneath hoping to make it softer for the children when they fell.\u0027Some people gave their thick winter coats.

Media reports from last year claimed that the Chinese military was mass-producing the vessels in the Jiangnan Shipyard.             Icebreaker Xue Long 2 prepares to take water in the Jiangnan Shipyard on September 10Matthew Funaiole, a fellow at the China Power Project, said he and his colleagues decided to analyse the Jiangnan Shipyard to find out its importance to the modernisation of the People\u0027s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).Mr Funaiole told MailOnline: \u0027There is a lot of interested in the PLAN\u0027s modernisation, especially with regard to the pace at which China is producing modern, capable warships.\u0027  China\u0027s state-run Xinhua News Agency last month reported that Beijing was building its third aircraft carrier, marking the first official Chinese media confirmation of the warship\u0027s construction.Rumour has it that the warship is being built in the Jiangnan Shipyard. Mr Funaiole said the team also hoped to verify the claims, but they were not able to find any evidence of the construction of an aircraft carrier in the shipyard. China currently has two aircraft carriers: Liaoning, a refitted Soviet ship it bought from Ukraine that went into service in 2012, and Type 001A, the country\u0027s first domestically designed and built carrier.           China\u0027s President Xi Jinping has vowed to build a world-leading naval force for the countryChina\u0027s president Xi Jinping has vowed to build a leading navy since he took the office in 2012. In April, China held its largest-ever naval parade on the South China Sea which involved 48 warships, 76 warplanes and more than 10,000 soldiers, according to Xinhua News Agency.While reviewing the parade, President Xi said the mission for China to build a strong naval force had never been more pressing. Analysis of Jiangnan Shipyard | ChinaPower Project"},{"url":null,"title":"Inside Morocco beheading suspects squalid home Jealous man lived rundown family house","story":"Younes Ouaziad (pictured) is one of four men held over the murders of Dane Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and Norwegian Maren Ueland, 28, in the Atlas Mountains           The obsessive hunter became intensely \u0027jealous\u0027 of his wife (pictured) after he turned to religion, his wife added, forbidding her from leaving the house alone          Images show the dilapidated house of Younes Ouaziad, one of four men held over the murders of Dane Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and Norwegian Maren Ueland, 28, in the Atlas Mountains  Louisa Vesterager Jespersen (left) and her friend Maren Ueland (right) were murdered in Morocco by suspected ISIS terroristsThe illiterate and unemployed father-of-one had recently become religious and was \u0027brainwashed\u0027 by his ISIS handlers, his brother, who refused to be named, said.Ouaziad, arrested on a bus along with three others yesterday, lived at the property along with his wife, daughter, sister and her baby.Speaking at their home, Ouaziad\u0027s family and friends spoke of their shock, painting a picture of a devoted family man who was chronically workshy and vulnerable to radicalisation after he turned to religion.Sick ISIS fanatics and their supporters take to social media...\u0027It\u0027s Allah\u0027s will\u0027: Fanatics branded two Scandinavian women...Share this articleHis father said: \u0027On Sunday night, police came to my house to investigate.

We talked to her about the past 12 months – and she picked out some of her favourite imagesHow would you describe the year from the point of a news photographer?This year has been non-stop but that’s exactly what you want as a news photographer. It keeps you on your toes and pushes you to tell the story in the best possible way.I’ve been lucky enough to be involved in some really interesting stories, including Cambridge Analytica, the Salisbury poisoning, a royal baby, two royal weddings, Donald Trump’s working visit to the UK, the World Cup, the Pope’s visit to Ireland, the migrant caravan in Mexico and, of course, Brexit. Each and every one of them was very different, often challenging but equally as rewarding.What was your favourite assignment?My favourite assignment this year was the World Cup, it was so exciting to be covering a story that had such a global interest, particularly coming from England, where World Cup fever was as big as it was in Russia. Knowing the pictures you’re taking are being seen all over the world is all you want from a story, and the World Cup did exactly that.What is the best image you took or one that touched you – is there a story behind this?My favourite image I took this year was one taken while on my second visit to Mexico covering the migrant caravan. It was the first time in my life I’d seen an actual physical border between two countries. Amazed and fascinated by its existence, I was drawn to spending time at the border fence. It was taken on my first day in Tijuana, I’d been sitting on the beach in front of the fence for about an hour just absorbing my surroundings. It was very busy with locals and tourists enjoying the good weather on the beautiful Mexican beach, so I didn’t expect to witness anything related to the story, but then I spotted a male migrant take his shoes off and he began to climb the fence.It was surreal, I’d travelled over 1,000 km with the caravan as they made their way through Mexico to the US border so that moment and this picture sum up the story for me.Are there any communities that you have made relationships with in your work as a photojournalist?Working with the migrant caravan this year was the most amount of time I’ve spent with any one community as a photojournalist, some of them were wonderful people who were very welcoming. As an outsider looking in, it’s important to build a rapport with people, to be invited into their world because it helps you get the most out of the story.Do you approach stories in a particular way? How do you approach switching between completely different stories and places?The thing I’ve learnt the most about this job is to approach every story with an open mind because you really never know what is going to happen next with it. When people are involved, you just have to let them do their thing and the pictures will follow.One of the best things about this job is the variety that comes with it. Every day is totally different and switching between stories so quickly keeps your mind and your pictures fresh.It’s not unusual to be photographing the prime minister walking out of 10 Downing Street one day and then sat getting wet at Stamford Bridge for a Chelsea game the next, but I wouldn’t want it any other way. I think that says a lot about my attention !Aside from the news-driven material – were there any features in particular that you were most proud of?The feature I shot that I’m most proud of this year is one called: Pride and worry, Britain’s free health service turns 70, the beginning of an ongoing project illustrating life within the NHS. I worked in an NHS hospital while I was studying to become a photographer so it’s something I’d wanted to shoot for quite some time.“I’ve had so many things go wrong with my body in the past four and a half years that it’s just incredible that one organisation can cure so many things and treat me so kindly, efficiently and for free. It’s just astonishing,” said Ritson. He remembers what it was like before the state-funded NHS when healthcare was beyond the reach of many people because they could not afford to pay doctors’ fees.This was the third and final time I was photographing Donald Trump during his working visit to the UK. I’d noticed he had a tendency to hold Theresa May by the hand when they used stairs, so I lay on the floor for 15 minutes waiting for the pair to exit via some steps. As they did, Trump took May by the arm and shouted over his shoulder: “Yes” in response to the question: “Mr President, will you tell Putin to stay out of the US elections?”Rong Lu said she has been coming to the swimming shed for 30 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1954f76649a964829e28b766f86cac6f8959070d/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=793ce0e221185e4bf5685c323ffbbede","title":"elders older wiser brexit clown parliament generation politics","story":"Parliament seems hellbent on frittering away my generation’s future – while destroying young people’s faith in politicsNine months ago I was part of a group of young people who started a political campaign. We wanted our voices to be heard on Brexit. We’ve now built a national movement across campuses, schools, towns and cities.We’ve gone from being laughed at to offering the most credible way forward. And in doing that, we’ve been able to engage directly with some brilliant, principled politicians across all parties. In contrast to how they are usually seen, I have come to believe that most – even some of those with whom I disagree – are in this for the right reasons.But the past few weeks have filled me with a sense of dread about this new and peculiar world we find ourselves in. It is now less than 100 days until Brexit and, as each day passes – with no vote on any deal or parliamentary progress to avert impending crisis – this anxiety increases. The respect I have gained for the political class is in danger of turning to disgust.Our elders are supposed to know better, to be wiser, yet I see no leadership and no plan: nothing for my generation but prolonged posturing. Rather than engage meaningfully, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition appear to have focused their entire energy on political brinkmanship and time-wasting.Theresa May continues to threaten the country with the prospect of a suicidal no-deal Brexit if she cannot force through a plan that even her own cabinet knows is all but dead. Her ministers tweet their support for her in public but manoeuvre behind her back. For every Jo Johnson or Sam Gyimah who resign on principle, dozens more cling to their ministerial limousines.Where we might have hoped for voices of reason, we see remainers such as Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt ingratiating themselves with the ever-shrinking, ever-aging Conservative base by acting like hardcore Brexiters. Both of them now say they are sanguine about a no-deal eventuality, something they vehemently opposed just months ago.Why could this be? Is the Conservative party really only able to elect a future leader who will welcome a catastrophic no-deal with open arms? They can wave goodbye to the support of my generation if they do. Most Tory MPs spent the last week far more animated by internal spats and Brexit fantasies than the grave political crisis we are in. Shamefully, May pulled the vote on the withdrawal agreement, leading to unabated coverage for her party’s European Reform Group ideologues – who declare no confidence in their leader while claiming Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg would be capable of delivering a better Brexit. It is a farce.And at the same time Jeremy Corbyn, who symbolised a bold and different approach to politics to so many young people like me, now seems to be in thrall to the same techniques of triangulation and gamesmanship he once despised in others.Labour says its priority is a general election and will only campaign for a people’s vote if it fails to secure that. But it admits the numbers are not there to succeed with a motion of no confidence and does nothing.There is no Brexit deal from either the right or the left that can deliver the cake-and-eat-it fantasies we were fed in 2016. And there is no deal that is better than the one we already have.Thousands upon thousands of young people are throwing everything they possibly can into their vision for a positive future inside the European Union. We are engaged with politics. But it’s difficult to engage with politicians who care more for their careers than our futures and those of generations to come.• Lara Spirit is co-president of Our Future Our Choice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6fa94a4e72a1b91d10b21cf02c45fb958945eb/0_47_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5fcc253935963662cd8f8edb21f44e5","title":"japan resuming commercial whaling butchers","story":"Humans should be the Earth’s custodians, not its butchersWhales are among the most intelligent beings on Earth. They have what experts define as “culture” they learn knowledge as iniduals and share it with others sperm whales talk with local dialects orcas appear to grieve for their dead offspring – a few months ago, one grieving killer whale carried her dead calf on her back for more than two weeks. They are thinking, caring, complex animals. That Japan is reportedly planning to withdraw from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and resume commercial whaling should, then, horrify us all.The IWC banned commercial whaling three decades ago, but Japan has exploited an exemption to hunt whales for “research” purposes, including killing 122 pregnant whales last winter. The proof for this supposed “research” is desperately lacking. Since the ban, more than 30,000 whales have been killed and before the ban on commercial whaling, Japan and other whaling nations helped drive some species of whales to the brink of extinction. Indeed, in the eight decades before the IWC ban, an estimated 1.3 million whales in the Antarctic alone were killed by commercial whaling. Hunting for blue whales in the Antarctic was banned more than half a century ago, yet the population has never recovered: their numbers worldwide have collapsed from 220,000 to perhaps just 3,000.Humans should be the Earth’s custodians, not its butchers. Much attention – though not enough – focuses on the existential threat posed by climate change. But humanity’s mass destruction of the Earth’s wildlife is all too little discussed. We are witnessing the sixth great mass extinction event, not because of an asteroid colliding with the planet or catastrophic volcanic eruptions, but because of humanity. The passenger pigeon, the golden toad, the Caspian tiger: they are all gone, and other species hang by a thread. Our actions are not merely driving other species to extinction: we threaten our own survival, too, by destabilising ecosystems and destroying bioersity.Japan’s actions should meet universal condemnation. But a renewed assault on whales should be a broader reminder that humanity is at war with its own planet. It may well prove to be a war of annihilation that, without a drastic shift in course, destroys us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0438dcdd6a30d5d202ae851a0b16578e87c19bb/15_0_2969_1782/master/2969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b263d79d79769f197c0d7019bb2d0e0","title":"trademarking hakuna matata disney africa lion king","story":"Heckles and eyebrows are rising at the news that Disney Corporation has trademarked the Swahili tagline “hakuna matata” from the film The Lion King. First popularised in 1982 in the song Jambo Bwana from the Kenyan band Them Mushrooms, then Disneyfied a decade later, the phrase roughly translates to “no worries”. Though Disney applied for the trademark when the movie came out in 1994, a petition was launched asking us to “say no to Disney or any corporationsiniduals looking to trademark languages, terms or phrases they didn’t invent”. It has already received more than 120,000 signatures.And the resistance is coming from Africa itself. Shelton Mpala, who started the petition, told the BBC: “Growing up in Zimbabwe, I always had an understanding that a culture’s language was its richness.” Mpala doesn’t speak Swahili himself – the language is spoken in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But the diaspora has had enough. The post-colonial empire is striking back.There is backlash to the blacklash, of course. This is just PC nonsense, it’s just a song, just an animal movie. But this is precisely the problem with these cultural products: they paint this “Africa” as an imaginary space but nevertheless use broad, stereotypical tropes about the continent (animals and warrior tribes and mangled accents). This inaccuracy is longstanding and pervasive in Hollywood, from Coming to America to Hotel Rwanda. Why is this the tipping point?Disney is too big to ignore, for one thing. But there is a patent absurdity to the idea that hakuna matata would be subject to trademark. It’s like copyrighting “goodbye” or “hang loose”.Disney’s move feels so rampantly greedy, especially given that the corporation is about to capitalise again via a “live action” Lion King remake. Should they ever be allowed to put money or claims of ownership on to cultural products? As my sister texted me: “OMG American corporations and their efforts to own sh*t that’s not even ownable.” She and I – mixed-race Zambian migrants to the US – have been chatting a lot about cultural appropriation lately. We’re torn. We both tend towards cultural mixing, be it in fashion or in literature. Creolisation makes for the best art, and we all know imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But the thing is: money matters and so does power.The film Black Panther has a whole interlude about the appropriation – or rather expropriation – of African cultural products. The anti-hero, Killmonger, stands in a British museum examining a Wakandan pickaxe inside a glass case. It could be a tool or a weapon or a work of art. “How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a full price for it? Or did they take them like they took everything else?” he accosts a curator, then promptly breaks the glass to steal it – or restore it to its rightful owner, that is. This scene has now become a fitting meme to accompany the recent calls for the European museums to return cultural artworks and artefacts to China, to Easter Island, and to African countries such as Senegal.How ironic then that Black Panther was recently issued with a lawsuit for allegedly stealing the work of a Liberian-British artist for the set design in the film soundtrack’s video (Kendrick Lamar’s All the Stars). The Lion King wasn’t woke enough in 1994 to theorise its use of African culture, but the new remake has sharpened the stakes of the debate. Just as trademarking hakuna matata feels like a parody of Disney’s voracity, rendering an animation of animals into photographic realism raises too many questions about what’s real. New objections have arisen: why would Beyoncé’s black Texan voice be coming from Nala’s maw? (But why is it a human voice at all?) I’ll be honest. I’m a big fan of Disney films – I have The Little Mermaid and Aladdin practically memorised – but the first and second times I tried to watch The Lion King I fell asleep during the very opening scene. I finally made it through the film a few weeks ago, but I felt bored and annoyed. This is a picture of Africa I’ve been resisting my whole life: that we are just one giant safari that we sing and dance and cavort all day (“no worries!”) that we are only credible as beasts. Not only that, the Lion King can’t decide whether lion rules or human rules apply whether love comes in polygamous prides or monogamous brides whether kings come to power through bloodlines or bloodshed. The best kind of multicultural art immerses itself in the cultures it’s mixing, even the social practices of lions. Cultural appropriation isn’t just about freedom within an artistic marketplace: it has to be good in both senses. That means giving the art and the cultures in question figurative and literal credit.

I discover a lot of new music through my father-in-law and am grateful to have married into a family who share many of my interests and attitudes. Not everyone is so lucky. From friends, I’ve heard about Brexit rows across the dinner table, separate bedrooms imposed on couples in their 30s, interminable evenings with not enough wine. And I know from experience that, in spite of my good fortune, spending time cooped up with extended family over Christmas can still be a recipe for tension.My in-laws have always been kind to me but I used to struggle to reciprocate. “Boxing Day face” is my wife’s term for the blank expression I wore on 26 December 2007, as I sat mute through the annual leftovers ritual at her parents’ house, barely mustering the enthusiasm to lift my fork. This was due to my aversion to cold turkey. Had we been at my dad’s house, he’d have sliced and crumbled it over noodles, which would have been refreshing after all that roasted stuff.“Every family has a secret,” wrote Alan Bennett, “and the secret is that it’s not like other families.” Our in-laws are for many of us the first other family in which we’re immersed. When Bennett was growing up, his family’s big secret was that every day they ate their main meal for lunch instead of dinner. Baffling family habits are often food-based: I’ve watched aghast as my mother-in-law brought home fish and chips then warmed them in the oven. Song and solidarity count for nothing when faced with dried-out chips.My own parents orced and remarried decades ago, so my wife had to get used to two sets of in-laws and double the oddities. She’s rarely complained. Instead, she nods politely while my mum talks about people we’ve never met and, when we visit my dad, risks a migraine by drinking grappa with him. Are women more grown up about their in-laws? My mum’s eyes widen at the memory of the Chinese dumplings my dad’s dad cooked half a century ago, while my dad says he used to find it “challenging” going to my mum’s parents for Sunday lunch. He still sounds faintly wounded when adding that, at Blackburn Rovers matches, my granddad refused to stand next to him due to my dad’s long blue-streaked hair.Women’s relationships with their mothers-in-law are often complicated by having children, as I know from my time working for Mumsnet where every day countless threads appear about the crimes of MILs. I don’t have children and attribute some of my early frustrations to my in-laws giving me too little to complain about. I’m not the only one. In his novel Lucky Jim (1954), Kinglsey Amis channelled his resentment of his father-in-law into the comically awful character Professor Welch. When asked about this by a biographer, Amis’s ex-wife said her father was nothing but kind to Amis and would have been stunned to learn he was the model for Welch.You can be too fond of your partner’s family, as Carrie Bradshaw discovered in Shortcomings, the episode of Sex and the City in which Carrie became besotted with her boyfriend’s formidable Jewish intellectual mother but tired of the guy she was with. More recently, the American novelist Michael Chabon described how his affection for his father-in-law added to the pain of orce: “My father-in-law told me that the day my orce from his daughter came through was the saddest one in his life.”As with all important relationships, our feelings towards our in-laws evolve over time. In her diary, Virginia Woolf complained bitterly about her mother-in-law: “This shaky ramshackle old lady of 76 wore us out.” But after the old lady died, Woolf wrote movingly about her, and it’s worth remembering this festive period that one day we’ll probably look back fondly on the time we share with our in-laws. Learning to live happily within another family can be deeply rewarding. Although I’d still skip the cold turkey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c5e0c472ea2f8c1852b35e9cf8da7520207d71/358_56_2301_1381/master/2301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf4cded3c3b289bb356f690b8afe0f7f","title":"people of 2018 big dick energy buzz phrase","story":"The 27-year-old Twitter user from Toronto on the post that spawned this year’s buzz phraseI use Twitter like the world’s dumbest diary. I check in daily just to share some stupid thoughts, or look at memes, or see what article we’re all collectively mad about. I talk to real-life friends there, too. I have about 15,000 followers.The day Anthony Bourdain died, on 8 June, I tweeted: “We’re talking about how Anthony Bourdain had big dick energy which is what he would have wanted.” It’s a phrase I’d used with friends to refer to guys who aren’t that great but for whatever reason you still find attractive. The tweet got a normal amount of attention and as it was a phrase I’d used before, I didn’t think about it again.Maybe a month later I saw another Twitter user write about Ariana Grande’s boyfriend, Pete Davidson, and how he had “big dick energy”. I kept seeing that tweet, but because the nature of Twitter means no one has ownership over their ideas, I put it out of my mind. But then Grande referenced the size of Davidson’s penis in a tweet and it springboarded to everyone talking about (the now abbreviated) BDE. Overnight, it became part of pop culture. People were tweeting about it, creating memes, writing articles trying to explain it. I was just like, “Guys, it’s not that nuanced or deep.” I didn’t understand the obsession. I mean, I guess it’s catchy: B, D and E rhyme. And my peers are comfortable talking about energy and auras.The more I read other people writing about what it means, I started to get pissed off. None of the articles credited me. The Twitter user who wrote the Davidson tweet started saying she coined it. One of my friends was like, “Excuse me, you did not!” She apologised and said she got caught up in the excitement.Some of the articles were dead-ass wrong. BDE has less to do with confidence and more to do with personality and how you carry yourself. And you don’t need a dick to have it. Beyoncé’s the pinnacle of BDE. Diplo said he had it and originally I was like, “You do not.” But I saw he has a really dumb tattoo of a dinosaur, and anyone who’s able to pull that off has a huge dick. I don’t have BDE. I own the Hamilton soundtrack and anybody who owns that can’t have it. But what I think doesn’t matter. I realised everyone has their own definition that’s just how the internet works.It sucks because I made zero dollars from it. Well, almost zero. New York magazine sold slogan BDE T-shirts and were nice enough to give me the profits, of about $250. A while ago the Oxford English Dictionary cited the tweet about Davidson as starting it. I DM’d them, saying, “You’re wrong!” Then it made their word of the year shortlist and they were still saying the same thing about its origin. They credit me now.I’d love to move on, but the culture won’t let me. Ariana Grande’s new video for Thank U, Next has a scene with a guy in a UPS uniform, but instead of saying UPS it says BDE. The phrase is utterly useless to me and it doesn’t even matter that I coined it I’m still poor. But my friends are excited and I love that. And I stand by my original tweet: it’s what Anthony Bourdain would have wanted.As told to Candice Pires• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce130e2d14d9cbc88b5af98088832acba170c1c3/2793_1455_8600_5162/master/8600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c52b09b85894c247eef9722dda3e7a81","title":"uk buildings gaining listed status in pictures","story":"A prehistoric settlement, hangar buildings and a series of Robin Hood sculptures are among the more unusual heritage places gaining listed status this year.

But experts warn it is a “race against time” to discover many new species before they become extinct.Species hunters scouring the globe for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and its partners, this year found about 128 vascular plants and 44 species of fungi.The plants new to science include a species of allspice (used around the world in a variety of dishes), an insect-eating pitcher plant, a climbing species of yam, and an edible “hedgehog mushroom”.The largest organism newly listed by Kew this year is the Talbotiella cheekii, a rainforest tree which can grow up to 24 metres and which has fruit in exploding pods. Once thought to be common, it is endangered in Guinea, west Africa, because of clearance of the remaining fragments of rainforest on the coastal plain. Specimens bearing the lurid pink flowers – needed to fully identify the species – were found in 2017 beside the N1 highway just 28 miles from the centre of the capital, Conakry. The Kew plant hunter Xander van der Burgt, who found the tree, named the species after its first collector, Martin Cheek, a Kew botanist, who used Google Earth to locate promising-looking remnants of rainforest before travelling there to hunt for overlooked species.Cheek, a senior scientist within Kew’s “science identification and naming department”, said: “Finding a canopy rainforest tree that’s new and near an international highway and in an area of forest that’s all but gone is pretty unusual. But it was astounding because the Talbotiella is primarily a genus of Cameroon and Gabon. To find any Talbotiella species this far west was quite gobsmacking.”Cheek said it was “unbelievable” that we are still discovering species of plants and fungi new to science but warned that an increasing number of new finds, including Talbotiella cheekii, are in unprotected areas and highly vulnerable to extinction.He said: “When I began 30 years ago there was mostly nothing to suggest that new species I was publishing were about to go extinct. Increasingly I’m finding that species I’m describing are endangered or even extinct already.“There is no doubt it is a race against time. Until species are officially discovered and given a name, the International Union for Conservation of Nature won’t accept a conservation assessment for them. Then the species has got a better chance of surviving.”Cheek has published a paper detailing the discovery of a tree in Cameroon, called Vepris bali, which is thought to have become extinct before it had even been named. He hopes its naming will encourage people to search for it, after it was found some years ago in the Bali Ngemba forest reserve in Cameroon.“Many of these new species have potential benefits for humanity, from beautiful pot plants to new medicines or crops, but sadly we are finding that most of these new species are threatened with extinction due to habitat destruction, or are even likely extinct already.”Another plant, Lebbiea grandiflora (of the Podostemaceae family), a new genus featuring unusual pillar-like structures, was found in a waterfall in the Sewa river rapids in Sierra Leone. It is already classified as critically endangered due to threats from mining and a hydro-electric dam project. Scientists fear it will be extinct within the next two years and Cheek is planning to collect seeds in 2019 for ex-situ conservation.The slipper orchid, Paphiopedilum papilio-laoticus, was discovered on a black market in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, by Andre Schuiteman, another Kew scientist, who described the plant as an “outstanding but gravely endangered species of great horticultural potential”. That species is threatened because of commercial plant collectors illegally trading wild-collected native plants on local markets and over the internet.The delicate white flowering plant Kindia gangan, was found growing high on sandstone cliffs near Kindia, Guinea. Its finders believe its bell-shaped white flowers are pollinated by bats. Bright orange pollen later analysed by Melanie-Jayne Howes, a scientist at Kew, was found to contain more than 40 different triterpenoid chemicals, known for their medicinal value and of particular interest for anti-cancer research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a90e2d761c90b8bdb7b1a9cbc521e7d2d407eba/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27a9ff56914369f710bc0840e2c92aad","title":"lifestyle change eat less meat climate change","story":"Eating meat has a hefty impact on the environment from fueling climate change to polluting landscapes and waterwaysRecycling or taking the bus rather than driving to work has its place, but scientists are increasingly pointing to a deeper lifestyle change that would be the single biggest way to help the planet: eating far less meat.A swathe of research released over the past year has laid bare the hefty impact that eating meat, especially beef and pork, has upon the environment by fueling climate change and polluting landscapes and waterways.The mighty hoofprint of farmed meat isn’t just inefficient. Deforestation to make way for livestock, along with methane emissions from cows and fertilizer use, creates as much greenhouse gas emissions as all the world’s cars, trucks and airplanes. Meat rearing practices risk mass extinctions of other animals, as well as spawn significant pollution of streams, rivers and, ultimately, the ocean.Consumption of pork, milk and eggs will also need to decline sharply, all as the world’s population balloons by an extra 2 billion people by 2050. Researchers said there will need to be a global shift to a “flexitarian” diet to help keep the global temperature increase from breaching a 2C limit agreed by governments.A host of measures have been suggested in order to achieve this, ranging from a tax on red meat to feeding seaweed to cows to reduce methane escaping in their burps. Some advocates have promoted eating insects instead of steaks and pork chops.A more likely avenue may be the advance of vegetarianism via lab grown meats and the popularity of vegan substitutes such as the Impossible burger, which even ‘bleeds’. Whichever way change is achieved, there’s hope that 2019 will be a key year in the overhaul of a broken global food system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e562260d0097073720d54eab0642b29eb745adb9/0_0_4689_3255/master/4689.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=31614a312a05b3a4aed015cd4f36f25f 1400w","title":"humble hair clip accessory statement barrette","story":"From Selena Gomez to Holly Willoughby, the statement barrette has been adding a fashionable finishing touchAlexa Chung has long been a fan and regularly wears several at once. Ariana Grande has made a plain silver hair clip a signature, along with her high ponytail. But barrettes with a message are making the humble hair clip the accessory of choice this party season.Once reserved for bridal hairstyles, ornate barrettes – which come from the French word “barre” (meaning “bar”) – and statement hair grips are the fashion finishing touch this Christmas.Selena Gomez wore a diamante one spelling out the word “ugly” in September, which was seen as a response to Stefano Gabbana using the same adjective to describe her on social media earlier in the year.Holly Willoughby, to finish her stint on I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, posted an image of herself with three hair clips reading “jungle is massive”. It came with a pop-culture wink – referring to the reality TV show, of course, but also, unexpectedly, to M-Beat and General Levy’s 1994 drum’n’bass hit Incredible, and Ali G’s cover of the song in 2010.London designers are leading the party barrette trend. Ashley Williams’ diamante clips tap into the general mood of the nation. Bestsellers this winter include the “anxiety” and “error” designs. The high street is offering a series of purse-friendly options: Anthropologie sells pearl-covered clips for £22, Other Stories has a gold design for £8 and Monki has diamante hair pins for £6.The trend’s origin could stem from a revival of the name barrettes worn by black girls in the UK, Caribbean and US in the 1980s and 90s. Some of these hair clips would spell out days of the week as well as various girls’ names.Fashion insiders have been advocating this trend for a while, with the barrette-wearing Gwyneth Paltrow as Margot in the 2001 film The Royal Tenenbaums and Celine’s gold barrette on the catwalk in 2015 being key influences.Vogue’s fashion director, Venetia Scott, wrote in the magazine’s December issue about her collection of about 20 hair accessories from brands including Chanel and Alexandre de Paris. “A hair accessory can dress up any hairstyle,” she says. “It’s foolproof.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

A few days before, I make this vegan gravy flavoured with dried porcini and roast root veg for a silky texture and a hint of sweetness. The stuffing – also vegan – is flavour-packed, with fruitiness from apricots, smoky crunch from charred sourdough and depth from roast onions.This gravy freezes really well, so can be made up to three months ahead simply defrost and reheat. I use a mixture of root veg (whatever I have around), but remember that if you use squash, you will end up with a slightly orange-hued gravy, which will taste delicious but perhaps look a little less traditional. If you can’t get porcini, use two tablespoons of brown miso in one litre of water.120g chestnut mushrooms2 sticks celery, roughly chopped2 banana shallots or one onion, quartered200g root veg (squash, parsnip, sweet potato or carrot)4 sprigs thyme2 sprigs rosemary2 garlic cloves, left whole in their skins3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oilSalt and black pepper3 tbsp porcini mushrooms, soaked in 1 litre boiled water for 30 minutes2 tbsp plain flour300ml red wine1 ½ tbsp red wine vinegarHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)gas 6. Toss the mushrooms, celery, shallots, root veg, herbs and garlic in two tablespoons of the olive oil in a large roasting tray. Season generously and roast for 40 minutes, until the veg is soft and mashable. Use a potato masher to crush the veg and set aside.Heat the remaining oil in a pan, add the flour and fry for four minutes, until biscuit-brown. Slowly add the porcini stock, strained through a fine sieve to catch any grit, reserving the mushrooms, and stir through until the stock has thickened. Stir in the mushrooms and mashed veg, stir in the wine and vinegar, bring to a boil, then simmer for 25 minutes.Pass through a sieve until you have a smooth, thick gravy. Add water to loosen, if needed, and season well before serving.Instead of making this stuffing into a traybake as below, you could roll it into balls, toss them in a little olive oil and bake for 15 minutes, until golden.4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for greasing2 red onions, finely chopped3 sage leaves, shredded, plus extra to top1 sprig thyme, leaves only, plus extra leaves to top1 sprig rosemary, leaves choppedSalt and black pepper1 large garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped100g mixed nuts (50g pecans, 25g blanched almonds, 25g blanched hazelnuts, plus an extra handful for the top)6 chunky slices stale sourdough (275g)Zest of 1 lemon10 dried apricots, finely sliced150g cooked chestnuts250ml oat milkHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and grease a 1.5-litre ovenproof dish.

Add the garlic for the final minute.Meanwhile, roast the nuts in the oven for 10 minutes, until golden. Char the bread in the toaster or under the grill – the slices need to be slightly blackened.Tip the onion mix, nuts and toast into a food processor along with the zest, apricots, half the chestnuts and a generous pinch each of salt and pepper. Pulse until you have rough crumbs – it’s lovely to have chunks here and there. Transfer to a bowl.Blitz the remaining chestnuts in the emptied food processor with the oat milk and two tablespoons of oil, until you have a smooth puree.

He will be responsible for all elite England men’s sides while also overseeing the work of FA Education, aimed at increasing the number of qualified coaches, and he will work closely with the director of women’s football, Baroness Sue Campbell.“We are coming off the back of the most incredible year and I have nothing but respect for the outstanding work of Dan Ashworth and all the coaches and staff at St George’s Park,” Reed said. “The challenge will be to continue the progress that has been made and I hope I can bring my experience to help England teams. I am passionate about coaching, about helping English players to be the best they can be, and also want to work closely with the clubs and leagues we have in this country. I cannot wait to get started.”The 66-year-old worked at the FA in a coaching capacity from 1986 to 1995, and then held various technical roles – including as a member of Kevin Keegan’s coaching staff – between 1998 and 2004. The last two years of that second spell were spent as technical director, with his third stint to begin in February.

He is understood to have beaten Mark Warburton and Matt Crocker, the FA’s head of development team coaching, to the position, with Les Ferdinand and Kevin Thelwell, of Queens Park Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers respectively, also on the FA’s shortlist.“Les’s experience in the game is unrivalled so it is no surprise he came through a thorough recruitment process as the outstanding candidate,” said the FA’s chief executive, Martin Glenn. “It’s important we continue to develop strong relationships with the wider game for the benefit of English football and Les will be well-placed to continue to strengthen those relationships.”Glenn will depart the governing body at the end of the season.

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

I have a loving partner and enough to live on, and I am healthy enough to pursue several interests and some voluntary work in my community. I also have a home, some distance from family and old friends but large enough for when they visit. However, I want to be more of a grandparent than I am, and this sometimes makes me feel miserable.My partner’s grandchildren are young adults in their early 20s. I have one much-loved grandchild of primary school age, who lives 30 miles away. My daughter does her best to ensure we stay in touch and see each other when possible, but it is hard not to envy other grandparents, who live in the same town and are on tap for babysitting and sleepovers. My son has a long-term partner. I have no reason to believe they will not want a family one day, but even if they do, I will be too old for the hands-on role my dear grandmothers had in my life. They were in their mid-50s when I was born. I will be 20 years older, should I survive so long. I am, physically, already rather slower than I was 10 years ago and have recently been diagnosed with arthritis.My family situation has become common, now that more women put off having children until later in life, but I feel I do not have time to waste. I think I still have a lot to give. I could think about being an “independent visitor” for needy families locally, but would like some more ideas. Are there any suitable projects where I could volunteer my services for short periods of time?It is great that you want to be more involved. I think there are two aspects to this: the practical (what you can do immediately) and the emotional (the renunciation of what you thought being a grandparent would be like, and acceptance of what your life presents you with now).First: it is by no means a given that, if your son and his partner have children, you will be “too old” to help. You really don’t know. It is also wonderful that your daughter does all she can to insist that you are in touch with her child – and don’t forget that, as your grandchild grows, she or he will eventually be able to travel alone to see you. I know it is a way off yet, but it will happen. Also, don’t discount your older step-grandchildren. Being a grandmother isn’t just for babies – younger adults can find it hugely helpful talking to someone in the family who is not a parent.In terms of volunteering, you could try your local school (you will need to undergo a background check, but they would do this) most schools are desperate for help. I volunteer one morning a week at my local primary, taking the children for readingwritingvocabulary it is a wonderful antidote to my day job. Your GP surgery may know of local organisations check gransnet for “adopt a granny” schemes near you, and also home-start.org.uk, which looks for volunteers. You could consider nursing homes and hospices. And I can never mention anything to do with ageing without someone writing to tell me about the University of the Third Age, u3a.org.uk.I also contacted the psychotherapist Martin Pollecoff (psychotherapy.org.uk), a specialist in ageing matters. He felt that, while it is easy to look back to your childhood experience of your grandmothers, you have to accept that your own grandmotherly path may be a little different.“Re-conceptualise your life and look at the things you can do, rather than the things you cannot,” Pollecoff advised. This may sound obvious, but I do think you have been quite focused on what this part of your life should have been like: a little readjustment of expectations may be beneficial.“Grandchildren often fill the gap after retirement, so now you may have to mourn the things you haven’t got and haven’t done,” Pollecoff explained. “The way to get through this is to contribute to a new generation.”You have tons going for you, but could find something that allows you to be even more fulfilled.

It’s a salvo that draws you close, preparing to plunge you into the sensations she sings about. Sometimes, those are lascivious, but most often they’re alienating – reflecting how even a steady sense of self can be undermined by rejection. It is a sadder conclusion than you’d expect from a record perceived as a raunchy flex, but a truthful one: what if self-belief isn’t always enough? This album runs counter to empowerment pop’s current doctrine but feels more truthful for it. Read our full reviewSoon after Robyn released her era-defining 2010 album Body Talk, similar armour-plated bangers about female empowerment duly took over the charts. But pop moves fast and a new, woozier kind of tune by the likes of Ariana Grande and Dua Lipa has made such coldly strident numbers seem old-fashioned. So how would Robyn stay ahead of the game? By making a looser, clubbier album, one which had the intensity of a full-on dance record and a less ruthless approach to melody and which never sacrificed Robyn’s irresistible blend of sadness and euphoria. Read our full reviewA record about womanhood, and black womanhood in particular. “Remember when they used to say I look too mannish?” Janelle Monáe asks on Django Jane, a song that celebrates “black girl magic” while also acknowledging she has been treated as less-than by a Eurocentric industry. Having starred in two acclaimed, black-led films (Moonlight and Hidden Figures), and been a vocal proponent of the Black Lives Matter movement, this was not new territory for Monáe, but it was more overt than ever in her music. In letting go of her old alter ego and opening up, she created her best work yet. Read our full reviewBefore the Bronx rapper released her 2017-defining single Bodak Yellow, she was better known for snatching wigs on the VH1 reality show Love \u0026amp Hip Hop. Bodak Yellow changed the script: a brilliant track that earned pop cultural momentum from the novelty of Cardi’s melodic, withering flow. But what has made Invasion of Privacy a success a year later, the novelty of her debut having worn off, is her personality: steely realness shot through with a bolt of humour. Read our full reviewWith Be the Cowboy, Mitski continues to disrupt and update the conventions of indie rock. Gnarly guitars contrast with her extraordinarily nimble, pure voice there are upbeat disco numbers and delicate, ethereal piano ballads. As a rule, the cheerier songs conceal the bleakest sentiments. The album has an arch, dark humour that echoes Marry Me-era St Vincent, paired with an underlying maelstrom of high drama, loneliness and psychosexual dysfunction. Yet Mitski does not simply portray a victim there is a sense of fighting back against these forces. The title of the album exhorts the listener, and possibly the artist herself, to swagger. Read our full review.Addressing politics in pop can be a tricky balancing act, yet Idles frontman Joe Talbot charges across the tightrope in heavy boots, screaming in the face of the farce unfolding around him. There is untrammelled aggression in his voice, a directness that leaves spittle on your cheeks, but it is humour, not anger, that is his most devastating weapon. Beneath the rage and the humour, though, lie real human emotions: vulnerability, comradeship, warmth. Read our full review.Heaven and Earth can sound like a shout of frustration at the world’s ills, but it also offers hope in the brightness of its harmonised voices and the endless breath of its wind instruments. It is a searching record, one that reflects an artist casting about for the beliefs behind his music, but also one with an underlying energy to enact change: whether that change takes place within the mind or without, or whether that constitutes a difference at all. Read our full review.LSD and music are old bedfellows. You can hear the drug’s perspective-expanding effects on rock bands ranging from the Beatles to Tame Impala, while the word acid got added to house to describe the psychedelic weirdness of the squiggling basslines made by the Roland TR-303. Kacey Musgraves, who took LSD while writing her fourth album, Golden Hour, seems to use it to lightly expand her creativity. The results were not endless wig outs and lyrics about riding the snake to the ancient lake, but 13 excellent songs characterised by crystalline emotional and melodic clarity. Read our full review.No other woke pop or evisceration of Trump’s America sums up how 2018 frequently felt quite as well as Low’s Double Negative. The lyrics are oblique, but the music seems to be short-circuit and collapse in on itself, nothing working the way it was apparently supposed to. The album is marked by a sense of the familiar being snatched away. There are flashes of anger – as on Poor Sucker’s brutal depiction of a reactionary mindset in which the overriding aim is to make people you disagree with suffer – and even optimism. In a world of predictable political music, Double Negative seems unprecedented. Read our full reviewConceived intimately, on a piano received for his birthday, Alex Turner’s would-be solo album was significantly fleshed out by the rest of the band so the seams became invisible. Guitarist Jamie Cook slots inventively into the strange new shapes these songs took. Matt Helders caresses the drum kit with jazzbo sensitivity instead of pummelling it. The band’s collective backing falsettos never sounded so pitch- perfect. All these plush, disorienting textures – drawn from 60s France and film noir soundtracks, at once expansive and claustrophobic – speak of a small coterie of contributors and go-to producer James Ford going all in. Read our full reviewAlong with the other producers in the PC Music stable, at first, Sophie brilliantly highlighted the euphoria in J-pop and trance – and then, on her debut full-length, invested it all with emotional depth. The dance tracks are formidable in their mechanised, lubricated precision, and fabulous in their mane-preening confidence. But it was the ballads that truly stunned: as big as Bonnie Tyler, they don’t so much wear their heart on their sleeve as offer it to you on a plate. Read our full reviewSaxophonist and bandleader Shabaka Hutchings charges through Sons of Kemet’s third album at a relentless pace, playfully referencing Illuminati conspiracy theories surrounding the British monarchy and positing his own selection of alternative queens in the process. Backed by two drummers and the rumbling sub-bass of tuba player Theon Cross, Your Queen is a Reptile is a sensory assault that earned the band a Mercury prize nomination and a reputation for coruscating, politicised live performances. Read moreA band fast-becoming known for their solo projects as much as for their group work, the Internet’s latest offering continues the Aaliyah-infused R\u0026ampB and neo-soul grooves of their previous three LPs. Lead single Roll (Burbank Funk) plays off a Motown-inspired bassline to create a perfectly condensed three-minute earworm, while slower numbers like Hold On showcase singer Syd’s silken falsetto.

Room 25 progresses Warner’s blend of nonchalant yet eviscerating delivery over live instrumental backing and rich vocal melodies highlights include the jazzy calypso of Montego Bae and the D’Angelo grooves of Don’t Forget About Me.The 1970s soft-rock spirit of the likes of Nicolette Larson, Carly Simon and Laura Allan fill this sophisticated, superbly written collection of songs – but there are also touches of Haim’s pure pop (on the restless The Fire) and Erykah Badu’s jazz-funk (Hot for the Mountain and Ship Go Down). Lost, meanwhile, is one of the year’s best piano ballads. Read our full reviewThe music of Edinburgh trio Young Fathers can often feel like a lucid dream: equal parts joyous and unsettling. After winning the Mercury prize for their 2014 debut Dead, they have developed a distinct sound that blends earnest, infectious melodies with jittering, experimental backing.

He sounds brighter and more mischievous than he has in a while, enabled by West’s excellent production that played fast and loose with samples and bricolage beats. Read our full reviewFew artists made a greater leap forward this year than this Norwich duo, who swapped the psych whimsy of their debut for monstrous electronic pop. Woven into their synth battalions – the Sophie and Faris Badwan collaboration Hot Pink being particularly of note – are some of the year’s most incisive lyrics, on intimacy in an age of technological disconnect and the perils of underestimating young women.

There remains, true to form, beauty in the chaos she conjures, both in the cosseting string section and the sense of awe she exudes without affectation. Read our full reviewGiven the public support for Grande after her handling of the Manchester bombing, her fourth album could have been an easy victory lap. Instead, she pushes boundaries, particularly on Sweetener’s tracks with Pharrell: juxtaposing songwriterly piano ballads with trap, sampling angry right-wingers as she sings about hope, and documenting a panic attack with candour.

Their screwball energy is still there on Wide Awake, but erted into a wider range of sound than ever before: bluesy rock’n’roll on Freebird II, a honky-tonk knees-up on Tenderness, punk-funk shimmying on the title track. Read our full reviewTheir setup is pure British indie, but there’s a prickly, counterintuitive attitude to the south London band that gave them real edge.

All grungy fuzz and wailing melody, her playing veers from coolly nonchalant to intimate over the album’s 10 tracks. There’s a touch of 60s pop to Charity, while opener Hopefulessness evokes a Kurt Cobain dirge, and Need a Little Time playfully interjects dissonance into Barnett’s sweet chorus.

His astral-projected delivery, chopped and screwed or given Auto-Tuned warble, is a paradise of sing-song melody the beats, which take in straightforward trap as well as ambient and psychedelic rock, are universally strong and the guests, from a sunbaked Tame Impala to a glorious, vaginally fixated Weeknd, swim in and out in an affecting collageDev Hynes has had the kind of career growth most artists dream of. Turning the kitsch dance-punk of his band Test Icicles into the off-kilter introspection of his first solo project as Lightspeed Champion, as Blood Orange he now negotiates identity as a black man in contemporary America. Negro Swan is a conceptual masterwork, samples and jazzy saxophone lines linking bedroom pop, neo-soul and downbeat hip-hop. Read our full reviewIn one sense, the debut by Melbourne’s RBCF sees them join a great lineage of Australian jangle-pop bands. But the bright precision and outward-looking lyricism of their long-awaited debut (following two acclaimed mini-albums) distinguished them from slouches and shoegazers past: their three singer-guitarists Tom Russo, Fran Keaney and Joey White elegantly countenance privilege, pleasure and the impact of colonialism on this moving and invigorating record.

MITH is a truly visionary trip through contemporary US politics, slavery, the cosmic order and the sheer joy of expression, with a kind of unravelled blues and gospel spinning around Holley’s glottal holler. Read our full reviewAmid today’s strong slacker-indie scene, the debut album from 19-year-old Lindsey Jordan still stands out thanks to her voice – bell-clear at times, she modulates into a dismayed, yearning tone, topped with a touch of vocal fry. Her teenage angst is backed by dolefully strummed electric guitar, adding up to rainy-day music of the highest quality.As Years \u0026amp Years did on this year’s Palo Santo, Australian solo artist Sivan took a step away from mainstream pop on his second album, Bloom, and one towards the queer avant-garde pop of Perfume Genius. The result is bracing: gothic touches and New Romantic grandeur create the perfect stage for Sivan’s songwriting, often rooted in his experiences of love and lust as a young gay man. Read our full reviewWith a mulch of Abba-y disco-pop, trip-hop, rockabilly, glam rock and more, Meg Remy truly levelled up on her seventh release. A pissed-off scorn charges each track, whether she’s dealing with domestic violence, childhood trauma or industrial chemicals making families infertile, and Remy’s croon – like an embittered music hall singer – seals this stunningly original album. Read our full reviewIt’s likely that the Welsh songwriter’s second album will forever remain the world’s only Cornish language synth-pop album that reimagines the county as a cosmopolitan hive of industry. But even if anyone did fancy trying to steal Gwenno’s title, it is unlikely they’d pull it off as well as she does here, interweaving deeply researched history, emotionally resonant fantasy and utopia-within-reach into a cohesive and spellbinding whole. Read our full reviewAllen’s revelatory memoir ended up overshadowing No Shame, but her fourth album warrants further attention, and not just because she makes many of the same confessions about her failings and unfaithfulness within its 14 tracks. Like her classic debut, Alright, Still, it seamlessly integrates the sound of contemporary London into smart pop music – and almost erases all memory of 2014’s dire Sheezus in the process.

The solos are virtuosic and uplifting, the blast-beats cleansing, and the post-rock ballads so simple and affecting. Still anyone’s guess what George Clarke is roaring about, mind. Read our full reviewJunglism is the energy that churns deep under this massively atmospheric record from shadowy Munich producer Skee Mask: there are some straightforwardly ravey numbers, like Dial 274, but the breakbeats often mutate before they reach the surface. On 50 Euro to Break Boost they’re blown out and distorted on Kozmic Flush they’re high-speed and skittering on Rev8617 they’re slowed into pretty hip-hop. Fans of Metalheadz and classic Warp will find much to love here.Kindness is often wrongly considered a twee emotion, the sentiment of cross-stitched homilies and that weepy girl who sneaks into the reconciliation at the end of Mean Girls. But on this Arizona-born songwriter’s sixth album, Andrews summons Americana heft to give empathy the weight it deserves, advocating for extending tenderness to ex-lovers, strangers and refugees alike. Read our full reviewFor her second collaboration with producer Four Tet, trip-hop queen Neneh Cherry takes a quieter turn, focusing her soulful voice on issues including the refugee crisis and the environment, set to twinkling bells and dub. Elements of the Bristol scene that first brought her to fame remain, with Massive Attack’s 3D stopping by, although it’s the steel drum-aided jazz of Natural Skin Deep where Cherry reaches her peak.

In his debut full-length, Wise’s crystalline voice cuts through synthetic melodies, choral harmony and an unsettling rumble of experimental electronics to create an album of intimacy and challenging performativity. Read our full reviewIt’s been a great year for grown-up pop: Florence Welch, the 1975, Lily Allen and Neneh Cherry have all made boundary-pushing albums about, well, pushing boundaries as pop stars over the age of 30. Chief among them is Tracey Thorn’s fifth solo album, where her admirably plainspoken quotidian concerns anchor transcendent acid-tinged disco. Read our full reviewThai funk and Texan desert rock might not seem like usual bedfellows, but Houston-based trio Khruangbin have united the two in a cinematic instrumental blend over a series of releases since 2010. Con Todo El Mundo, their second album, is a soothing sunset ride: all infectious wah-wah guitar and languorous basslines underpinned by drum grooves that lay deep in the pocket.Ignoring verse-chorus-verse rules in favour of lulling repetition and circuitous logic, Wanderer’s songs are as itinerant as the title suggests. Chan Marshall’s pumice-stone voice slinks around chiming notes on piano or acoustic guitar, resulting in bluesy ruminations. But there are moments of pop, too: the gathering rush of the chorus on Woman, a duet with Lana Del Rey, and her authoritative piano ballad cover of Rihanna’s Stay.

The ambience of his previous work with Brian Eno is an underlying presence as Singularity brings in club atmospheres before maintaining emotional equilibrium with calmer moods. A manifesto for a new kind of dancefloor mindfulness, perhaps. Read our full reviewGoat Girl’s first release in 2016 lamented: “How can an entire nation be so fucking thick?” Following this pithy post-Brexit-vote line, their debut album continues the disaffection, with singer Clottie Cream drawling through 19 tracks of fuzzy guitar, pounding drums and lyrics taking aim at everything from public transport sexual harassers to the Tories and the DUP, who they suggest could form a pyre in Burn the Stake.

That is when a boy treble from the choir of King’s College, Cambridge – chosen by music director Stephen Cleobury from his shortlist of possible soloists just seconds before the service begins – sings the opening verse of Once in Royal David’s City live on Radio 4.A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols has flourished despite the fact that society has become more secular, but Cleobury sees no contradiction in that. “The service, as with our regular evensong in term time, is open to everybody,” he says. “It’s very important that we do the right thing by people of genuine Christian conviction, but it’s also important that we welcome and include people who have different views, including those who have lost all faith or who come from different faiths. “We are providing something that people can connect with in different ways. Hearing Once in Royal David’s City or In the Bleak Midwinter connects people with something earlier in their life and provides a solace of some kind.”This year’s festival has particular significance. It is 100 years since the service began, the brainchild of King’s College dean Eric Milner-White, who wanted a service that could unite and inspire people after the horrors of the first world war, and 90 years since it was first broadcast on BBC radio. It is also Cleobury’s final outing after 37 years as music director – he will be 70 on 31 December and retires next year after an epic stint (second among King’s music directors only to Arthur Henry Mann, who managed a remarkable 53 years from 1876 to 1929).It has proved a challenging final year for Cleobury. In March he was knocked over by a cyclist – a very Cambridge accident – and fractured his skull. Happily, after a short layoff, he was back leading the choir. Then, earlier this month, opera singer Lesley Garrett directed a broadside against King’s all-male choir (it is made up of 16 boy choristers and 14 male undergraduate choral scholars), calling it a “throwback to a bygone age” and demanding that girls be allowed in. It led to a lively debate to which Cleobury, until now, has not responded.“It’s an interesting subject,” he tells me, “but not something that can be dealt with in soundbites. We haven’t gone for a mixed choir in the chapel choir, but we have made significant contributions to opportunities for girls to sing in other ways.” He points out that during his time as music director, the college has started King’s Voices, a mixed choir of undergraduates that has given women the chance to sing in the chapel at evensong every Monday. He has also launched King’s Junior Voices, which brings 100 children every weekend to the choir school attached to the college to learn to sing. Of those, he says, two-thirds are girls. Cleobury doesn’t defend keeping a boys-only choir, as some do, in terms of the quality or uniqueness of the sound. “For me that is not the main issue,” he says, “because you can listen to boys’ choir X and boys’ choir Y and they’ll sound different. Likewise with girls’ choirs. It depends how they’re trained and on the sort of sound the choir director has in mind.” The real reason to maintain boys-only choirs, he argues, is that boys need to be encouraged to sing. When choirs are opened up to girls, they tend to overwhelm them, outnumbering the boys and perhaps making them feel self-conscious, and if boys aren’t being trained between the ages of eight and 13 the production line of male singers starts to dry up. “Boys – certainly in the presence of girls – feel that singing isn’t a cool thing to do,” he says. “But they are the tenors and basses of tomorrow. Neglect them and you won’t have your symphony chorus, so you won’t have your Beethoven Nine or your Missa Solemnis or your Dream of Gerontius being performed.”But will it be sustainable in the future for the BBC to have a boys-only choir for its Christmas showpiece? “I’m not in the business of prediction,” he says, explaining that it would be for the college authorities to change the composition of the chapel choir. At some point, though, the BBC will come under pressure to rule on the issue, and whether they will be willing to hold the line is a moot point. Traditional practice and gender equality make for discordant partners.The radio version of the service is broadcast live the TV version which goes out at 5.50pm on BBC2 on Christmas Eve was recorded a few weeks ago. Traditionalists will favour the radio broadcast, in part because it integrates the biblical Christmas story and the carols more organically – Cleobury says he chooses the music to match the readings and that it is not merely “a selection of all our favourite carols” – but also because of the unpredictability of live performance. Is Cleobury fearful of things going wrong? “I wouldn’t use the word fearful,” he says, “but I’ve never gone into it with any sense of complacency. I try to get appropriately geared up – that’s a combination of preparation in advance and concentration in the moment.” The college estimates that more than 100 million people around the world listen to A Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service and on 450 public radio stations in the US, where it has a very loyal audience. The TV version, Carols from King’s, gets more than 2 million viewers in the UK. For his valedictory service, Cleobury has chosen half a dozen carols that were sung at the first service in 1918 and also included arrangements by his five predecessors as music director. It will be an attempt to sum up a century of Christmases at King’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d445b90ee5aa17950e85fc83cb85875a0a0bfdb1/0_120_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73463175b419a179afaa6c5aaffea5d6","title":"tell us what was your album of 2018","story":"We will publish a selection of readers’ favourite albums before the end of the yearAfter canvassing over 50 of our music writers and totting up their votes, we’ve announced our 50 best albums of the year, topped by Christine and the Queens’ sensual neo-boogie classic Chris.But a list of 50 –\u0026nbspand you can see the whole thing here – inevitably misses out out dozens of brilliant albums, so we’d love to hear from you about the recordings you think were unfairly overlooked by our vote.

Imagine what it is like trying to find a gift for the person who has it all – and a million or two in the bank.If there is a fan of high heels to rival Imelda Marcos in your life, how about treating them to a private dinner inside Jimmy Choo’s flagship Bond Street store? The company promises that those buying private access to the store will be able to “dine and shop in style, entirely privately”. Hiring out your choice of Jimmy Choo stores – from London, Rome, Milan or Vienna – costs a minimum of £60,000.“We will create a three-course meal with all of her favourite things. We decorate the store with the most amazing floral arrangements and she and her friends will have the chance to shop the collection. This is an opportunity to really show you’re a Jimmy Choo fan.”The company, which was founded by the designers Jimmy Choo and Tamara Mellon in 1996 but is now owned by Michael Kors, also suggests customers might like to buy a leather shoe trunk for £45,000 – which again does not include any shoes. The Bond Street store has sold out of the Memento trunk but the company says it can be ordered from other stores in Europe.“I wanted to unashamedly celebrate a woman’s love affair with shoes and create a one-of-a-kind environment to house her most treasured pairs,” Sandra Choi, Jimmy Choo’s creative director and niece of Choo’s wife, Rebecca, says. “I wanted the trunk to be exceptional and to be the ultimate expression of luxury and glamour.”Stéphanie Watine Arnault, the 35-year-old niece of Bernard Arnault, Europe’s richest person and the chief executive of the luxury goods company LVMH, has also launched a bespoke club selling exceptional experiences to the world’s richest people.Watine Arnault says she launched the Clos19 club to allow customers behind-the-scenes access to the “extraordinary world” of LVMH’s most famous brands, including Dom Pérignon and Krug champagne. “I realised that nobody was talking to me or my generation, it was all for connoisseurs,” she says. “The technical aspects – the right temperature, the right glass, the right pairing for champagne – can be a bit boring. But, if you look at it from a lifestyle perspective, where you can set a scene, it can become very playful.”Her Christmas gift recommendations include an “epic experience” to Antarctica in which customers will discover a “breathtaking landscape while enjoying private ice-inspired tastings outside and fire-inspired dinners in the luxury camp”. The cost of the eight-day trip, which includes flights on a specially commissioned jet landing on a “custom-carved ice runway”, is not disclosed.Other experiences offered by Clos19, which is named after the French term for a walled vineyard and a reference to the 19th century when champagne began to be widely consumed, include a trip to Cloudy Bay Vineyards in New Zealand, complete with a jaunt on a luxury yacht for £10,000.Or there’s a private tasting session of six different Krug cuvée champagnes, matched with a bespoke six-course menu carefully created by the two-Michelin star chef Hélène Darroze, for £8,500.For £12,000, Watine Arnault promises to fly couples by helicopter from London to the Berkshire village of Bray for lunch at Alain Roux’s three Michelin-starred Waterside Inn, featuring “a superb seasonal tasting menu, with Clos19 champagne pairings”.The trip also includes a night at Cliveden House, a country estate that has welcomed guests including Charlie Chaplin, Winston Churchill and every British monarch since George I. On the return to London – not by helicopter - customers will be granted access to the Louis Vuitton private apartment on New Bond Street, where “rare antiques and artwork by the likes of Koons, Basquiat and Kapoor await”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2755050958416b2a0101c60007bf4ace9e3f17ed/0_0_3333_2222/master/3333.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f5d8f4ecd8dcb20c5632e9b33b4399 480w","title":"sadiq khan denies he was told earlier about crossrail delays","story":"London mayor tells assembly there is no ‘smoking gun’ over overrunning rail projectSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said the former chair of Crossrail was “misremembering” whether he had been given warnings about delays to the London railway project.Speaking at the London assembly, Khan denied he was told in a meeting with Sir Terry Morgan on 26 July that the infrastructure project would be delayed. Khan told the assembly’s transport committee there was no “smoking gun”.Morgan, who resigned as chairman of Crossrail this month after nine years, said Khan knew as early as late July that it would not be ready on time. This is contrary to the mayor’s claim that he did not know of the delay until shortly before the postponement was announced on 31 August.Speaking to the  following Khan’s appearance on Friday, Morgan said he was “not backing off one jot” from his earlier assertion that Khan was told of the delay on 26 July. He pointed to a document from the 26 July meeting, published by the mayor’s office, in which a December opening was described as “not feasible”.The railway, running from east to west across London, was due to be opened in December but has been dogged by delays and cost overruns. The estimated final cost of Crossrail has risen sharply this year by £600m to £15.4bn, forcing Transport for London (TfL) to borrow £350m.The railway, to be named the Elizabeth Line after the Queen, is not expected to open until autumn 2019.In sometimes-heated exchanges at the London assembly, Khan and Mike Brown, the commissioner for Transport for London, said Morgan had insisted in July the December deadline was achievable. Khan, a former Labour MP, also denied there had been “collusion” between members of his team to conceal their knowledge of the delays.However, Khan and Brown admitted they had concerns about delays and that they were not “fully reassured” following the meeting. TfL and the Department for Transport commissioned an external report into the project.The assembly’s transport committee chair, Caroline Pidgeon, said: “Someone between these two parties is not giving a full account and we will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89de19354212802c8a95f500c6a5a26d24f80a2f/181_468_3039_1824/master/3039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=194bce0832dc3a9a7644033d71b89cc8","title":"operation on wrong testicle two year old boy bristol","story":"Bristol hospital apologises for mistake as father says surgeons have ‘ruined my son’A hospital trust has apologised to the family of a two-year-old boy who will grow up infertile after surgeons operated on the wrong testicle.The boy was admitted to Bristol Royal hospital for children this week to treat an undescended testicle. His father told the BBC that surgeons operated on the wrong one by mistake and “castrated” him.The University Hospitals Bristol NHS foundation trust apologised and said it had launched an investigation.The boy’s father, whose name has not been revealed to protect his son’s identity, said the child’s undescended testicle was discovered during a routine checkup. The toddler was referred to a specialist and he was booked in for the operation on Monday.The family said they were told the procedure carried minimal risk and it would be over in around 30 minutes. “We were waiting and waiting,” the father told the BBC. “After two and a half hours the manager, surgeons and consultants came and I knew something was not right.“Me and my wife started panicking, they called us into the office and told us things didn’t go right and the operation wasn’t a success.”The couple said they were told that a surgeon’s mistake meant their son’s healthy testicle would never work. “I was very distressed, it was an awful disaster for a simple operation. They destroyed everything and they ruined my son,” the father said. “They castrated him and now my son’s future life has dramatically changed.”The boy’s mother said: “They broke my heart and they basically destroyed his future. I can’t find the words to explain how I’m feeling. I have no more tears. We just hope for a miracle.”The trust’s medical director, Dr William Oldfield, said: “On behalf of the trust, I am deeply sorry that a serious incident has occurred in the treatment of a young child in our care and would like to offer our sincerest apologies.“As soon as our staff realised what had happened they met with the family to offer their apologies and explain what had happened.

Baie Des Iles, trained by her husband, Ross O’Sullivan, is being lined up for next week’s Welsh Grand National and has shortened to a general 12-1 in recent days as punters begin to see possibilities in the grey mare, last sighted in this country when giving Walsh her final spin around Aintree in the National itself.“She’s in good form,” Walsh told me on Thursday. “Her first run back of the season was in France, she ran very well to a point. She took a blow, so she’s come on from that. She ran in the Welsh National two years ago as a five-year-old. She’s a bigger, stronger mare now. It’s a great pot, she has a nice weight and the conditions suit, so she’s got to go and take her chance.”Baie Des Iles evidently attracted some support for the Aintree National, judging by her starting price of 16-1. She managed no better than 12th but Walsh says that should not be taken at face value.“It was a great experience, lovely to be able to ride her for Ross. She’s a super jumper and she took to the fences well. I was getting a great spin but, like so many other people in the National, we didn’t get the luck that you need. She got badly bumped by a loose horse at Valentine’s and lost her chance.“I hunted her home, looked after her, there wasn’t a bother on her and she came out of it well, went to France a few weeks later and won a big race in Auteuil.”Walsh rides out at O’Sullivan’s yard and spends her evenings chewing over work plans and running plans with her husband, but most of her work life these days is taken up with the yearlings she keeps at her father’s place, “literally half a mile away across a field”, where she prepares them for eventual resale.I ask if she has any regrets about retirement. “Not at all, absolutely love it. I had a great career, I miss it but I’m very busy between Dad’s and Ross’s. It was the right time to go. I didn’t want to go when I wasn’t getting rides any more.”Cheekily, I ask if she has ever raised the subject of retirement with her older brother. “Absolutely not!” she says, sounding genuinely horrified. “Jeez, I wouldn’t even bring that up. No, definitely not. Ruby won’t be going anywhere, I’d say, for a very long time.”And so to Friday’s fascinating card at Ascot, where Brianstorm (1.20) appeals at 9-2 in the novice handicap chase. Formerly with Warren Greatrex, who tried him in Grade One company as a hurdler, he raced freely and appeared to need the run when well beaten on his debut for Venetia Williams at this course last month.Soft ground will help but fences ought to make a still more significant difference to this one, the easy winner of an Irish point a couple of years ago. There might not be much depth to this race and he’s on a useful looking mark.There’s 11-4 half an hour later about Thomas Darby (1.55), who bumped into a quality rival when beaten a head here last month. That was a fine effort, considering he ran freely in a steadily run race, and I’m sticking with this half-brother to the classy Muirhead, who once chased home Brave Inca in the Irish Champion Hurdle.In the novice chase, Count Meribel (2.30) could be the best option at 100-30. He recovered well from a late mistake to get his second win over fences at Cheltenham last time and I remember the way he  round here as a hurdler last season. Lil Rockerfeller can only be watched after his mishap last time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0df7fc3a9e27eedee10d15b4b279aabb6e1f55e3/0_0_2544_1527/master/2544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f50397f9528dc190f84db1a5cf14fc79","title":"berwick kaler 40 years panto dames gary oldman cat york theatre royal","story":"After four decades of festive fun in York, the actor and writer is hanging up his frock and hobnailed boots. He looks back at the Theatre Royal’s panto family‘I must say I never expected there to be quite this much fuss,” Berwick Kaler says, indicating towards the tsunami of cards and messages of goodwill that have poured through his letterbox since he made the announcement that his 40th pantomime as York Theatre Royal’s incorrigible, hobnail-booted dame would be his last. Top of the heap is a card from Imelda Staunton, who started her career in rep with Kaler at York alongside is a huge bouquet of flowers from the Old Vic’s artistic director, Matthew Warchus.“I gave Matthew his first job in theatre,” Kaler says fondly, “taping up the corners of Wagon Wheel packets so they wouldn’t hurt people when we flung them into the audience.”Kaler is recuperating after the opening weekend of this year’s show at his home overlooking the triangular village green in the quaint York suburb of Acomb. If not quite the house that pantomime built, it’s certainly the house that pantomime paid for: “The people of York will always be dear to my heart since they’ve cleared my mortgage,” he says. Yet the reason for the outpouring of public affection can be found in Kaler’s pantomime titles: Aladdin and the Twankeys the York Family Robinson Robin Hood and his Merry Mam. Kaler doesn’t just have an audience, he has a family, to whom he feels a deep sense of responsibility.“I’m genuinely walking around in a bit of a daze, thinking what have I done?” he admits. “Should I have just kept my mouth shut and announced on the last night that it was the final one? But the reason I’m stopping is that I cannot bear to let anybody down. I don’t want anyone leaving the theatre saying, ‘I remember Berwick before he completely lost his marbles.’”Kaler intimated that he would call time either when he reached his 70th birthday or his 40th pantomime. That first landmark passed two years ago, since when he has undergone major heart surgery and been fitted with a pacemaker that he refers to throughout the show as Gerry: “I think people assumed I could go on for ever, as if I were a machine,” he says. “Well, now I am. But to be honest, it’s the little aches and niggles that slow you down. I’ve had countless sprains, broken my nose and almost choked on shaving foam, but my proudest claim is that in 40 years I have never missed a single performance.”Ultimately, Kaler believes that pantomime has been the panacea which keeps him going: “After all, it’s the only exercise I get.” So is it likely that he will follow the example of Britain’s other most venerable dame, Kenneth Alan Taylor, who announced his retirement from Nottingham Playhouse in 2001 and again in 2008, before finally hanging up his wig for good in 2012? Since Taylor, now 81, continues to write and direct the annual Nottingham entertainment, can Kaler see himself continuing his authorial role?“It’s tempting, and I’ve already got some ideas about where to take the show next,” he says. “But the problem with writing is that it means delivering a script. Every spring I sit here gazing at the trees budding on the green and think I really ought to make a start on the first act. And every autumn I watch the leaves fall as the theatre management sends panicked messages saying where is it?”Audiences are used to Kaler’s famously plot-less pantomimes bearing only a tangential resemblance to the fairytale on the poster. This year he found himself sailing particularly close to the wind, arriving on the first day of rehearsals with only half the scenes sketched out.“It is a dangerous way of working,” he admits, “and I couldn’t do it without the support of an incredible cast.” He refuses to speculate on which of his stoically loyal pantomime family would be willing or able to assume the vacant frock. Prime candidates might seem to be Martin Barrass (who has chalked up 32 years as the dame’s half-witted son) or David Leonard, baddie to this parish of 29 years standing. What can safely be discounted is the return of Gary Oldman, who appeared in 1979’s Dick Whittington in the role of the cat.“Gary has gone on to become one of our greatest screen actors but I’m afraid he was a bit of a lightweight when it came to pantomime,” Kaler recalls. “He kept fainting inside the costume. On at least three occasions I had to turn to the audience and say, ‘Oh dear, boys and girls, I think the poor pussy cat has gone to sleep!’”So how does Kaler see himself filling the new year without a pantomime to procrastinate over? “I might make a start on my memoirs,” he muses. “I’ve got a full cabinet of Dickens over there that I am determined to read before I take my leave. But when I do, I intend to be buried on Acomb Green. And on my headstone they will write: ‘He finally found a plot.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72b02f10f77c3f46a59624281bb1b6c2132b2446/0_239_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90c5e6b81883d57bc084a035718e7c75","title":"hal crutenden funniest things","story":"The standup, writer and actor on the things that make him laugh the mostI saw Joan Rivers host the gala at the Montreal comedy festival in 2008.

He is also reportedly planning to halve the US troop presence in Afghanistan.The resignation deprives Europe of one of its most reliable interlocutors and a firm supporter of the Nato transatlantic alliance. It is seen in Europe as an alarming symbol of Trump’s determination to take personal charge of foreign policy, and the pointed reference in his resignation letter to the need to treat allies with respect will echo across a continent alienated by the president’s insults and caprice. Above all, however, the resignation shows the depth of the foreign policy chasm between Trump and even mainstream Republicans on the US’s responsibilities to Europe and the Middle East.UK defence and foreign ministers, habitually inclined to keep differences with the US out of public sight, openly criticised Trump’s decision. The Middle East minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: “There are no vacuums in foreign policy, certainly not in the Middle East. In a fragile region every action is a catalyst for another. If allies cannot be relied upon, others are sought to take their place. Jim Mattis understood – vital any successor agrees.”The tweet is a warning to the US that the Gulf states, as well as the Kurds, may deduce that the US pullout means their long-term interests may lie in allying with other more steadfast partners such as Russia or China. Russia has been increasingly active in the Middle East, and now seems certain to emerge as the victor that protected the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. Other Arab countries are preparing to recognise Assad as victor by sending diplomats to Damascus.The UK defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, also praised Mattis as “trusted, respected and admired by friends and allies, as well as feared and revered by our foes”. He tweetedwitter: “The most impressive military mind I’ve had the honour to know. Jim my friend – our world will be less safe without you.”Ellwood had previously clashed with Trump’s assessment that Islamic State had been defeated in Syria. “It had morphed into something else,” he said.The UK ambassador to the UN and a former political director at the Foreign Office, Karen Pierce, also clashed with Trump, pointing out that the UK air force is currently active over Syria, and the job of defeating Isis was far from over.Germany, the country that had most to benefit from an agreed political settlement in Syria in terms of returning refugees, also insisted that Isis remained a security threat.The sense of a transatlantic crisis spread across the European foreign policy establishment. The co-chair of the European council on foreign relations Carl Bildt tweeted: “A morning of alarm in Europe. Sec Def Mattis is the remaining strong bond across the Atlantic in the Trump administration. All the others are fragile at best or broken at worst.”The French president, Emmanuel Macron, was discussing with allies whether a supported French presence could act as a temporary substitute for the departing US ground troops in Syria.Attempts were also being made to discover from a chaotic Washington administration how quickly the 2,000 US troops in north-east Syria were leaving, and, separately, how quickly Turkish troops plan to go over the border into Syria to attack what Ankara regards as Kurdish terrorist havens under the instruction of the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.The sense of anger, edging on defiance, at Trump’s decision was clearest in Paris. The French defence minister, Florence Parly, said on RTL radio: “We do not share the analyses that the territorial caliphate has been annihilated. It’s an extremely grave decision, and we think the job must be finished. While the territory controlled by the caliphate is no longer what it was in 2014 ... if it has been reduced to near nothing, there remains, however, a pocket where jihadists have bunkered down,” she said.Parly also suggested that implementing the withdrawal of 2,000 US soldiers from Syria should be discussed by the allied coalition. “You can’t withdraw troops from one day to another,” she said.Macron has invited two leaders of the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to Paris to discuss how to protect the Kurds from what may now be an attack either by Isis, Turkish forces or Syrian government forces.“The two co-chairs of the Syrian Democratic Council (MSD) Riad Darar and Ilham Ahmed are expected in Paris,” said SDF’s representative Khaled Issa, referring to the political arm of the previously US-backed militia that has formed the backbone of the fight against Isis.France has about 1,100 troops in Iraq and Syria, providing logistics, training and heavy artillery and air support. It has dozens of special forces, military advisers and some foreign ministry personnel in Syria.Macron spoke to Trump on Tuesday night, diplomats said. “The military campaign against Islamic State continues,” the French army spokesman Patrik Steiger told a news conference. “At this stage, the announcement by the American president has no impact on France’s ongoing participation.”Even if a European force in Syria to combat Isis and protect the Kurds proves unrealistic, underlining the lack of its independent military capability, European politicians were fuming at the manner of Trump’s decision-making. Neither the Syrian withdrawal nor the prospect of cutting troop numbers in Afghanistan were preceded by any serious consultation with his European allies, many of whom either have ground troops or air forces operating in both countries.The former UK ambassador to Lebanon Tom Fletcher spoke of “storm clouds darkening”.Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Liberal Democrat group in the European parliament, said: “A victory for Russia, Iran, Turkey, Turkish proxies \u0026amp the Syrian regime. Unsurprisingly, it leaves Europeans more vulnerable – and shows how wrong it is that we do not have a defence force able to help stabilise our immediate neighbourhood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36c4934a68c09fa79a31bf5e4f765c9afbabb5a6/0_176_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef686026c25d6b5d1940b15a8260e6d0","title":"belgian king accepts prime minister charles michel resignation say reports","story":"The king of Belgium has accepted the resignation of Charles Michel as prime minister but asked him to stay on at the head of a caretaker government until elections are held in May.Michel, a Francophone liberal, had led a four-party coalition government that fell earlier this month when the largest party, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), quit over objections to a UN migration pact.Subsequent efforts to relaunch as a minority administration failed and Michel submitted his resignation on Tuesday after losing a confidence vote.The Belgian king, who plays an unusually active role for a constitutional monarch, accepted Michel’s resignation on Friday after meeting leaders from most of Belgium’s political parties at the palace in recent days.A statement from the palace carried by state broadcaster RTBF said King Philippe had asked Michel to lead a government of “current affairs”, effectively a caretaker administration. The king said that following his meetings he saw “political will to guarantee the good management of the country until the next elections.He also called on politicians to provide “an appropriate response to the economic, budgetary and international challenges” and meet the population’s expectations on “social and environmental levels”.The statement appears to end speculation about snap elections in the new year. The “orange-blue” coalition, made up of Flemish Christian Democrats, Flemish liberals and Michel’s French-speaking liberal party, is expected to continue in office.A caretaker administration is a familiar concept to Belgians. The country went 589 days without a government during a political crisis in 2010 and 2011, setting a record that was only recently surpassed by the Northern Ireland executive. Caretaker governments are not able to make major decisions and budgets are are drawn up on the basis of the previous year’s numbers.Michel’s government was an experiment for Belgium, which is ided into a richer Flemish-speaking region and a French-speaking part that is struggling to deal with industrial decline. A fragile four-party coalition, it included the N-VA, which officially wants an independent Flanders, but only one Francophone party, Michel’s liberals.The N-VA announced earlier this month that it was quitting the government because it would not support a UN migration compact. Despite its non-binding nature, Donald Trump’s administrationand several EU member states, including Austria and Hungary, rejected the pact. Belgian political analysts think the N-VA took a tough line because it feared losing votes to the far-right Vlaams Belang in the May elections.About 5,500 people attended an anti-migration protest organised by Vlaams Belang in Brussels on Sunday, when police used water cannon and teargas to disperse people."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"John Conway applies for judical review of refusal of permission for Dublin city projectCreed announces restrictions on vessels more than 18m long due to start in 2020Adjudication officer found hug was \u0026lsquoparticularly ill-conceived action\u0026rsquoEoin Morrissey (19) appears in court over death of senior Real IRA figure in CorkTownsend Street venue, popular with Trinity students, to be demolished early next yearGreg Walsh (70) admitted thefts from voluntary organisation, family and friendsCourt told house was decorated for Christmas and man \u0026lsquosmashed every lightbulb\u0026rsquoGerard Brown says Stephen Cooper wanted to be attacked to secure transfer to open jailBasics like tea, cheese, cold meats and biscuits provided at Capuchin centreMaha Al Adheem found not guilty of autistic boy\u0026rsquos murder by reason of insanityDPP move is on grounds of undue leniency after five-year jail term imposed on farmer Michael FerrisMan wanted in NI over murder of two Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers in EnniskillenEileen Ormsby fractured one of her vertebrae and broke her left wrist in incidentFormer FG councillor Forsey had corruption conviction quashed last month\u0026lsquoClancy Amendment\u0026rsquo allows garda\u0026iacute seize vehicles driven by learner driversScene of fire at KBC bank preserved for examinationDublin city councillor says there\u0026rsquos a duplication of lights from council and Dublin TownGovernment action plan is long on problems posed by a hard Brexit, but short on solutions"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3739538.1545404815!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin s long stone pub to close its door after 264 years","story":"Dan Ryan, manager of the Long Stone pub on Dublin\u0027s Townsend Street, says it is a sad day as the pub closes after 264 years.

Photograph: James FordeThe  .One of Dublin’s oldest pubs is to close its door for the last time this weekend before being demolished as part of a major city centre development. The Long Stone on Townsend Street was established in 1754 and has been a favourite of Trinity College, Dublin students for generations. It takes its name from the long stone that vikings used to signal that they had captured the lands around it. It is being demolished in conjunction with Apollo House to make way for a 11 storey development being built by Marlet, which paid €56 million for the cleared site on which Apollo House stood last month. Adjacent to it, permission has also been given for the demolition of Hawkins House, which was the headquarters of the Department of Health. While those buildings are cited among the ugliest and most disliked in Dublin and no one will lament their passing, the same cannot be said for the Long Stone. The pub will shut its doors on Saturday and its 15 staff dispersed to the other pubs in the Murray group which has owned it for the last 11 years. “We got to know a lot of people around here who were good people,” said manager Dan Ryan. “We knew this day was coming, but when it arrives it is always different. You always feel a bit sad. It’s a pity because it’s been a good busines over a long period of time.“The Long Stone is a unique pub and will be sadly missed by us and our customers. People loved it - locals and tourist alike. The sale and the redevelopment of this block was always on the cards over the last couples of years, and now the that day has arrived.”  Marlet intends to move into the premises in January with a wrecking ball to start its work.

Video: EBS\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney. Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersThe Government published a long-awaited contingency plan to prepare for a no-deal Brexit late on Wednesday evening because, at this late stage, it had to. London and Brussels started publishing theirs months ago, and the business community, which survives on certainty, was clamouring for more information on how to prepare for this potential worst-case scenario. The political stalemate at Westminster makes no-deal planning a major priority with less than 100 days until the UK leaves the EU. In another sign of increasing pessimism on a deal, the UK government was on Thursday found to be editing its own “no-deal” notices to remove the word “unlikely” in relation to a crash-out Brexit. The Government’s contingency plan makes for bleak reading. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney used the words “stark” and “sobering”. The 133-page plan is long on problems created by a hard Brexit but short on solutions on how to deal with it. The report is a work-in-progress or “a living document”, as the Government calls it, to be updated and developed. The Government identifies well over 200 issues, requiring work across 19 sectors. That is a huge volume of work to do for an event that may not happen and which, the Government still hopes, won’t happen. 1. A hard Brexit would be really badAs has been well forewarned, a disorderly UK exit would be extremely challenging and severe for the State. The contingency plan sets out a plethora of north-south and east-west complications covering trade, food, medicines, flights and policing to be managed with Northern Ireland and Britain outside the EU for the first time in 45 years. A no-deal is painted as “an exceptional economic event” requiring “exceptional measures.” There would be an immediate focus on “crisis management and temporary solutions”. Ominously, the report says planning will involve “difficult and significant choices of a practical, strategic and political nature”. 2. There would have to be lots of new legislationThe Government has identified up to 45 pieces of emergency legislation required to manage life with the UK as a “third country” outside the EU and its vast bundle of laws and rules. In theory, the preference might be for a super Brexit Bill to cover it all, but in practice the aim is to winnow it down to as few Bills as possible. Ministers have been asked to identify essential, non-Brexit legislation so schedules can be cleared out for new Brexit-related legislation. Legislative drafters may be extremely busy from mid-January to Brexit Day on March 29th.3. More land must be purchased at Dublin and Rosslare ports The most detail contained in the report is on the plans to increase activity in customs, border inspections and animal health checks. This will require new buildings at Dublin Port and Rosslare to deal with the new non-EU border with Britain and avoid the expected congestion of lorry traffic. The Government is in the process of buying land at both ports. A temporary site has been identified at Dublin Port given the urgency of the task.1. What happens to the Border?A large “to be decided” sign effectively hangs over the future of the Border in a no-deal world. There is nothing in the report about what would happen to the Border. Coveney has said the Government has no contingency plans for a hard border but stressed that it would be “very difficult” to avoid one without a deal. 2. How will things work on the ground?Who knows? There is scant detail on immediate solutions to cope with no deal. There are lots of references to forums, dialogues and consultationco-ordination groups but little about what they are actually planning to do should the UK crash out. The contingency plan still requires a legally operable text around a no-deal scenario. Business lobby group Ibec, other industry bodies and Opposition politicians have called on the Government to provide more information on how people and businesses would manage day-to-day.The Government will start moving from contingency planning to taking actions if the draft Brexit deal looks no closer to being ratified in London by mid-January. Clearly there are questions that the Government still has no answers to. The Cabinet will discuss more planning at the first meeting of the new year on January 3rd. The feeling in the dark will continue in 2019.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

It was reported on Thursday evening that Mr Trump was also considering withdrawing all US troops - currently 14,000 - from Afghanistan.Mr Trump made the announcement of Mr Mattis\u0027s departure via Twitter, praising his service, and saying Mr Mattis was retiring.Yet the four-star general, in his resignation letter, made clear that he was not retiring but rather resigning, because he did not agree with the president\u0027s decisions.In particular, Mr Mattis stressed that he disagreed with Mr Trump\u0027s attitude towards international relations, and the importance of alliances.“One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,” he wrote.“We cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those strong allies.”He pointed out that Nato came to US aid after the September 11 attacks, and noted that the 74-nation coalition to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) was further evidence of the value of multilateralism.Similarly I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours, he added, singling out Russia and China as adversaries.“We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.”Part of the defence secretary\u0026#39s resignation letter to President Donald TrumpMr Mattis resigned after a meeting on Thursday afternoon in which he had “a difference of opinion” with the president, Reuters reported.The defence secretary was said to be particularly concerned about what would happen to the Kurds, were the US to withdraw its troops from Syria.The retired general insisted it was not a “forced resignation”, and said he will step down on February 28, to allow time for a smooth transition before the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff steps down in September.However, the decision of the 40-year military veteran is widely seen as a significant blow to the Trump administration. David Chalian, CNN political director, said: “There are no more grown-ups left in the room.”Jim Mattis was widely respected around the worldNancy Pelosi, the Democrat leader in the House, said she was shocked and shaken by his decision, given that he was a devoted patriot.I\u0027m shaken by what it means for our country, she said, urging all Americans to read his letter and examine what it means.There\u0027s something very wrong with this picture, she said.

Now we need to see exactly what the detail is, before we see what we are doing.” said one British defence source.Gen Sir Nick Carter had said only hours earlier that he believed the Americans were \u0026#34wholeheartedly committed\u0026#34 to the Afghanistan missionThe Afghan presidency tried to brush off the announcement, saying its forces were largely in control of security rather than Americans.But the disclosure was a gift to the Taliban, who earlier this week met US envoys for tentative peace discussions in Abu Dhabi, said one Western official.If you\u0027re the Taliban, Christmas has come early, a senior foreign official in the Afghan capital told AFP.Would you be thinking of a ceasefire if your main opponent has just withdrawn half their troops?The withdrawal of American troops has been the key demand of Taliban envoys, but America has sought a ceasefire, assurances terrorists will not be able to use Afghan territory and discussed having permanent bases.Seventeen years into the Nato-led mission to stabilise Afghanistan, the country continues to see widespread violenceIt was unclear if the withdrawal plan was related to this week\u0027s three-day talks with US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, but it appeared to come with no strings.Mr Trump announced on Wednesday he was pulling out all 2,000-odd US troops fighting in Syria because he claimed they had defeated Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (Isil).Sir Nick, was asked during a visit to Kabul if he was worried Mr Trump would do the same in Afghanistan, where Britain this year nearly doubled its troop presence to 1,000.Mr Trump has long questioned why America is engaged in Afghanistan. America\u0027s longest ever war has seen the country pour vast sums of money into the conflict and still see the Afghan government struggle to control or influence half the country.The US president was last year persuaded by military advisers to pull out only if security got better and in the meantime increased air strikes and troop numbers in a new strategy he vowed would see troops “fight to win”. But the Pentagon has this year admitted the conflict remains a stalemate, while Afghan forces and civilians have seen sharply growing casualties.Diplomats in Kabul have long talked of a \u0027Tweet of Damocles\u0027 hanging over them from Mr Trump, in which he would decide abruptly to change his mind and announced on social media he was pulling out.The US has not consulted us on the withdrawal and today we will start meetings to discuss it, a Western diplomat in Kabul told Reuters.It will take a while and there are some countries who are ready to exit. So they could be the first to leave.Ministry of DefencePlease review our commenting policyBritish grandparents told to choose between siblings in China custody battleGatwick reopens as military equipment is deployed to stop further drone disruption - latest news Ice-filled crater on Mars photographed by European Space AgencyPolice and pro-independence protesters clash in Barcelona as Spanish cabinet meets in Catalan cityComment: Sally Davies is \u0026#39chief nanny\u0026#39 of a state that draws uniquely smug pleasure from lecturing the poorThirty years after the Lockerbie bombing those who lost loved ones are still searching for the truthWinter solstice 2018: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late)What is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Watch Ukrainian MPs punch one another in the face as a fight breaks out in ParliamentInnocence Project victory as students help overturn sex attack conviction of carerWitchcraft moves to the mainstream in America as Christianity declines - and has Trump in its sightsGerman airports on high alert over suspected terror plotPope Francis calls predator priests \u0026#39vicious wolves\u0026#39 and urges them to turn themselves inProfessor installed panic alarm in his office after woman stalked him for over a year, court hearsBBC investigated by Russian watchdog in retaliation for Ofcom RT probe Zizzi and Ask Italian begin using Welsh mozzarella rather than Italian amid fears of food shortages over BrexitOne in five women diagnosed with ovarian cancer too late for treatment, new research shows\u0026#39The Conservatives are on a knife edge\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s biggest news storiesMother fears for well being of climber who survived a 1,500ft fall on Ben Nevis that killed his friendBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/21/TELEMMGLPICT000184099935_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"republican backlash following scathing resignation jim mattis","story":"President Donald Trump and James MattisEven by the standards of the Trump administration, it has been an extraordinary 48 hours, culminating in the resignation of Jim Mattis.The consensus is that the departure of the widely-admired Defence Secretary is a disaster, depriving the administration of one of the few grown-ups in the room.If that were not enough, Trump has fallen out with two of his most vociferous cheerleaders, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and ultra-conservative firebrand columnist Ann Coulter.Graham described the President’s decision to pull out of Syria as a “stain on the honour of the US.” Coulter rounded on him for failing to build his long-promised wall on the southern border.To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

They even export some of it to Italy.Domino\u0027s pizza has been using mozzarella made from Irish and Welsh milk since 2007, and say: Mozzarella used in Irish Domino’s stores is made from Irish milk and mozzarella used in UK Domino’s stores is made from Welsh milk.When the company made the switch, it explained that Welsh mozzarella makes better pizzas as it is made from milk from cows who graze on high-quality grass.Please review our commenting policyBritish grandparents told to choose between siblings in China custody battleGatwick reopens as military equipment is deployed to stop further drone disruption - latest news Ice-filled crater on Mars photographed by European Space AgencyPolice and pro-independence protesters clash in Barcelona as Spanish cabinet meets in Catalan cityComment: Sally Davies is \u0026#39chief nanny\u0026#39 of a state that draws uniquely smug pleasure from lecturing the poorThirty years after the Lockerbie bombing those who lost loved ones are still searching for the truthWinter solstice 2018: Why pagans celebrate the shortest day of the year (a day late)What is the Brexit backstop, and why has it delayed the vote in Parliament?What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?Watch Ukrainian MPs punch one another in the face as a fight breaks out in ParliamentInnocence Project victory as students help overturn sex attack conviction of carerBritain left in dark over US withdrawal from AfghanistanWitchcraft moves to the mainstream in America as Christianity declines - and has Trump in its sightsGerman airports on high alert over suspected terror plotPope Francis calls predator priests \u0026#39vicious wolves\u0026#39 and urges them to turn themselves inProfessor installed panic alarm in his office after woman stalked him for over a year, court hearsBBC investigated by Russian watchdog in retaliation for Ofcom RT probe One in five women diagnosed with ovarian cancer too late for treatment, new research shows\u0026#39The Conservatives are on a knife edge\u0026#39 -  readers react to the week\u0026#39s biggest news storiesMother fears for well being of climber who survived a 1,500ft fall on Ben Nevis that killed his friendBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/04/09/Grammys.jpg","title":"21 savage i am i was stream full tracklist features childish gambino j cole","story":" I Was: Stream the record and see the full tracklist, features and artwork,IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Beyonce\u0026nbspand her representatives\u0026nbsphave not yet addressed the apparent leaks.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But is that reasonable?In 2017 Liam Fox famously claimed that concluding a trade deal with the European Union after Brexit would be the “easiest in human history” because we’d start from a position of already being fully aligned on tariffs and regulation.Such bullishness is notable by its absence now.Indeed, one of the reasons Brexiteers are so alarmed by the Irish “backstop” provision of the Withdrawal Agreement is that even they doubt that there will be a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU in place by January 2021\u0026nbspwhen the transition is supposed to end.But what are the prospects for trade deals between the UK and the rest of the world after Brexit? What deals could we strike with the likes of the China, India, Brazil and other emerging markets?A glance at the International Trade Secretary’s Twitter feed\u0026nbspshows he remains upbeat on such prospects. Is this warranted?The answer is that it will depend\u0026nbspto a significant extent on what sort of trade deal the UK can get with the EU.Brexit is a mess, so why are MPs not postponing their Christmas break?First, other countries are very likely to wait until they see how close we end up to the EU’s single market and the customs union before deciding, as that will impact the costs-benefit calculation of any bilateral UK trade deal for their firms and industries.Second, if we end up closely aligned on customs with the EU that might limit our government’s autonomy to even forge independent trade deals on goods with third countries since we could be imposing the EU’s Common External Tariff.What about services? Well, presuming we’re out of the single market, that would give us more scope for services trade deals. And it’s true that services are a large and growing share of UK total exports.Yet the problem here is that international trade deals in recent years have been essentially about goods, rather than services.Another snag, at least from the perspective of sovereignty-obsessed Brexiteers, is that a service deal worth having would entail some degree of regulatory harmonsation, for instance recognising each others’ professional qualifications. Is that “taking back control”?Associated to that question is immigration. “A big ask of emerging markets when it comes to trade deals is UK visas for their nationals,” says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform.That may not go down well with those Brexiteers who want less immigration from developing countries, not more.\u0026nbspFinally, there’s “gravity” to think about. It’s an empirical reality that countries tend to do more trade with big economies that are closer to them than those that are further away.Even if we did successfully forge goods and services trade deals with lots of emerging market economies the results might well be disappointing to Brexiteers, like Fox, who have assumed big increases in trade flows.It’s for this reason that almost all Brexit modelling exercises, including the Government’s\u0026nbspone, show only a modest gain to UK GDP in the long term from hypothetical post-Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world, with the damage far outweighed by the macroeconomic costs of introducing trade frictions between us and the EU.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Quentin Crisp, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Brigitte Bardot, Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox have all given past speeches.Dyer provided one of the TV highlights of the year\u0026nbspin June when he appeared on ITV’s Good Evening Britain -\u0026nbspas part of a surreal panel also including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and ex-Baywatch star Pamela Anderson – and launched into an impassioned rant against Brexit and former prime minister David Cameron.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Who knows about Brexit? No one has got a fucking clue what Brexit is, yeah.

He’s in Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?\u0026nbspI think he should be held to account for it.\u0026nbspTwat.”In November, Dyer continued his diatribe against the British political class and the “age of food banks”\u0026nbspin The Big Issue.“Theresa May, bless her, just got that job by default,” he told the magazine. “Boris Johnson running around with his stupid haircut, spouting bollocks. Young people look and think: ‘If these are the people running the country, why shouldn’t I just go and loot and riot?’”“Politicians are just floundering around. They have been given this thing called fucking Brexit because of one man. One man. Who we voted in to be our prime minister, who purely for his own ego decided to call a referendum just to get rid of Nigel Farage.“Well, fuck you\u0026nbspCameron, you posh twat. Sorry. It backfired on him, didn’t it? And what does he do? He fucks off. He doesn’t like the way it went and he fucks off.”The Londoner’s plainspeaking on TV and on Twitter has made him a folk hero over the years and his vitriol on Brexit\u0026nbspsaw him become an immediate fixture in Cold War Steve’s satirical photomontages on Twitter, as high an honour as 2018 had to offer.Dyer – who first rose to fame starring in low-budget Cockney gangster films and as host of Danny Dyer’s Deadliest Men -\u0026nbspwill also address American politics in his Christmas Day broadcast, describing Donald Trump as an “absolute melt”. He previously asked his Twitter followers:\u0026nbsp“Is it me or is this geezer completely off his strange-looking nut?”One of his most famous tweets of all concerned events across the pond in 2012:\u0026nbsp“Can’t believe it’s nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the Twin Towers. It still freaks me out to this day.”As for the Queen, his rival for viewing figures on 25 December, Dyer is actually distantly related to her, as we learnt from a memorable 2016 instalment of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are?, which traced his East End roots back to the Tudor epoch and Edward III, a revelation he was stunned by.“I think I’m going to treat myself to a ruff… Just get a massive ruff, just bowl about with it and if anyone questions it then I’ll explain to them why I’m wearing a ruff,” he said, rather touchingly.\u0026nbspWishing the Queen a happy 90th birthday on an episode of ITV’s Celebrity Juice, he said: “You probably ain’t got a clue who I am… Go out tonight and get off your fucking nut. Enjoy yourself!”The author of The World According to Danny Dyer (2015) has done some of his very best work on social media, routinely dishing out deathless wisdom in his signature style: “I hate that early bird. You know, the one who catches the worm. Get back in ya nest ya feathery little mug.”On Christmas, he posted in 2013:\u0026nbsp“Just whacked me tree up. It’s looking slightly camp this year.\u0026nbspCan’t work out how to give it a pair of bollocks.”On pubs:\u0026nbsp”You’re going in for a drink and a laugh with your mates.

One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces.

Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29.

Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes.

And thus did Charles Dickens become the man who invented Christmas as we know it today.\u0026nbspThe great Dickens scholar FG\u0026nbspKitton said so in an essay in 1903, and the great Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens proved it to be true by starring in the 2017 film The Man Who Invented Christmas.Charles Dickens: The man who invented Christmas plagiarised JesusAnd yet, bah, humbug and damn those pesky experts: lots of them disagree.\u0026nbspIndeed, no less an authority than the US university-based Dickens Project now advises: “It is the smart thing to say that Dickens was the man who “invented” Christmas. Show you are smarter by disputing it.” A Christmas Carol\u0026nbspcomplete with John Leech\u0027s illustration of Mr Fezziwig\u0027s ball\u0026nbspIt is true that industrialisation meant fewer people were exposed to the rural squirearchy’s habit of opening their doors to the lower orders and staging grand Christmas celebrations – of the kind seen at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, where Dickens’ grandfather had been the butler, or in the pages of A Christmas Carol, where The Ghost of Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of how much he had enjoyed the dances organised by old Fezziwig.But in 1843, outside the ranks of the aristocracy and aspirant upper middle-class imitators, Christmas was alive and well.\u0026nbspPrevious attempts to kill it had, after all, foundered on the stubborn resistance of “Merrie England”.Puritan MPs may have ordered December 25 to be kept as a fast day in 1644, to avoid giving “liberty to carnal and sensual delights”.\u0026nbspAnd Oliver Cromwell may be famous as the man who banned Christmas.\u0026nbspBut the “rude multitude” broke the head of the major who tried to enforce the “Ordinance for abolishing holy-days” in Canterbury in 1647, and by 1656 MPs meeting in parliament, on Christmas Day, were reduced to wailing: “The people keep up these superstitious observances to your face … We are returning to Popery.”Created with Sketch.15 Christmas films to watch on Netflix  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Christmas Chronicles, a holiday adventure from producer Chris Columbus (“Home Alone”, Harry Potter) and director Clay Kaytis (The Angry Birds Movie), tells the story of sister and brother, Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis), whose Christmas Eve plan to catch Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on camera turns into an unexpected journey that most kids could only dream about.

After A Christmas Carol, people become obsessed with celebrating Christmas.“Before, there were people who were, like Scrooge’s nephew, doing their own family Christmases, but after, suddenly everyone is thinking: ‘We should be doing that.\u0026nbspWhy haven’t we got people coming round and playing blind man’s buff?’“It all starts to get much bigger.”Newspapers began to notice the establishment of “plum pudding clubs” to help less well-heeled Victorians meet the cost of their Christmas dinner, so they too, like the Cratchit family, could hear “the pudding singing in the copper”.\u0026nbspOther clubs helped them buy a goose, maybe even a “prize turkey” as big as the boy asked to fetch it by the reformed Scrooge.And, says Ms Hawksley, fewer employers wanted to look like the unreformed Scrooge: “It became fashionable for people to expect that they could have time off at Christmas.”Nor did Dickens stop at A Christmas Carol.\u0026nbspHe wrote four more Christmas books.\u0026nbspThen in 1850 he brought out the first “Christmas Number” of his newly created magazine Household Words, working with other writers to pack it with stories for the consumption of “the teeming millions”, as Reverend JH\u0026nbspMorgan called the intended readership of the two-penny weekly.He became, as the Morning Chronicle put it, “the chief literary master of the ceremonies for Christmas”.But, Ms Hawksley\u0026nbspemphasises, when he started it all with A Christmas Carol, Dickens had been seeking to do far more than simply become a sidekick to Father Christmas.\u0026nbsp“It was done as a protest,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “Christmas Carol was written from the heart, from Dickens feeling a desperate need to create change.”Gustave ​​Doré (Alamy)These were the “hungry Forties”, a decade when Britain was in the grip of economic depression, when harvests failed and food prices were rising beyond the reach of many on low incomes.\u0026nbspIn May 1843 Dickens had railed against the wealthy attendees of a City of London charity dinner, calling them “sleek, slobbering, bow-paunched, overfed, apoplectic, snorting cattle”.\u0026nbspThey offered a stark contrast to the poverty he was encountering with ever greater frequency on his customary long walks through London.Then in October Dickens was invited to give a fundraising speech at the Athenaeum in Manchester.\u0026nbspThis was the same Manchester where Friedrich Engels was beavering away at what would be published as The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844.\u0026nbspEngels sought to shame the Victorian manufacturing class by documenting the “the misery and grime which form the complement of their wealth”.\u0026nbspHe told of workers living in overcrowded slums complete with “foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement”, forced by “barbarous” employers to “work 30 to 40 hours at a stretch”, with child factory hands dying or being reduced to “a crowd of cripples” before they could reach adulthood.\u0026nbspHe wrote A Christmas Carol in just six weeks.\u0026nbsp“He saw galloping poverty,” explains Ms Hawksley, “And a government doing nothing about it.\u0026nbspHe couldn’t let it continue.\u0026nbspHe was desperate to do something.”Into the mouth of Scrooge, Dickens inserted what, in his Manchester speech, he had called the “cruel absurdities” of the age.\u0026nbspTo the charitable gentleman seeking alms for the poor, Scrooge offers only a reference to the treadmill of the workhouse, which was about the only official social security option then available.When the gentleman suggests the poor would rather die than enter the workhouse, Scrooge answers: “If they would rather die, they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.”The remark comes to haunt Scrooge once the ghosts start arriving, but it wasn’t far off what many thought about the poor being an unconscionable drain on the finite resources of a population that could not keep expanding forever.\u0026nbspIn most of his books, Dickens wanted to shame his readers into doing something,” says Ms Hawksley.\u0026nbsp “What he wants people to realise is that every single person is, like Scrooge, responsible for the poor they are ignoring.“The point about Scrooge’s conversion is not that he buys the most expensive turkey.\u0026nbspIt’s that the turkey will feed a family.“For Dickens, it’s not about diamonds, or going out and buying a load of plastic crap like people do at Christmas today.\u0026nbspIt’s about the fact that buying decent food and giving Bob Cratchit a salary increase will save Tiny Tim from dying.”Nowhere, says Ms Hawksley, is the central message of A Christmas Carol more clearly stated than when the Ghost of Christmas Present shows Scrooge two emaciated children, a boy named Ignorance and a girl called Want.\u0026nbsp“Beware of them both,” the spirit tells Scrooge –\u0026nbspand the reader.\u0026nbsp “But most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.”“Dickens was saying,” explains Ms Hawksley, “that if you let Ignorance and Want grow up like that, they will become the Bill Sykes, the cruel and violent adults, of the future.“Ignorance and Want are, in Dickens’ mind, about the most important characters in the book, the whole message, the whole point of it.”Alston: Poverty UK\u0027s \u0027biggest challenge\u0027 and\u0026nbspMPs are in \u0027state of denial\u0027 about itWhat frustrates her more, however, is that 175 years after Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol, Britain remains blighted by the kind of poverty he was hoping to eradicate.“Dickens was writing about this in 1843,” she says.\u0026nbsp“How in 2018 can we have the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty talking about child poverty in the UK?\u0026nbspHow can there be so many homeless people on the streets of London?“How can I be hearing news stories that Christmas 2018 will be a so-called “bumper year” for the numbers of children suffering in cold houses because people can’t afford to heat their homes?\u0026nbspThere is absolutely no excuse for it when today we have so much more in terms of money, housing and knowledge of sanitation.”How London is living a modern day Christmas CarolWhat does Christmas Carol still mean to us?In the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, after “crying his eyes out” over A Christmas Carol, the author Robert Louis Stevenson, wrote enviously: “Oh, what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these and just filled people’s hearts with pity.”In the 21st century, Dickens\u0027 great-great-great granddaughter is grimly ambivalent about how the work continues to generate similar reactions.\u0026nbsp“Every year,” says Ms Hawksley, “I meet people who have read A Christmas Carol for the first time, who say, ‘I can’t believe how good it is, how it still resonates.’“That’s wonderful in terms of Dickens’ writing, but depressing in terms of society.\u0026nbspIt frustrates me that A Christmas Carol is still so deeply relevant.\u0026nbspIt bothers me that 175 years after Dickens was writing about the children Ignorance and Want, we still have so much child poverty.”“And that,” she says, “Is what would make Dickens spin in his grave.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to

You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.’ William Cook meets the artisan at her Hampstead homeClick to followThe IndependentThe French creative tried to fit her art around business for nearly 30 yearsIn Gainsborough’s House in Sudbury, where Britain’s greatest portrait artist was born and raised, there’s a bust of that great artist which captures his personality as well any painting. His expression is quizzical. There’s a\u0026nbsphint of mischief in his eyes. Seeing it for the first time you might suppose it was made 250 years ago – the result of numerous painstaking sittings. In fact, it was made just a few years ago, by the sculptor Nicole Farhi.Nicole Farhi, sculptor? Wait a minute – I thought she was a fashion designer? Well, yes and no. It’s true that she made her reputation with her chic yet comfy clothes, but although her name remains a byword for casual elegance she’s not involved in fashion anymore. Instead she’s making sculpture now, full-time, and in February she has a new show at Gainsborough’s House, in Suffolk, where her Gainsborough bust has pride of place.I know nothing about fashion, but I liked that Gainsborough bust a lot. It was conscientious and unpretentious. The focus was on the subject not the sculptor, the way such sculptures ought to be. So when my friend Tracy wangled me an invite to Farhi’s Hampstead home, I jumped at the chance to meet her. I wanted to find out if her new career as a sculptor was for real. I wanted to know if that Gainsborough bust was just a one-off.She meets me in the doorway of her Georgian house. You wouldn’t know she’s 72. Her huge mane of wavy hair is as thick and wild as ever. Her eyes are bright. Her skin is clear. She’s dressed simply, in white pumps, blue jeans and a blue jumper. On anyone else her age, these plain clothes would look dowdy. On her, they’re stylish. How does she pull it off? A pointless question, no need to ask. She’s a famous fashion designer, after all.She was also an interior designer – everything from furnishing to kitchenware – and so, as you’d expect, her home is pretty stylish too: lots of brightly coloured drapes lots of paintings on the walls lots of books and classy bric-a-brac, and lots of sculptures too. She shows me a bust she made of a friend, sculpted when he was in deep despair, a face misshapen with pain and grief. “He looked so torn – his wife had left him.”\u0026nbspIt’s a world away from her Gainsborough bust, so discreet and delicate by comparison. I never knew her work had such range. I’m pleasantly surprised. I’m also quite impressed.Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarOf course it’s terribly unfair, as I know all too well. My mother is a sculptor, about the same age as Nicole. She’s been slogging away throughout her life, ever since art school, and has never broken through. Yet no one’s life is easy. Nicole’s fame has opened doors, but those doors would soon close again if the work wasn’t any good. Britons distrust polymaths and are suspicious of second careers. It may be a bit easier for Nicole to get to first base with her sculpture. It may be a lot harder for her to get beyond second base.It’s not as if sculpture is a newfound fancy. She’s been hard at it for over half her life – 37 years. She shows me a small torso, the first sculpture she ever made. As she holds it in her hand she tells me how she came to make it. She’d gone to see the sculptor Jean Gibson, to ask if she could be her pupil. “I’ll only take you if you have something to say – otherwise, it’s a waste of time,”\u0026nbspsaid Jean as\u0026nbspshe handed Nicole a piece of clay. Jean told Nicole to sculpt a torso, there and then. When Nicole had finished, Jean took a good look at it. “I’m taking you on – come back on Wednesday,” she\u0026nbspsaid.Farhi also sculpts hands and torsos (Walter van Dyk)“I went to my car and I burst into tears – I was so emotional,”\u0026nbsprecalls Nicole. “You see a door opening to another world. I’m emotional just to think about it.”\u0026nbspAs she retells the story, her eyes well up with tears.It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to changeNo, this is no passing fad. “It’s like falling in love. You don’t know why. Something happens and your life is going to change.”\u0026nbspFor over 30 years she had to fit her sculpture around fashion, but then in 2012, she walked away. “Now I sculpt every day.”She takes me to her studio, an orangery\u0026nbspin the garden. There are rows and rows of busts in here, of famous friends: Bill Nighy, Judi Dench, Anna Wintour, Wallace Shawn, Stephen Frears… these busts are full of character. She sculpts hands too, and the torsos of voluptuous women, some of which will be shown at the Beaux Arts London gallery in January. “Large women are beautiful – flesh is wonderful!”\u0026nbspshe exclaims.\u0026nbspThese Rubenesque women are a world away from the models she used to work with during her previous career. “It’s about the sensuality of the flesh, the beauty that large women have,”\u0026nbspshe says. “For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybody.”The artist in her orangery-turned-studio (Julian Jans)Discovering sculpture later on in life has made her determined not to waste a moment. “I don’t have 50 years in front of me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I work every single day, but I don’t mind. I’m so happy that I have been able to stop fashion and just sculpt.”\u0026nbspShe loved art from an early age, and used to paint while she was a student, but when she was young she preferred the whirlwind of the fashion world to the isolation of the artist, so she’s philosophical about the time she’s lost.“Maybe I would not have been serious enough as artist then,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Sculpture is a much slower pace. I can take it now. Probably at the age of 20 I could not.”\u0026nbspAfter 40 years in fashion, she relishes her new seclusion. “I don’t miss the world of fashion at all. I’m very happy on my own here.”For me, it’s a complete antidote, obviously, to everything I did before, to work on larger bodies. But it’s also very important for me to show that you expect to see beauty in a slim person, when beauty is in everything and everybodyShe was born in 1946 in Nice, the second of two children. Her parents were Sephardic Jews, immigrants from Turkey. There was no art in her childhood home. “None whatsoever.”\u0026nbspHer father was a gentle man who saw the best in everyone. He sold carpets for a living. “The house was full of rugs.”Her father sounds a bit too nice to be a terribly successful businessman, but she adored him all the same. “My mother always fought with him because she thought he was too kind,”\u0026nbspshe says, “but he was at peace with it – he was a wise man.”\u0026nbspHer relationship with her mother was more fiery, but her mother had more of an artistic sensibility than her father (“my dad never understood what I was doing”) and it was her mother who enabled her to go to Paris to study fashion – her father wanted her to stay at home.One of the reasons she chose to study fashion was because there were no fashion schools close to home. “Nice was a very small town,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I was dreaming of the capital.”\u0026nbspIn Paris, she soon made her mark, not by impressing her tutors but by cold-calling fashion houses, from public telephones in corner cafes, and asking to show them her drawings and designs. For an unknown teenager, that must have taken a lot of confidence, I say. “There was no other way,”\u0026nbspshe replies. “I didn’t think I had anything to lose.”It was in Paris, in 1972, that she met the founder of French Connection, the London fashion retailer Stephen Marks (“a fabulous businessman”). They started working together, became a couple, and had a child together – a daughter, Candice, now a photographic agent in America.‘Flesh is wonderful,’ Farhi says of her subjects (Walter van Dyk)For a few years, Nicole remained in Paris with Candice, but eventually, she decided it would be best for Candice to go to school in Britain, so when Candice was four she brought her to London.She’s lived here ever since, but she still feels French rather than British (she still speaks with a strong French accent) and the clothes that she designed brought a continental flair to British fashion. Yet she had no game plan, no grand design.She was simply doing what came naturally. “I only did what I felt was right for me. I designed looser clothes because that’s what I liked wearing. I didn’t do very short dresses, because I didn’t think that was nice, to look at a girl and only see the thighs – when she’s dressed, of course. When she’s naked it’s a different thing!”Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi sculptures – in pictures  Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working, 2016Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Homage to Eduardo Paolozzi, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Bill Nighy, 2014 Nicole Farhi in her studio working on Principal Dancer, 2016 What was it like working with the father of her only child? “It was good and bad because we argued a lot at work,”\u0026nbspshe says. “We were fighting a lot.”\u0026nbspIn the end, they separated, but they kept on working together. “And then things changed completely. We had the best relationship working together once we were not living together, and now we’re still very, very close friends. We had a lot of respect for each other, which we never lost. I think he helped me tremendously at becoming who I was.”\u0026nbspThey’re still close today.In 1992 Nicole married the playwright David Hare, with whom she shares this splendid house. It sounds like love at first sight, and, from the way she talks about him, it sounds as if their love has never faded. Yet they might so easily have never met. Nicole had designed some costumes for Hare’s play, Murmuring Judges, and was invited to the first night party. Yet she had no intention of going until she saw Hare on TV the night before. “He went straight to my heart!”\u0026nbspshe says. Entranced and intrigued, she went to the party, and he made a beeline for her table. “It was the same for him!”The artist working on a bust of Bill Nighy, just one of her famous friends (Julian Jans)“You should have started earlier,”\u0026nbspHare said when he saw her sculptures. Maybe she should have met him earlier, too. When she was a fashion student in Paris, Hare was studying at the Sorbonne. They both used to skip classes to go to the movies, at the same cinemas, and yet their paths never crossed. “We could have been younger, had kids together,”\u0026nbspshe muses. Yet, as she says, quite rightly, there’s no point in crying over what you’ve missed.While Nicole sculpts in the orangery, David writes in his own studio just down the road. For two creative artists in their early 70s, it sounds like an idyllic life. “We don’t meet during the day – he doesn’t come home for lunch,” she says. But they’re obviously besotted with each other. Clearly, a little absence makes the heart grow fonder as the years ebb away.Artist uses robots to create stunning \u0027classical\u0027 sculptures16th century Spanish sculpture hit with botched restoration attemptChristo\u0027s latest sculpture weighs 600 tons (and it floats)Controversial uterus sculptures by Damien Hirst unveiled in QatarFor the last seven years, they’ve shared the house with Nicole’s mother, who moved in with them at the grand old age of 95. For Nicole, it was a poignant epilogue to a long and turbulent relationship. “She did tell me, perhaps for the first time in her life, when she was 101, that she loved me,”\u0026nbspshe says. “Because we fought so much, I was never sure.”\u0026nbspShe died six months ago, aged 102. Nicole shows me the bust she made of her, looking feisty and defiant, but the sculpture that really moves me is of her frail little hand, cast when she was 100.Stephen Marks sold the Nicole Farhi label in 2010. Nicole carried on working there, but it was never quite the same. She left a couple of years later. “I hoped one day I would stop, but I had no idea when that would be. It was only when my company was sold that I realised that was my way out.”\u0026nbspFor her, it was a liberation. When Nicole Farhi went into administration the following year she felt oddly detached from the brand that still bears her name. “It was not upsetting at all,”\u0026nbspshe says. “I could not wait to leave.”No matter. Sculpture is what she does now, and she’s determined not to look back. As she shows me out, she stops to show me the bust of her friend and mentor, the great Italian-Scottish sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. “He opened my eyes to everything,”\u0026nbspshe tells me, as we say goodbye. It’s a supremely expressive sculpture, full of life and love and suffering. There are several others I like a lot, but for me, this is the pick of the bunch. Before I met her, I couldn’t quite understand why she’d turned her back on fashion, but now I know she was right to do so. Nicole Farhi used to be a brilliant fashion designer, but that was then and this is now. She’s a proper sculptor now.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All fluorescent pinks and greens, completely untouched. He bought it in and put it down carefully next to his chair. Then he said ‘That\u0027s all that I can find of my family’”.After turning to drugs and drink, David died of heart failure in a cheap hostel in Thailand on 29 December 1993, eight days after the fifth anniversary of Lockerbie.Steven became known as “the orphan of Lockerbie”.\u0026nbsp When he died after an accident on a railway line in August 2000, he was described as the tragedy’s last fatality.Far away from Lockerbie, in the English Cotswolds, Dr Jim Swire was at home with his wife Jane.\u0026nbsp They knew their 23-year-old daughter Flora, a neurology PhD student, had booked a last-minute flight to spend Christmas in the US with her boyfriend.Jim was in the study when Jane called to him: “You must come and watch the Nine O’Clock News because there’s been this plane that’s gone down.”Jim had to identify his daughter from the mole on her toe.Grief turned this Eton and Cambridge-educated doctor into a tireless campaigner.\u0026nbspThen 52, he became arguably the face of those grieving for the 43 Britons killed in the atrocity.\u0026nbsp (Lockerbie claimed the lives of people from 21 different nations, including 190 Americans.)Dr Swire lobbied constantly, appealing to the United Nations, exposing the continuing gaps in airport security by smuggling a case of marzipan, which has the same density and appearance as Semtex, onto a transatlantic flight.It still took nearly 12 years before the trial of two Libyan suspects began on May 3 2000, at a specially convened tribunal, operating under Scottish law and heard by three Scottish judges without a jury, at Camp Zeist, the Netherlands.The tortuous road to trial included the imposition of sanctions on Colonel Gaddafi’s Libya, suggestions the international consensus on sanctions was collapsing, and lengthy secret negotiations between the UK, US and the Netherlands, initiated by Tony Blair’s foreign secretary Robin Cook.The investigation that put Megrahi and alleged accomplice Lamin Khalifa Fhimah in the frame had involved interviewing 15,000 people and examining 180,000 pieces of evidence.When the trial began in the Netherlands, Dr Swire was convinced both men were guilty.By the time the judges acquitted Fhimah and found Megrahi guilty on 31 January 2001, Dr Swire was convinced that the only man convicted was innocent.\u0026nbspAbdelbaset\u0026nbspal-Megrahi: the only man ever convicted of involvement in the Lockerbie bombing (Crown OfficePA Wire)He befriended Megrahi, visiting him, exchanging Christmas cards, becoming relentless in his efforts to clear the Libyan’s name, and thus to find his daughter’s ‘real killers’.He had sat through the whole trial, seen for himself some of its more puzzling incidents.Dr Swire had registered the bewilderment of Pierre Salinger, former chief foreign correspondent for America’s ABC network, when the judges thanked him for his evidence and asked him to leave the witness box.That\u0027s all?” asked Salinger, who had interviewed the two suspects.\u0026nbsp “Wait a minute.\u0026nbsp You\u0027re not letting me tell the truth.\u0026nbsp I know who did it. I know how it was done.Lord Sutherland, one of the judges coolly informed him: If you wish to make a point you may do so elsewhere, but I\u0027m afraid you may not do so in this court.The Scottish Crown Office - backed it should be said by many American victims\u0027 families - remains sure Megrahi was a Libyan agent, a key player in a plot where an unwitting Air Malta worker checked the Samsonite onto a Frankfurt-bound flight as a favour for a “friend” in Germany, where the suitcase was routed to Heathrow, then loaded on to Pan Am 103.Tony Gauci, whose shop Mary’s House was near Malta’s airport, identified Megrahi\u0026nbspas the man who bought clothes from him that were later found to have been packed into the Samsonite, concealing the bomb.But there were reports of large undisclosed payments going from the US Justice Department to Mr Gauci.Created with Sketch. Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The suspicion was growing that, either by accident or cover-up, Megrahi had become the innocent fall guy who got a life sentence for mass murder.The Libyan was described, by The Independent among others, as less secret agent and more “Tripoli airport control manager briefly assigned to Libyan intelligence for bureaucratic rather than specialist tradecraft reasons.”Many came to believe the Lockerbie atrocity was the work of Palestinian militants, with suspicion falling in particular on the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front (PPSF) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC).The trial, for example, had heard evidence from FBI agent Edward Marshman that Jordanian bomb maker Marwan Khreesat told him he had supplied the PFLP-GC with explosive devices similar to the one used to down Pan Am 103.By contrast there was considerable scepticism about the prosecution’s attempts to link Libya’s intelligence services to the improvised explosive device that destroyed the jet.A fingernail-sized fragment of circuit board found in the wreckage was identified by prosecutors as being part of a timer made by contractor Thuring and sold by Swiss company Mebo to the Libyan armed forces.But sceptics said independent analysis of the timer fragment showed it had a pure tin coating, whereas Thuring devices were covered in a tin-lead alloy.Dr Swire came to disbelieve the official story of a bomb going from Malta to Frankfurt to London, thinking instead that the bomb had been smuggled through Heathrow and only ever travelled on one aeroplane: Pan Am 103.One Heathrow staff member reportedly told police in January 1989 that he had seen a hard-shell Samsonite in a luggage container heading for the Boeing 747’s hold before the Frankfurt feeder flight that was supposed to have carried the bomb had even landed at the London airport.Some accounts were prepared to accept that Libyan money might have helped fund the Palestinian militants – the US bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 certainly gave Gaddafi plenty of motive for becoming (or continuing as) a terrorist paymaster.But the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by a missile fired in error from a US warship in July 1988 gave another Middle East government a far more recent grievance, one that would have made targeting American civilian air passengers particularly appealing.Whatever the truth, the conflicting accounts and the seeming entanglement with Middle Eastern intrigue left many with the sense that Lockerbie had become a decidedly murky affair.And then, in 2009, things acquired a whole new layer of murkiness.\u0026nbsp Megrahi was released from Greenock prison on compassionate grounds and allowed to return home to Libya.Abdelbaset al-Megrahi died two years and nine months after being released from prison in Scotland on compassionate grounds (Reuters)As the release was sanctioned by Kenny MacAskill, justice secretary in the SNP administration in Edinburgh, officials let it be known that Megrahi was dying from cancer and had only about three months to live.Rather awkwardly for the UK and Scottish administrations, he lived for nearly three more years, dying in Tripoli in May 2012 aged 60.Both the Westminster and Edinburgh governments insisted the release decision had been based purely on the interests of justice, with international power politics having nothing to do with it.But this was happening in the honeymoon period after Tony Blair’s 2004 ‘Deal in the Desert’, sealed with a handshake in Gaddafi’s tent, helping to end sanctions against Libya, while delivering billion-dollar contracts for Western oil companies.A US Senators’ report would later suggest that oil giant BP had lobbied for a prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and Libya. \u0026nbspBoth the oil company and the British government denied that the discussions had specifically mentioned Megrahi.\u0026nbsp At the time of his release, however, one Whitehall source had told The Independent: “It was clear this case is very, very important to the Libyans.”And then the honeymoon with Gaddafi was ended by the Libyan revolution of 2011.\u0026nbsp He went back to being a pariah, the UK joined a bombing campaign against him, and the rebels finished him off after dragging him from a drainage pipe near Sirte.And if anything, the intrigue around Lockerbie deepened.Why, for example, was Colonel Gaddafi’s former spy chief Moussa Koussa, who fled to London during the revolution, allowed to fly on to Qatar after just three days?Andrew MacKinlay, a former Labour MP and member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, remembered meeting Mr Koussa in Tripoli in 2005 and being told by a British diplomat: “This man is up to his neck in Lockerbie”.Mr Koussa remains safely ensconced in Qatar, although he was eventually asked to leave his luxury suite in the Doha Four Seasons.In 2015 Scottish prosecutors effectively re-opened the Lockerbie investigation by naming two Libyans they wanted to talk to: Abdullah al-Senussi, Gaddaffi’s brother-in-law and formerly a senior Libyan intelligence official, and Abu Agila Masud, a man believed to have bomb-making skills.Both men are in jail in Libya.\u0026nbsp Scottish and American prosecutors are said to be hopeful they will be allowed, despite the chaos now bedevilling Libya, to talk to the two suspects.\u0026nbspA report in this week’s Times suggested prosecutors were “closing in” on their two targets.\u0026nbsp The response from the Libyan government – or at least the UN-backed version of it – was said to have been “positive and constructive”.Megrahi’s family, meanwhile, has launched a fresh appeal against his conviction to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC).When he died in 2012, his brother Abdulhakim said: “Just because Abdulbaset is dead doesn’t mean the past is now erased.\u0026nbsp We will always tell the world my brother was innocent.”For his part, Dr Swire described the death of his friend as “a very sad event”.\u0026nbsp He praised the way that Megrahi, even when dying and in great pain, had sought to pass on the information amassed by his defence team.Dr Swire himself is now 82.Thirty years on from being called from his study to watch a TV news bulletin that changed his life, he is still searching for simple, undisputed truth about what happened to his daughter and 269 others.Given what we now know about Lockerbie, it seems rash to assume that anyone will ever find

There are a variety of options, but all have serious problems and would be unlikely to keep everyone happy.Here are the main possibilities – and what’s wrong with them all.The most obvious option is to rerun the 2016 EU referendum question and simply ask people whether they want to remain in the European Union or leave it.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut this question repeats the same mistakes as the last vote: what does “leave” actually mean? The government is currently in deadlock and the referendum is supposed to let the people decide,\u0026nbspbut this question simply doesn’t solve the problem the government is facing. If Leave wins again, we’re back to square one. As a result, it’s unlikely to be asked.\u0026nbspRemain vs Theresa May’s deal vs no dealSplitting out no deal and May’s deal seems to be a logical response to the problems with the last question. Voters would be able to choose between any of the three options.But this would split the Leave vote, leaving Remain to almost certainly win. Most unsustainably, it could even produce a Remain win when the majority of people actually vote for Leave options. Democratically, this is a non-starter\u0026nbspand would reasonably be seen as a stitch-up.‘Do you approve of the Brexit deal negotiated by the government?’The government could simply ask voters to approve or reject the Brexit deal. This suffers from similar problems as the first question: if the deal is rejected, what happens? Do we leave with no deal? Or remain?\u0026nbspIt might prove attractive as a roll of the dice for a government trying to ram through the deal without its MPs – or then again it might not\u0026nbspbecause the public would probably vote it down, according to current polls. This also has no ‘remain’ option so would surely disappoint the main people who want a second referendum – remain voters.One proposal is to ask the questions in two rounds: first, whether voters accept or reject the deal. Then, if it’s rejected, whether they want to remain or leave without a deal.\u0026nbspYou could also ask the questions in a different order if you wanted – leave vs remain first, and then pick between no deal and Therea May’s deal if it’s a Leave vote. But whatever order you ask the questions in, there is a fundamental issue here.Is it really a good idea to put no deal on the ballot paper, and risk giving the government an explicit binding mandate to create food and medicine shortages?\u0026nbspCurrently, parliament can stop a no deal and credibly claim it isn’t what people voted for. But holding this referendum puts economic catastrophe back on the table and could make the situation infinitely worse – which raises the question of why you would want to hold it at all.\u0026nbspPolling suggests that no deal is more popular than May’s deal – it is not impossible that it could win, given voters chose Leave last time.\u0026nbspThis no-deal problem\u0026nbspis a thread that runs through many second referendum options. Explicitly putting it on the ballot paper is probably not a good idea. But not putting it on the ballot paper doesn’t solve the problem.You could ask the three-way question and give\u0026nbspvoters the options of\u0026nbspranking the options, then tally them up using\u0026nbspan alternative vote\u0026nbsp(AV). This is practically the same as two-round voting and has the same problem – no deal is on the ballot.There are also extra problems, such as the fact that AV can produce some quite unintuitive results – and the fact that the system was explicitly rejected for parliamentary elections at a referendum in 2011, so its use would certainly be contested.This is the option favoured by the People’s Vote campaign. In some ways it is the least worst: it rules out no deal. Remainers will like it because it offers them the option of staying. It is also explicit about what each option means, so it solves the deadlock.But it runs the risk of being seen as illegitimate: the fact remains that a not insignificant number of people are actively campaigning for leaving on World Trade Organisation terms without a deal. Many Brexiteers say they see Theresa May’s deal as “no Brexit at all”. They would consider this question a betrayal – forced to choose between two things they don’t want, despite having won the first vote.There is also the question of political deliverability. The country has a Tory government, and if there are two things that the vast majority of Tory MPs don’t want to vote for, they are: Remain, and Theresa May’s deal. So why would they pass a referendum that forces them to choose between two options they hate?Any question with ‘negotiate a different deal’ or ‘Norway’ as an optionThe EU has said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, so putting it as an option in a referendum would be meaningless. If it was voted for the government would be stuck.Similarly, suggestions that a soft Brexit like the Norway option\u0026nbsp(entry into the European Economic Area) or similar could be on the ballot papers misunderstand the situation. The government needs to pass the withdrawal agreement before April or extend or revoke Article 50. Having a referendum on the future relationship is fine, but it wouldn’t solve the problem\u0026nbspand isn’t an alternative to working out what to do with the withdrawal agreement.So in summary…You either risk causing an economic catastrophe by putting no deal on the ballot paper, you exclude no deal as an option and risk the referendum being seen as illegitimate by the people who won last time, or you don’t solve the actual dilemma the government is currently facing.\u0026nbspThat isn’t to take away from the compelling case for a Final Say referendum, which The Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for at length\u0026nbspand collected more than a million signatures in favour of. Done right, another vote\u0026nbspcould solve the UK’s political deadlock, check whether the public still want to leave, and spell out what’s really on offer. But if one is called, the question will have to be chosen carefully, with an awareness of the tradeoffs.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Like it or loathe it, Vladimir Putin’s annual press-conference generally creates headlines.\u0026nbspThe 14th edition of this carefully-managed show was no exception, with Putin unexpectedly throwing his weight behind Theresa May’s Brexit plans.\u0026nbsp“The referendum happened,” he said. “What can she do? She should fulfil the will of her nation, as expressed at the referendum. Or it isn’t a referendum.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free readStart your free trialStart your free trialWithout the adsStart your free trialThe Kremlin has been accused of attempting to influence the initial Brexit vote, but that did not deter the Russian president from warning against a second vote.\u0026nbspNot to implement Brexit now would be to repudiate “direct democracy”, he said, adding: “Is it democracy not to care about this Brexit and continue voting until someone is happy with the result?”Overall, Putin presented little in the way of a new agenda. As in previous episodes of the marathon conference, he declared that Russia’s economy was\u0026nbspresilient, the outside world was aggressive, Ukraine was\u0026nbspblinkering on collapse, and his watch would eventually deliver a “technological breakthrough”.\u0026nbspYes, things weren’t always great, he said, but they had been worse. Ten years ago, in the midst of crisis, there was negative growth!\u0026nbspSanctions? What of them? Russia has faced sanctions throughout history. This time, Russia was more than coping. It was the west that was\u0026nbspreally losing.\u0026nbsp“Just look at Spain! They have 15 per cent\u0026nbspunemployment while we have 3.8 per cent!”And what of the disease-ridden landfill sites that have so enraged working class Russians in recent months? Russia would build new recycling plants –\u0026nbspbut remember there are “entire islands of rubbish in the Pacific Ocean.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAt times, it almost seemed that\u0026nbspPutin was bored and irritated with the format. He only really became engaged when talking about nuclear weapons.\u0026nbspHe repeated promises to build Russia’s strategic arsenal. This, he said, was a response to the US decision to withdraw from the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, and their apparent intention not to renew another cold war arms treaty.“The risks of a nuclear war are growing and underestimated,” he said. “People shouldn’t squeak when we try to add capacity. We aren’t adding capacity, we are preserving balance.”\u0026nbspWeary Putin complains about lack of political competitionOn the main metric of the yearly show – the number of hours journalists are kept inside without food or water – this year fell somewhat short of the record. The press conference lasted just under 4 hours, or 50 minutes short of the 2008 show. \u0026nbspBut it was a record on the attendance count, with 1,700 journalists packed inside the hall. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov made a point of declaring that his staff had gone out of their way to assist foreign journalists in accreditation — unlike the British, he said, who were causing trouble for RT.\u0026nbspOnly those with a criminal record, or “with various illnesses” had been denied accreditation, Peskov said.\u0026nbspAccreditation was not, however, an automatic guarantee of entry. At least one journalist was turned away at the doors of the hall despite possessing the golden hologrammed card. In Roman Dobrokhotov’s case, the crime of identifying the two GRU agents accused of the Skripal poisoning seems to have played against him.\u0026nbspOne affliction that certainly did not bar entry to the hall was\u0026nbspPutinmania.\u0026nbspThroughout the event, journalists were encouraged to shriek to gain the main man’s attention. Some came in fancy dress to stand out (think hockey gear, snow maiden outfits and regional costume). Others bore placards with the name of their region, publication or something more abstract (for example,\u0026nbsp“I’m from the future. Ask me what it’s like there”).\u0026nbspAlmost on cue, they applauded the president, booed\u0026nbspany question that could be deemed too hostile, and lobbed in their own softballs.\u0026nbspSome of the zingers served up today included an offer to go skiing, a long-winded New Year’s\u0026nbspgreeting, and a simple “how are you feeling?”\u0026nbspAs usual, the most interesting questions were the ones that went unanswered and unasked.\u0026nbspThe president sidestepped a question about the role of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a shady associate accused of creating troll farms and private armies, and who has been nicknamed the “president’s chef” on account of his propensity to win state catering contracts.\u0026nbspCabinet splits laid bare as Rudd says new referendum is ‘plausible’“My only cooks are employees of the presidential security service,” the president said.Putin then whataboutised the deaths of three journalists in the Central African Republic, ignoring questions about Prigozhin’s alleged role in the affair. “Journalists are killed in Ukraine too,” he said.\u0026nbspAnd there was certainly no mention about what happened to the two men Putin personally presented as “ordinary Russian citizens”, but later identified as military intelligence agents Anatoly Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They then hope thatPM’s Brexit agreement is voted down, Parliament can then agree on a Plan B – such as a Norway-style exit.Ms Morgan told The Sun: “This is the start of Parliament making clear through amendments that we are not going to have a No Deal.”The Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has said they would start seeking a second referendum.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.In September , Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.Labours official position is that it would vote against any deal struck by Theresa May with the aim of pushing for a General Election.Speaking on BBCs Andrew Marr Show, Starmer said: “If there’s no deal brought back or the deal is voted down, then other options are on the table, one of which is a public vote.“And in that public vote no options are ruled out, including the option of remain.On November  former PM Tony Blair insisted Jeremy Corbyn is likely to start backing a second EU referendum in the near future.After May won her leadership battle on December , Corbyn tweeted: Tonights vote changes nothing.Theresa May has lost her majority in Parliament, her Government is in chaos and shes unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first.She must now bring her botched deal back to Parliament next week.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it would be inevitable another EU referendum would be calledLabour are not able to force a general election.He told the BBC forcing an election would be very dficult andthat was not possible, Labour would push for another referendum.In December, Bet was offering   that there would be another referendum by the end of , and   there would not.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed  per cent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while  per cent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview  was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.On November , , it was reported that the majority of voters in all seats held by Labour support a second referendum on Brexit.The findings were according to an analysis released by the People’s Vote campaign from a YouGov poll of , people.On December , , a Sky Data poll revealed that over halfof Britons would support a referendum between Mays Brexit deal, no deal, and staying in the EU.The Prime Minister was determined to persuade MPs to back the deal in a Parliamentary vote on December  .But when success seemed so unlikely that she pulled the vote, it is now unclear what will happen next.One potential course of events would involve the vote ing to the Commons by the end of January.If she then fails to secure the votes required then a second Brexit referendum could be on the table.The SNP have said they would back a so-called Peoples Vote and a number of Conservative MPs have also backed one.So there could be a majority in Parliament for it but a second referendum will not happen quickly and the first stage is for there to be an Act of Parliament.That will require the backing of a majority of MPs and it took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in .Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February , and the vote taking place on  June.But the Electoral Commission has said in future there should be at least a six-month gap to allow enough time to register campaigns and put counting officers in place.There is also the question of what to do about Article .Britain could vote to remain in the EU, but have already left by the time the vote was held.This could be avoidedthe EU agreed to extend the Article  deadline - but that would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.Then there is the question of what to put on the ballot paper.If there are three questions - for example accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU or leave with no deal - then just  per cent could decide the winning option.The first referendum on EU membership took place in .Two-thirds of votersbacked the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in .In the summer of , Britain voted to leave the EU after .million people backed Leave compared to .million Remain voters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000247427949.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"trevor kavanagh no deal full british brexit leave","story":"Asked by a major pro-Brexit industrialist how Brussels might respond, I am told a rattled German official replied: “We would re-open negotiations immediately.”Yesterday, Jeremy Hunt broke cover as the first senior minister to publicly back a Full British Brexit — precisely what .million voters ordered more than two years ago.“I’ve always thought even in a No-Deal situation that this is a great country,” he said. “We’ll find a way to flourish and prosper. We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year.

It’s a Remainer ruse. Except it’s worse than remaining. Norway Plus, aka “Remain Minus”, would destroy the Tories as surely as simply scrapping Brexit.It is far more likely to do so than any number of “no-confidence” stunts like the one Jeremy Corbyn has now pulled in his pathetic desperation for relevance.If Theresa May’s withdrawal deal fails — and Remainer Cabinet ministers would rather sacrice Brexit than swallow a No Deal — they’ll just have to quit.It’s not much of a threat.

And some reality TV stars set a good example, just as some of our more traditional public figures leave a lot to be desired.It seemed to me that Love Island winners Jack and Dani were quite a moral couple. They acted with integrity, which is a really good message for young people.But contrast this with US President Donald Trump — I’ve spoken to girls in an assembly about lewd com-ments he has made and how they fit with his role of Leader of the Free World.More recently, we’ve seen Harry Redknapp triumph in I’m A Celebrity — and he came across as a loving, loyal man who represents an image of masculinity that sometimes we don’t see.So never mind politicians,you want to present an argument for decency, sometimes you’re better off getting a healthy dose of reality TV.THE incoming head of the Girls’ Schools Association, Sue Hincks, says reality TV stars are better role models for schoolchildren than politicians.Is she right  As evidence she offered ’s Love Island and I’m A Celebrity.It’s true that this year’s winners — Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham in Love Island, and Harry Redknapp in I’m A Celeb — were adorable.But it’s easy to look brave when you are wearing a helmet full of insects, especiallyyour background is in musical theatre, like campmate John Barrowman.I’d try to remember I was comparing reality TV stars to Donald Trump, who, though incidentally President of the United States and a politician, is still, and always will be, a reality TV star. He just has more cameras these days.But then I look at the current state of British politicians and it’s hard not to agree with Hincks.At least on reality TV the contestants try to disguise their moral failings, becausethey didn’t, no one would vote for them.This isn’t a problem for politicians, because on any given day the other side are behaving worse.I long for the calm wisdom of ’Arry and the open-hearted kindness of Dani — I’m sure she would be fine, with a strong Cabinet secretary behind her, telling her the dference between the deficit and the debt. Perhaps the new crop of “wholesome” reality TV stars is a response to our politicians, a cry of the heart from the electorate: “We just want someone kind!”Look at Boris Johnson, and his new haircut for the leadership contest that never came. What did he tell his barber  “Don’t make me look like a flatulent, floppy-haired former public schoolboy” When did anyone last call BJ kind Or at David Davis, who pitched for the Tory leadership in  with the catchphrase “It’s DD for me”. That’s not a campaign slogan, it’s a bra cup size.Look at the younger Tories, seething with ambition, bungee jumping over the corpses of rivals with lattes in their hands.The horrible irony is, they would bite their own fingers off for a chance to appear on Strictly Come Dancing.On the other side we have a Labour leadership juddering with cowardice, longing for a hard Brexit — while lying about it — and a swt General Election, like the bourgeois Trots they are. If it’s bad for the people, it’s good for them. Yuk.So Hincks isn’t wrong to make a comparison which even five years ago would have seemed obscene.Can it be that reality TV stars are the best of us, and reality TV is now more authentic than actual real le If true — and it seems to be — things are bad indeed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such a move, he added, would help those most at risk from a No Deal Brexit “to boost them as they transition”.We’re told in a doomsday No Deal ­scenario that all planes will be grounded and the country will be sold no medicines from abroad.It’s even claimed that our food exports will rot in lorries queued up at Dover, while we starve because no food is being imported via Calais, both of which seem unlikely to happen at the same time.To listen to some campaigners, you’d think there are only three kinds of ­relationship with the EU: Membership, paying the massive bills and swallowing endless laws from Brussels a big, one-size-fits-all deal or a smouldering ruin, cut off completely from trade or co-operation.It might be in their interests to pretend so, because they want to try to frighten us into accepting a poor deal or scare us into abandoning the idea of taking back control altogether. But it isn’t true.Most of the world aren’t EU members, after all, and many countries don’t have trade deals with the EU.Brussels’ rule-by-committee means that trade negotiations with the bloc are slow and have to satisfy a dizzying list of ­special interests.Of the deals that countries have struck with the EU,  dferent types have been hammered out.Anyone who claims there is no flexibility in how we manage our relationship after Brexit is not telling the whole story.But even beyond that, among the many countries who trade with the EU without a deal, the reality does not match up to the black-and-white claim that the choice is either full deal or No Deal.In real le, most countries are quite practical and have the power to reach a whole range of smaller agreements with one another that fall short of a trade deal but still bring benefits.They recognise each other’s driving licences or doctors’ qualications, allow mutual access to their air space, or agree to trust each other’s safety tests on goods rather than hold them up for costly extra testing at their ports.Why do they do it  Because it is in both sides’ interests for trade, tourism and le in general to flow as easily as possible.The US does it, the EU does it, every normal state does it — and there’s no ­reason why we and the EU couldn’t do it, too,it isn’t possible to reach a larger agreement for le after Brexit right now.As Theresa May is finding out, some issues might simply be too dficult or controversial for the UK or the EU to give ground on in the next few weeks.But that should not stop us from ­shaking hands on hundreds of other side deals that both sides could agree quite simply, and which would help both sides to square away.That’s what’s called a “managed no deal” — it might not be either our or their dream outcome but it would make le easier while work continues on overcoming the really dficult sticking points.What’s shocking is the way in which this practical approach has been widely ignored for political reasons.Some of the much-touted “worst-case scenario” forecasts for the supposed cost of Brexit rely on the ridiculous assumption that Brussels and Westminster would do literally nothing to reduce any potential problems from No Deal.We’ve been told repeatedly from some quarters that it is simply impossible for the EU to show any flexibility at all with a non-member, even though it has done so in ious cases.At long last, that lie is being exposed. Just as the UK has released its No Deal preparations, the EU is this week ­publishing details of how it would ­handle that situation.And guess what  Brussels wants to strike mutual side deals in which we both agree to respect ious aspects of each other’s rights in order to limit ­disruption and costs.It turns out there is a practical way ­forward after all, and the doom-mongers’ predictions should be taken with a hefty fistful of salt.Of course a good, wide-ranging, lasting deal is still desirable, and we should keep working to agree one.But there are things we can and should do in the meantime.Better that than be rushed into a ­permanent bad deal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would seem they agree about nothing. As soon as one minister says something another clown will jump up and insist he’s wrong.It’s like being led by a bunch of hyperactive five-year-olds. If it wasn’t for the fact that the leader of the opposition is a cross between Catweazel and Trotsky we’d have got rid of them long ago.This time the argument is about immigration. The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has said there are no targets for reducing immigration. The PM immediately responded: “Oh yes there are, baldie.”For once, Theresa May is right. Immigration is a crucial issue and we have been promised time and again — by May herself — that it will be drastically reduced. That’s what the vast majority of the country wants. And the only sensible way to do it is by having targets. You know, something to aim at.We’ve put up with a lot from this Government, maybe too much. If they start backsliding on immigration, that will be it. Down to tens of thousands of people per year, please, as soon as possible. Uncontrolled immigration has made this country almost unrecognisable.We still need to import some talent from overseas. People with good skills and high qualications. What we don’t need are thousands of beggars shoving badly scrawled messages in your face saying “Money Give Now” on the Tube.Nor do we need the thousand upon thousand of unskilled workers picking fruit and veg. Here’s a tip, farmers — pay a decent wage and maybe a few British people will give those jobs a go, huh British businesses have exploited cheap foreign labour for far too long. And the result is an underclass of Eastern Europeans living in desperately squalid conditions, in appalling accommodation.It’s not THEIR fault, by any means. It’s the fault of an immoral system which has seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.Cheap EU labour has meant that the wages of the very poorest Britons get undercut. Why on earth the Labour Party supports this exploitation is a total mystery to me.But the other real problem we have is immigration from outside the EU. This easily outnumbers those coming from Europe. I don’t just mean those who say they are refugees but are clearly economic migrants. Although Theresa May could do worse than pledge a halt to that influx, which continues.But we still let in thousands of people from all over the world. They come claiming their brother or cousin lives here and that should give them a right to our benefits and jobs.This has been going on for too long. And it is this immigration which has most changed the face of Britain, in a way many people resent.Here’s the deal, Theresa. Look at Belgium, where the government has just fallen because it ignored the country’s wishes on immigration. So get tough. Put Mr Javid back in his box and set a few realistic targets. Then get to grips with immigration full stop.

Our original design of the system was for a rate of  percent. The Government has already brought it down from  percent to  percent and it should go further.Likewise, the call for childcare support is welcome and mirrors ideas from the Centre for Social Justice.Childcare can be complex and expensive to navigate – anything that makes it more affordable and simpler is welcome.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. For the aim of Universal Credit is to simply six dferent benefits into one single claim. It lets them keep more of the money they earn. And, crucially, it gives claimants a single work coach to guide them through the process.When fully rolled out, best estimates are that Universal Credit will help between , and , more people into work, those already in work to earn more, and those in part-time work will to move to full-time.And with two-thirds of people coming onto Universal Credit bringing signicant debt with them, it shows the deeply ingrained problems of what went before.It’s also worth reminding ourselves that when Tax Credits rolled out, nearly  million people never got their benefits.But there have been some problems with the implementation of Universal Credit.Firstly, cuts to the system in  have made transition onto it harder and drove my own resignation in part. I have, alongside organisations, such as the Centre for Social Justice, have since campaigned to see those cuts reversed.It is to the current Government’s great credit that they have re-invested about £ billion of the £ billion taken out, but it can go further. Investing in Universal Credit should be a priority.A system that supports work is itself a health policy with huge benefits.The educational outcomes for a child in a working household increase - girls who grow up in jobless households spend an average of two years less in school than those whose parents work, and boys spend one year less. If we want to tackle the current mental health problems in the UK, work has a vital role to play.Secondly, the design of the new system is meant to help people get work ready. Fundamentally Universal Credit is not just a tool for financial support but for changing lives.It does this in part by using online applications, helping people take responsibility for their own rent, and receiving their income in monthly arrears like a pay cheque.But for some people, particularly those with dficult and chaotic lives, this change, though important and right, has been hard to navigate.Some payment flexibility has now been added but it’s time to invest in Universal Support [programmes that help people making a claim for Universal Credit and give them online money support - such as budgeting advice].This support package was designed to run alongside Universal Credit and help support those in the greatest need but has been all too thinly rolled out.For the most vulnerable in society, this aspect is crucial, and must become a priority. As should the areas for change that The Sun is highlighting in its campaign.The Sun is right, a full-time job is still the single best way out of poverty, which is why making Universal Credit work should be our priority because as Joseph Rowntree said, properly rolled out, UC has the greatest capacity to tackle poverty."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000456883003.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"don mccullin photography exhibition tate vietnam","story":"The exhibition includes black and white scenes of the Vietnam war, The Troubles and the recent conflict in Syria.As well as capturing the horror of war-torn countries, the iconic photographer focuses on the trials and tribulations of what is happening on our doorsteps.McCullin recorded scenes of poverty and working class live in Londons East End and the industrial north.Two young boys posed in front of brick wall spray-painted with No Nazis in Bradford.The photographer risked his own le to capture the breathtaking images, sheltering from bullets as he took the photographs.In contrast to the bleak scenes of poverty in London he spent time shooting the rolling hills and glorious landscapes of his hometown of Somerset.One of the photos on display features a homeless Irishman in Spitalfields, London in .The whites of his eyes are striking against his dull and dirty skin tone -

compared with America’s £billion.Writing in today’s Sun, the Minister says: “We retain the most professional Armed Forces in the world, brilliantly trained and well equipped.We know that countries such as Russia and China are asserting themselves both regionally but their actions will soon global consequences challenging our security, stability and prosperity.And of course extremismis far from defeated.Our adversaries now challenge us below the traditional threshold of tradition conflict, in the ‘grey zone’, that sits between war and peace- where the rules are vague.Assassinations, information warfare, interference with supply chains, cyber attacks, fake news - all go gain advantage and sow confusion.The first responsibility of any Government is to defend country.But Britain does more than that.We have a long established reputation of not only looking after our own interest but of our allies too.Thanks to our history, our valued relationships and leadership, we have a unique perspective of the world.Our respected soft power allows us to play an influential role on the international stage as a force for good.This justies our permeant seat at the UN Security Council Yet as the world becomes more dangerous and complex– ever fewer countries retain the ability to step forward and challenge this new instability.If this trend in instability continues to go unchecked it will become the norm.So our Defence Modernisation Programme, announced by Gavin Williamson this week, is a timely and ambitious plan to upgrade our defence posture.But this will require investment - confirmed at the next Spending Review.If we are to secure further defence spending the nation must demand it.So let’s first have an honest conversation with the nation about our current capabilities, the threats that loom ahead and the consequences to our way of lewe do not upgrade.Russia and China know our strengths and weaknesses better than the public does.So we must use the Modernisation Programme to bury the myths that the nation’s relative security is not a given and the international rule book that’s helped keep the relative peace for a generation is now out of date.Russia’s level of aggression remains on the accent.The capture of three Ukrainian ships last month illustrate how they are ever exploiting new ways to assert their influence.Kremlin sponsored bots pollute conversation in democratic nations across the world, and military intelligence service GRU has been caught out operating a series of indiscriminate cyber attacks.Their digital technology is developing at a breath-taking pace.China’s military influence in the East Asia seas and now across Africa continues go advance.Their navy is growing by the size of our Navy every year.And they continue to rush to dominate G, the next generation of cellular technology which will revolutionise our lives.Dominance of data ownership is China’s mission - effectively controlling the internet and the world’s connectivity.We retain the most professional Armed Forces in the world, brilliantly trained and well equipped.But whilst the Royal Navy and RAF have enjoyed some impressive equipment advancements the Army is still using a Main Battle Tank and Armoured Personnel Carrier that’s not been upgraded in two decades.Russia’s on its third iteration in the same timeframe.But its not just in the conventional space where the Defence Secretary wants to invest, but in the domains of cyberspace and space - where the absence of established rules provide the most scope for hostile action.Areas such as AI, autonomy, directed energy weaponscan manoeuvre a hypersonic speeds.They are evolving at an incredible speed and must act to retain our competitive edge.Simply put, without investment in our hard power, we will not keep up an we will unable to respond to this fast changing world.Effectively removing ourselves from that international leadership role which we have prided ourselves for decades.And it is leadership that’s needed to recognise the tried and tested diplomatic instruments and conventions that we relied on to keep the peace are no longer fit for purpose.Exploitation of new technologies is un-regulated.So which nation is willing to step forward a call and help write a new International rule book This is not just a clever call for increased defence spending but a recognition that access to Britain’s physical and digital international markets will need protectingour post Brexit economy is to continue to prosper.The proposal modernise and transform defence will ensure we remain, nog just engaged and committed - but physically able to defend our values and our way of le.It’s now for the British people to make the choice.“But whilst the Royal Navy and RAF have enjoyed some impressive equipment advancements, our Army is still using a Main Battle tank and Armoured Personnel Carrier that’s not been upgraded in two decades.”He added: “The danger is without investment in hard power we will be unable to respond evenwe want to. It’s not just about money for defence but by investing now we invest in our prosperity.”The blast comes after Mr Ellwood – who served as a captain in the Royal Green Jackets – risked the ire of No. by criticising Donald Trump for pulling out of the Syrian conflict.On Twitter he said the President was wrong to assume the war against Da’esh was “won”.The Minister – who memorably tried to save PC Keith Palmer in the Westminster terror attack – said Britain had to adjust its military capability to reflect the changing threat from the “grey zone”.He said the Ministry of Defence was already looking to invest in Articial Intelligence and areas such as energy weapons – lasers.He added: “We must be honest - our soft power will diminishwe don’t invest in our hard power.”Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson earlier this week said the UK had to be prepared to fight wars with AI and in space.And, unveiling a Modernising Defence Programmehe insisted Britain had to try and “keep pace” with its nation-state competitors.Mr Ellwood said the MDP programme was “a timely and ambitious plan to upgrade our defence posture”.But he said: “It will require investment – confirmed at the next Spending Review.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet all too often, their needs are ignored.My own family started as blacksmiths in Uttoxeter, Staffs.In , my father, Joseph Cyril Bamford, rented a lock-up garage for  shillings a week.He developed Europe’s first hydraulic tipping trailer for use by local farmers — and then, in , the backhoe loader, the classic JCB digger.JCB — JC Bamford Excavators Ltd — has produced more than a million machines.We have a turnover of more than £billion and factories around the world.Yet we remain a proud ­family business, headquartered in the Midlands and employing thousands of people there.Ours is not a unique success story. Yet it is rarer than it should be.Our main factory in Staffs used to be surrounded by thriving family manufacturers, mostly in the Black Country, Birmingham and Manchester.Over the decades, they have disappeared — because of tax regimes that made it impossible to pass firms on, or takeovers that stripped away what was special about the company, or government mandarins who thought they knew better what industry needed.In Germany, their world-class manufacturing sector thrives because they champion family firms, not least via tax breaks that make it normal for ownership to move across generations.In Britain, the tax system pushes entrepreneurs to sell up, and family businesses find it harder to get finance.No wonder that fewer than  per cent expect to keep their firm in the family.Yet we at JCB still have many excellent family firms among our suppliers — and our customers.In manufacturing, there are more than a quarter of a million family companies, employing more than a million people in jobs that add real value to the community.And such firms are found in every sector of the economy, not just ours.A company such as JCB is big enough to stand up for, and speak for, itself.But too many small firms do not get a hearing in government.Despite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises — SMEs — are creating almost three times as many jobs as larger firms, it is the voice of the giants that dominates.Yes, these large firms contribute enormously to the economy, but they tend to be the most comfortable with the status quo.They might moan about regulation but they can afford to deal with it, knowing that it deters their smaller competitors.They see Brexit, for example, in terms of costs, rather than opportunities. This is reflected in government.Theresa May’s approach to Brexit was safety-first, focusing on protecting the cross-border supply chains of the multi-nationals.Yet  per cent of British firms do not export. Their main worries are to do with competition and regulation.But regulation, in particular, is harder to addresswe are still following European rules — as is striking new trade deals.Protecting the big companies means reducing opportunities for little ones.I voted, proudly and publicly, for Leave.I believe there is nothing to fear in trading on World Trade Organisation terms, as we at JCB already do — exporting to, and importing from, dozens of countries around the world.But this is not about Brexit. Millions of business owners throughout the country feel they are not represented or spoken for.Polling by Deltapoll recently found that even Tory voters do not think their party is on the side of small business.For the politicians who listen to these firms, the rewards will be political as well as economic.I have spent my le working in a family business.I believe family businesses, of all sizes, are tied to and invested in their communities in a way other firms can never be.And I worry that Britain has a model of tax, regulation and politics in which everything is arranged to suit the big firms on the FTSE, not those that might one day hope to replace them.Whatever the outcome of the Brexit wrangling, we can only succeed long termwe make Britain the best place in the world to start, run and keep a business of your own.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bob, for sure. The sponge with the Bob and the shorts ”At which point, things started getting even weirder for Gino on Michael McIntyre’s Big Show.A programme which, I realise, wasn’t the main television event of the weekend. That was the Strictly Come Dancing final.But so what  It’s Christmas, and after  months largely spent telling you what television shows I don’t like, it seems only fair to celebrate one that I do. Why Simple. Michael McIntyre is one of the very few comedians left on television who realises it’s his duty to make viewers laugh rather than bend and bully them into their left-wing point of view.A noble calling, obviously, but there’d be no point taking this mainstream approachthe resulting show was also cheesy, unprofessional and talked down to its audience.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show falls into none of those traps. Apart from being riotously funny, it’s also clever, charmingly savage at times and ided into three equally slick segments that can all carry an embarrassing musical interlude from Cheryl Tweedy, who stamped around, in elephant leggings, like a mad woman on Saturday’s show.They take it in turns to be the highlight of the show as well. A fortnight ago Bradley Walsh’s send-to-all stunt was the best bit.Last week it was the unexpected-star-of-the-show slot and, at the weekend, it was undoubtedly the Midnight Gameshow with Gino, who had eight stabs before sort of nailing: “SpongeBob with the square pants.”His torment was only just beginning, however, as he was then asked to ID the mystery celebrity singing in his shower.Easy in normal circumstances, but, right on cue, Gino had developed a: “First thing in the morning moment”, and had to shuffle next door with a pillow hiding his embarrassment.If he had the problem, though, Michael McIntyre definitely had the solution.“It’s Sinitta!” he yelled, killing the “first thing in the morning” problem stone dead, which was probably just as well, because he was hugging Boycie from Only Fools And Horses a second or two later.It wasn’t just Gino’s physical responses that were the making of this stunt, though, it was the fact that, having been presented with all this random madness, as well as a goat called Olivia, he asked the single best television question I’ve heard all year.“Are we live ”“LIVE ” responded McIntyre, barely able to contain himself. “It’s one in the morning, Gino.”It’s tempting, then, to describe the whole thing as television perfection.Perfection, though, would’ve involved Gino asking, as he did: “Who comes to houses at this time of the evening ” and McIntyre opening his bedroom cupboard door with a “TA-DA! Paul Young does, Gino.”A Dominatrix on C’s The Sex Business: Pain For Pleasure B Head of Drama at the BBC THE BBC really has created a Sports Personality Of The Year show in the image of its co-host Clare Balding and her all-consuming inferiority complex, hasn’t it A vast and murky event that clearly thinks it’s an adorable, all-inclusive, finger-on-the-pulse, rock ’n’ roll jamboree but is actually a nerdy, uptight, controlling, gender-obsessed, PC quota-thon of the most self-deceiving kind.So Tyson Fury, who has a genuine personality, was excluded from the final six, but Billie Jean King was all over proceedings and England’s Common-wealth Games netball women were apparently the “team of the year”.SPOTY was at its absolute worst, though, trying to do populist, celebrating the all-conquering England World Cup football team , with some BBC-approved patriotism.That is to say, a multi-cultural version of Three Lions, featuring Bhangra dancers, a steel band and a gospel choir, without whom, the BBC presumably imagined, England fans would be goose-stepping round the NEC burning crosses.No one can say for surethis ill-judged segment influenced the final vote, won by Welsh cyclist Geraint Thomas, of course, but Harry Kane started the night as favourite and ended it third, after something  happened during the song that was so horrendous and disturbing no one who heard the incident can ever mention it or the offender ever again.I hope you’re bloody proud of yourself, David Baddiel.The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote the Keats poem Ode To A Nightingale ”Joe Lycett: “Which American state is home to the Dallas Cowboys ”And  to , Sandi Toksvig: “What five-letter word for a native of one of the Scandinavian countries is also a British name for a root vegetable similar to a turnip ”GOOD Morning Britain, Tuesday Piers Morgan: “The lady who brings our food in has announced she’s quitting.

The Transport Secretary admitted the assembled government, military and police genuinely dont know who ruined more than , peoples Christmas plans in the last  hours. Asked by BBC Radio a foreign power could be responsible, Chris Grayling replied: I don’t want to speculate on that. We genuinely don’t know who it is or what the motivation was. I think it’s unlikely to be but at the moment I’m not ruling out anything.” Mr Grayling said there had been a number of drones at Britains second-biggest airport and the culprit could be a rogue lone wolf or a group actor. He added: It could be an environmental protest but we genuinely don’t know.”  But he added: “Its certainly not linked to terrorism in the conventional sense.” Mr Grayling said those responsible should go to jail for a long time”. He added: “They can face a jail sentence and should face an extended jail sentence.” It comes weeks after Gatwick revealed plans to open a second runway by bringing into operation its emergency landing strip for routine take-offs and landings.Mr Grayling said “military capability” is being used to stop the drones at Gatwick together with commercially-available methods.  “Its a new kind of attack that we are going to have to make sure we are prepared for,” Mr Grayling told the BBC.“This is an entirely new kind of threat and we are going to have to move quickly.” Defending his handling of the chaos, he insisted: “There is no single, simple solution off the shelf deliverable very quickly.” He also condemned those who suggested the drones be shot out of the sky. He said literally thousands of machine gun bullets” had been shot at drones before without removing them from the air. “You can’t just fire weapons haphazardly in what is a built up area around an airport,” he added.

They already include stockpiling food, turning motorway stretches into a lorry park, putting , troops on standby and chartering a plane to bring medical supplies to the NHS from Maastricht. Now The Times reports officials do not believe there will be food shortages - but some perishable goods may not be available.  This could include fruit from Spain or vegetables from the Netherlands, it is reported, which could be held up by extra customs checks. If this happens internal planners are actively discussing whether Brits will have to y their diet to cope, The Times reports. Ian Wright, director-general of the Food and Drink Federation, told the newspaper: “This illustrates the really grisly nature of a no-deal outcome. Quite simply, the British people would not forgive anyone responsible for it coming to pass. SNP MP Peter Grant said: Change your diet.

So dont be surprised peace has broken out - temporarily, and in a way that probably wont change a thing - between Jacob Rees-Mogg and Theresa May. The MP was among  Tory Hard Brexiteers who met the Prime Minister at No this week, just days after trying to topple her in a no confidence vote. But the Tory leaders position looks just as precarious as ever. Speaking to the Mirror afterwards, Mr Rees-Mogg warned he will still vote against her Brexit deal next monthshe cant drop a isive backstop. And it came as Remain-backing MPs plot an ambush of measures in Parliament to stop a No Deal Brexit as soon as the Commons s on January .  MPs will vote on the Brexit deal in the week of January  after Theresa May was forced to delay the Commons showdown for more than a month. Both Brexiteers and Remainers are angry at plans for a backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules indefinitely. Theresa May is trying to win them round - but her path to victory looks near-impossible after the EU insisted it would not ditch the backstop. According to reports today, Mr Rees-Mogg remarked even the policeman on the door looked surprised when he turned up in Downing Street on Tuesday. Six days earlier he had led a failed coup to oust her in which  out of  Tory MPs voted no confidence in her leadership.  The Times claimed Mrs May empathised with him over hard-hitting press coverage of the failed bid - which saw him compared to a Dads Army character. Mr Rees-Mogg disputed this, saying: We did not discuss the press at all. But he confirmed the meeting took place, and said he could possibly support the Brexit dealthe backstop was removed - something the EU refuse to do. Meanwhile Labour MPs are reportedly uniting with Remain-backing Tory rebels in order to scupper any hope of a no deal Brexit. Rolling “contempt” motions and multiple “killer” amendments are being drafted in a move that could even block parts of the Budget.  One amendment would prevent the government from changing taxes in a no-deal scenario without parliament’s consent, HuffPost UK reported. No Deal plans already include stockpiling food, turning motorway stretches into a lorry park, putting , troops on standby and chartering a plane to bring medical supplies to the NHS from Maastricht. No Deal Brexit could also force Brits to y their diet, leaked plans warn. Theresa May is facing a public Cabinet split as ministers set out rival plans forMPs vote down her Brexit plan in the week of January . Ministers including Andrea Leadsom have talked up the chances of a so-called managed no deal. But Justice Secretary David Gauke hinted that could force him to quit, saying: “I think making a conscious decision to proceed with no deal would not be the responsible course of action.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror delayed tory post","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Delayed Tory post-immigration plans have satisfied no oneTheresa Mays latest white paper was a missed opportunity to help those where the impact of immigration has been felt the strongestShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  DEC NewsopinionThe latest flim-flam document from Theresa May adds little to an important debate \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter months of delay, the Government published its post-Brexit shyimmigration plans yesterday — and satisfied no one.

Many people have legitimate concerns about the level of migration. But this flim-flam document adds little to the debate. Home Secretary Sajid Javid still wants a pound, salary threshold for those coming in despite warnings that it will leave hospitals and care homes dangerously understaffed. Theresa May’s arbitrary target to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands remains in place even though it has never been met. And there is nothing to help areas where the impact of immigration has been felt the strongest.  We need a system that is humane, benefits the economy and is accepted by the public.

But after two and a half hours his parents say they were left waiting and waiting before being told that the operation wasnt a success and surgeons operated on the wrong one by mistake, castrating him.

The youngsters dad, whose name has not been revealed to protect his sons identity, said his sons undescended testicle was discovered during a routine check-up. The toddler was referred to a specialist and on Monday he was booked in for an operation at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, which would last around  minutes.

She was just  when she had her right breast removed and reconstructed after being diagnosed with breast cancer in .Laura decided to have the other breast removed and reconstructed in , the Liverpool Echo reported.But she started to have a severe reaction to her implant after her second reconstruction, and claims her skin turned yellow, she had pain down her left arm and that she was getting really tired.  Because of this Laura made the brave decision to remove both of her implants in April of this year. Yesterday, the yoga teacher took to Facebook to post her response after two men she used to know made ignorant comments about the way she looks. Laura said: In the last week, I’ve had two male friends, who I haven’t seen in a long time, say to people in front of me: You should have seen Laura in her heyday,  years ago. Rude. Or am I supposed to be grateful that guys used to think I was hot ! If I hadn’t been through everything I have, and was still the girl I was  years ago, it might crush me to hear that.

She hit back at comments that her heyday was  years ago, when in reality she has never felt more comfortable in her own skin, also saying she chose to publicly share her experience for the women. Laura added: It makes me laugh that some people think my heyday was when I wore a face full of make up, perfect hair, sexy outfits, padded bras. I.e. dressing for someone ’s approval. F*** that. I’m strong and capable, I stand up for what I believe in. I walk away from people or situations that make me uncomfortable. And I wear what makes me feel happy, not sexy. A lot of my ’s were spent working in the world of high-end nightclubs where image, money and status were everything, and I’m proud that I‘m no longer part of that.  I’m proud that I care more about what I think than what anyone  thinks. Laura takes pride in the fact that she hasnt succumbed to the pressures of botox and fillers, despite that the complications of her implants rapidly aged her skin. She added: This is not me having a digyou’ve had botox, I understand what it’s like to be so self-critical you won’t even leave the house, it’s just that after having my breasts amputated twice through illness, I’ve learned to appreciate my body exactly the way it is.

Ben and Olivia Sargent, six and nine, were on a dream family holiday with their mums Kerry and Jules Sargent. But the trip turned into a nightmare on a night out for dinner with friends when Kerry, from Gloucester, was killed in a head-on collision near Whangarei. The children’s other mum, Jules Sargent, was rushed to hospital with serious, le-threatening injuries, some of which it is expected will take her years to recover from, reports Gloucestershire Live. Currently the -year-old is too unwell to travel, leaving her and theirtwo children spending their Christmas in the city of Whangarei in North Island of New Zealand, north of the capital. Although they were not seriously injured, they have been traumatised and deeply scarred by the incident.   Ben has told his mum he can’t remember the good times before the crash. Both he and his sister are being cared for by friends but a GoFundMe page has been set up in a bid to raise pound, and help them create some magical moments that they can all look forward to. It is hoped these will provide light during the darker times. Family friend Alan York said: “Currently, Jules is recuperating in New Zealand with the friends she went out to visit and will need a substantial period of recovery before the family canto England. “Until then, Ben and Olivia have been schooled in New Zealand while Jules undergoes physiotherapy before the doctors can assess whether she is fit enough to take the children on their long journey home.” In the crash, Jules broke her ribs, right leg and two vertebra, and her toes were dislocated. Her left arm was also injured and she has an open wound to her left hip area which also fractured part of the hip bone. She has been told the injury to her left arm could take up to two years to recover from.   Speaking from hospital in New Zealand Jules said: I was so shocked when Alan first told me about the Magical Memories campaign. I didnt think people would respond in this way to our situation, but it is really comforting to know how much people care and want to help my children. They have been through such a traumatic experience as they were initially stuck in the car whilst it was on its roof and had to be rescued by friends smashing the windows to get them out.It was a terrying experience for everyone but Ben and Olivia have shown so much courage throughout this whole situation. I am so proud of them of both. Ben has said ‘he cant think about the good times before the accident all he can remember is the accident.’ This amazing campaign will be used to help them overcome the trauma and create some more happy memories. Mr York added: Jules’ recovery period is expected to be very y and we, as friends of the family, want to help Ben and Olivia get through what will inevitably be some very tough times over the next few years, given how involved their mums were in all aspects of their lives. With your support, we want to help get the whole family safely home back to the UK and give Olivia and Ben experiences that will enrich their childhood and transform their lives for the better after this terrible experience.

Meanwhile, farmers battled hard to bring Christmas dinner to our tables this year - due to the heatwaves effect on crops and livestock, according to experts. The baking summer caused problems for staple foods and festive favourites alike such as turkey, pigs in blankets and carrots. Potatoes were planted late this year, carrots struggled to grow in the C heat and wilted, and the hot temperatures also made turkeys lose their appetites, while pigs needed extra help with cooling down.  But do not worry about Christmas pudding, as many of the ingredients - mixed dried fruit, nuts and rum - are imported so it looks asthis festive favourite has escaped the extreme UK weather. Dr Nicola Cannon, principal lecturer in agronomy at the Royal Agricultural University in Gloucestershire, said: If you sit down to a Christmas lunch, please think about the complex issues farmers deal with to bring this special meal to your table.

He insists that he told staff he did not want to the dog to be fully shaved - but he was horried toover an hour later and find Effy virtually “pink” after having had her body sheared. Pets At Home have said Effy was shaved for her own welfare due to the extent of the matted fur.   Mr Wilks, , from Kingswood in Hull, said: “I told them I did not want her shaving all over. They said she was matted everywhere but she wasn’t as she’d only been bathed and brushed on Monday. “When I saw the state of her I wanted to shout and start swearing but I didn’t – I kept my cool and I said nothing because I just wanted to get out of the store.” After ing home, Mrs Wilks “burst into tears” when she saw her beloved pet before angrily taking to Facebook to rant about the procedure which she likened to “torture” for Effy.   The -year-old beautician said: “We are absolutely distraught, disgusted and gutted [by] what The Groom Room Pets At Home Hull has done to my baby girl! “Her poor bottom has been completely stripped as has all her fur! Please be aware this place is nothing but a Shave Room! “I hope [you’re] happy and would love to get responses and advice from anyone, as I would love to sue them for what they have done! She has been shaking with anxiety since she ed this afternoon! Their attitude in response has been disgusting!” Mr Wilks said he was even more aggrieved after Pets at Home charged him an extra pound to have Effy’s body shaved.  “Originally it was pound but they put an extra pound on for the satisfaction of shaving her all over which I didn’t want done,” the dad-of-two said. “They offered me the deposit back but they said it in such a nonchalant way I thought they were being clever.” Mr Wilks said he and his we, who have used The Groom Room twice before, went to the pet store because their normal dog groomer was on holiday. However, he said the pair will now boycott the shop after Effy’s shaving which has had serious repercussions on the young pup, according to Mr Wilks. He said: “We wanted to get her done for Christmas like anyone would but now we are going to have to take her to the vet because she is constantly shaking and is even defecating inside.  “They have traumatised her and it’s freezing now so she is constantly shivering. She is pink and it looks like she has just come out of an operation. “They said they would have to shave under her legs which was not a problem. I understood that but the last thing I said to them was ‘don’t shave all over.’”What Pets at Home saysA spokesman for the pet supplies retailer, which has more than  stores and , employees, said: “Ourgroomers are highly trained and will always put the welfare of pets first. “When Effy was brought in to our Hull store to be groomed it was explained that, because her coat was heavily matted, particularly around her legs and shoulders, it would have to be clipped close to the skin, purely for the welfare of the dog. “We believe that clipping a matted coat is kinder, faster and gentler for the pet. Effy’s owner, Mr Wilks, was advised of this, including the additional pound matting charge. “Our groomers offered to refund the deposit and not groom Effy, but the customer agreed to go ahead and signed both our clipping policy, and pet grooming salon contract. “We hope that Effy will be happier and healthier with her matted coat now removed and our expert groomers would be happy to helpMr Wilks has any further concerns.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gatwick passenger stunned easyjet boarding","story":"NewsGatwick passenger stunned at easyJet boarding pass showing advert for DRONECustomer Benoît Guilbaud saw the funny side but remarked at the irony of the advert seeing as more than , people have had travel plans ruinedShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  DEC NewsBenoît Guilbaud saw the funny side \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn easyJet passenger was stunned when he printed out his boarding pass only to see an advert for a drone at the bottom - amid days of chaos at Gatwick Airport.

Yes, I would agree that’s a possibility.   “At this stage we’re certainly not linking it to terrorism, but obviously we keep an open mind and I can understand the perception. “It is, as I say, an unprecedented level of disruption to national infrastructure to the passengers themselves. It’s really really signicant. But in terms of the motivation as I say you know we’re exploring lines of enquiry around that but at this stage we’re not saying that it is terrorist related.” Around  departures are expected to go ahead today, the chief operating officer announced.

She also delivered cakes to the local fire station and performed at Avondale Park Primary school in North Kensington, the school which many of the young people affected attend. Meghan, who is a self-confessed foodie, was said to be delighted to introduce Harry to the women she has worked so closely with to create the charity cookbook Together: Our Community Cookbook, in which she wrote a foreword.   It is the third private engagement - away from the media by deciding not to invite them - that Meghan has taken part in in recent weeks. Two weeks ago she attended a meeting with educators, academic leaders, and students at King’s College for the Association of Commonwealth Universities, an inter-university network for schools across the British Commonwealth. Days later she appeared on stage in a surprise at the British Fashion Council awards to present an honour to Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy who designed her wedding dress. Meghan has previously said shes taken some of the kitchens food home for Harry to try. A royal source said: After the Grenfell Tower disaster, Harry visited the Al-Manaar mosque which is attached to the Hubb Community Kitchen with his brother William. He has met many of the women before at Meghans book launch at Kensington Palace, but this was the first time he has visited the kitchen.  He loved meeting the women whom his we has spoken so fondly of over the last year and is a huge supporter of their work. The cookery book, which was published in September, came about after a group of women - victims of the Grenfell Tower fire - gathered at the Al Manaar community centre and used the kitchen to prepare fresh meals for their friends, families and neighbours. During the private engagement, which was reported in the Court Circular, the royal couple will have been updated on how the community has moved forward, and will have seen how the Hubb Community Kitchen has improved. The Mirror last month revealed how Meghan, , had struck up a deep and personal friendship with several survivors A palace source said: “The Duchess has made regular private visits to the kitchen and to the women of Hubb and will continue to do so.   She has said how moved she has been by their courage and togetherness, and hopes by working together and collaborating on projects like the book they can find strength moving forward. Another source close to Meghan said: Meghan has promised she will not let the survivors be forgotten. The book was just an example of the way she is using her  for good and we are definitely going to see more of this. Behind closed doors, she has taken it to heart and sees it as her personal duty to help the survivors after being so deeply moved by their stories. She has promised to stand by them for as long as it takes. In September, Meghan hosted an event at Kensington Palace to celebrate the release of the charity cookbook. Together reached number one onAmazonbook chart within hours of being announced, and has appeared in the Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller lists. In the UK, more than , copies have been sold, raising pound,. Tens of thousands more have been sold internationally.

Teachers were bundled to the ground and kicked as they tried to break up a fracas last month. Two staff members and a student were left with minor injuries in the scuffle, Birmingham Live reported. Ninestiles An Academy in Acocks Green, Birmingham, hired a security guard to patrol the school ever since. The school previously hit the headlines after pupils were ordered to be silent when walking to lessons - as some likened it to a North Korean gulag. Andrea Stephens, co-head Ninestiles, An Academy, said: We wrote to all parents around four weeks ago to say that we had taken the initiative by arranging an additional security presence at our front entrance.  This followed an incidentthat involved an assault by people from outside the school. This measure adds another layer of care and safety to the wellbeing of our students as they leave the school. We are taking a tough stand on poor behaviour and will not tolerate unkind or rude behaviour from a very few students. The vast majority of our students are delightful and well-behaved young people, and we know that most parents support us in our work to ensure that the highest standards of behaviour and welfare are in place. The welfare of our students and our staff is a key priority and this measure provides reassurance to our school community.  In November, police said the punch-up began at the school gates at .pm. A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: “Police were called to reports of an assault at Ninestiles Academy in Hartfield Crescent, Acocks Green at around .pm on Monday . It is believed a fight started between a group of people at the school gates. When teachers tried to intervene, they were knocked over and kicked. Two staff members and a student were left with minor injuries. No arrests were made.  The school made headlines earlier this year when it ordered pupils to walk the corridors in silence or face a -minute detention. In a joint statement addressing concerns from parents, co-heads Alex Hughes and Andrea Stephens said: Ninestiles is committed to the highest standards of behaviour and we know that students arriving to lessons ready to learn can be further supported by doing so in silence at certain points in the day. This is already an expectation for arrival at exams and during fire drills and, as such, is simply an extension of that code of behaviour. We will review this change at the end of Term  and the views of our students, parents and carers will be welcomed as part of that process.

Outbreaks of rain should be expected across Northern England, Northern Ireland and northern Wales - but the south should remain relatively dry. The soggy weather will add to transport woes as experts warn of disruption caused by millions of additional journeys on Britains roads. Alex Deacon from the Met Office today says Friday evening will be even wetter, with heavy rain moving in and that wet and increasingly windy weather will spread across parts of England and Wales.  “The winds will really start whip up soyou’re travelling that will be very unpleasant.” Conditions will improve on Saturday and it will be drier throughout - but showers in the north will persist for some.

While some people don their fanciest frocks and do the rounds to see loved ones, for others the perfect day involves tuning into the Christmas TV specials in Father Christmas PJs. Just like the rest of us, the Royal Family come together to spend the special day together - and a lot of their traditions arent too much dferent to the ones us normal folk enjoy. They tuck into a big turkey dinner , eat Christmas cake and exchange presents. But there also a few extra special traditions thrown in there - well, they are royal after all.  Heres a full step-by-step guide to what the Royal Family get up to on Christmas Day. Christmas Eve Afternoon tea Once the family have all arrived and unpacked, they gather for afternoon tea. Its believed to be a formal occasion, with the men in black tie and the women wearing gowns and jewels. Opening presents To incorporate their German heritage into the festivities, the family open their presents on Christmas Eve as is traditional in the country. Shortly after they arrive they all lay their gts out on dferent tables, so each guest has their own little pile. Prince Philip oversees organising the gts and tells everyone when they can open them. The family exchange cheap joke presents, and in the past Kate bought Harry a Grow your Own Girlfriend Kit and the Prince got his granny a Les a B**** shower cap.  Christmas Day Breakfast The royals kick off the big day with breakfast, but many of the couples split up for the first festive meal. According to former royal chef Darren McGrady the women tend to eat in their rooms while the men sit together downstairs. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: On Christmas Day, the ladies generally opt for a light breakfast of sliced fruit, half a grapefruit, toast and coffee delivered to their rooms. The men on the other hand have a much heartier breakfast, usually including eggs, bacon, mushrooms, kippers and grilled kidneys. Church The public get to see the Royals when they head out to a traditional Christmas Day church service at St Mary Magdalene. Hundreds of well-wishers usually gather to see them as they walk into the building, and they often stop to have a chat on the way out. Trips to Church is the only time the Queen carries cash, and she normally pops either a fiver or a tenner in the collection pot - but it could be more at Christmas.  Christmas lunch The festive feast is the main event in most homes on Christmas Day, and its no dferent for the Royals who site down to eat at pm. Former royal chef Darren McGrady revealed exactly what the Queen eats during an interview with Good Housekeeping . He said: After church, thats when they have a big lunch that includes a salad with shrimp or lobster, and a roasted turkey, and all of your traditional side dishes like parsnips, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and Christmas pudding with brandy butter for dessert. They stick with the same meal year after year. Sounds delicious!  The Queens Speech Yep, thats right - just like the rest of us the Royal Family sit down and watch grannys speech on the BBC at pm. Its prerecorded which means the Queen can watch it back surrounded by her loved ones. Afternoon tea After the speech they all go off for a bit of free time, before gathering again for afternoon tea and a slice of Christmas fruit cake. Chats with the Queen According to former royal butler Paul Burrell, all the royals like to have a one-to-one chat with the Queen during the day, but theres one popular time to do it. Before Princess Dianas first royal Christmas, he advised her to try and get some quality time with the monarch when she was sitting at her card table. Speaking to the Mail Online, he said: All these people are members of the royal family, they are all larger than le, have character to go with it. Everyone is jostling for position and attention, and theyre bouncing off the walls after four days. Its like a pinball machine. They all want to please the Queen and want airtime with her, its the one time that they can sit down with the head of the family and make an impression.  Its what I said to Diana when she first came into the family, try to get airtime with the Queen, speak into her ear. The best time to do it is when shes seated at her card table, before and after dinner, she will sit and play Bridge or Canasta and shell always ask people to join her, thats your chance to get quality time and tell the monarch what youre thinking and feeling. Dinner Before long its time for ANOTHER meal, and the royal chefs put on an evening buffet for dinner. Former chef Darren McGrady said theres a buffet dinner with - dferent items. Its always a buffet with the chefs at the table carving. Before they all tuck in the senior chef goes into the dining room and carves the meat. Once hes done, the Queen gives him a glass of whiskey and they toast. Its the only time the chef is invited into the dining room. He also revealed that the Queen has a real penchant for chocolate, particularly the dark and minty iety. Apparently she always has a chocolate treat on Christmas. Boxing Day The next day the family will head on on their annual Boxing Day pheasant hunt. Prince Harry, who has been taking part in the tradition for about  years, will be skipping it this year to keep his new we Meghan happy.  One Royal source told the Sunday Mirror: William sees this as another concerning example of his brother being pulled away from his family by his new we. Harrys always loved hunting and it has provided them with a great chance to bond as brothers. But now it looks like Harrys shooting days are over. Its the latest point of contention between the Princes. Some of the family leave the estate to visit other relatives on Boxing Day. The Cambridges, for example, will head off to celebrate with Kates family, where they enjoy another busy day of festive fun.

After months of rigorous planning, everything theyve been dreaming of is finally happening and its only natural that theyd want everything to run smoothly. They might have a wedding planner on hand to help ensure that nothing can possibly go wrong on the big day, but sometimes its only the bride who can take matters into her own hands and fix a problem. This was the situation one woman found herself in when her wedding planner failed to resolve a sticky situation at her reception.   In a post on Reddit, the unnamed bride revealed all the details and asked whether people thought she had done the right thing in the end. So what was it that she did  The woman kicked a couple out of her reception because they brought their children along with them and she didnt want little ones spoiling her big day. She explained: This couple Im not very close with but the we is a long-time family friend so I felt that I should invite her.   To be clear all of my wedding invitations stated that there will be no children at this wedding, but she and her husband showed up with their infant and toddler. At the actual wedding ceremony, I let it slide. I was preoccupied for obvious reasons. I also thought that maybe they planned not to attend the reception or to have someone pick the kids up before it started. She continued: Anyway the reception rolls around, the couple comes and, lo and behold, they still have their children. I had many other guests and didnt really feel like dealing with it so I asked our event planner to go over to them and discuss whether someone was picking the children up as the reception was not supposed to have children - everyone was drinking and loud and rowdy and a crying child and another little one running around was not part of the plan.   The woman claims the couple then began arguing with the wedding planner, so she stepped in to handle the situation. I think they thought I came to rescue them, she admitted. They started going on about how rude my event planner was. I explained that I had actually sent him over to discuss the children. I reiterated that the even was child-free and said that I had stated so clearly on my invitations. The we sort of apologised, but then proclaimed that she was capable of making sure her children didnt get in the way of things, but it didnt do much to reassure the bride. Eventually after more heated conversation she snapped and told the couple they needed to go.   She added: The whole scene was incredibly embarrassing which is exactly what I wanted to avoid. I really hate that my wedding day had to be somewhat marred by this incident. According to my mother, everyone was talking about it and I guess enjoying a little dramatic entertainment. Was I an a**hole for making them leave  Many people took the time to comment on her post, agreeing that she hadnt done anything wrong.  One person wrote: When someone says no kids, it means NO KIDS! Another posted: For them to argue about it was even more outrageous. You dont have to explain or justy why you didnt want kids at your own wedding. A third added: The inconsiderate couple who thought they were somehow excluded from the child-free part of the invitation are a**holes!

After taking a closer look at the calendar, the mum-of-three was horried to discover that the apple flavoured chocolates she thought shed given her child, were actually made of yoghurt and catnip - and were intended to be consumed by cats. Jess, who lives in Oswestry, Shropshire, said: I was in shock and felt like the worst mother ever when I realised Id bought her a calendar for cats.

Three more were picked up later in the city, the Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said. Moroccos general prosecutor on Thursday confirmed the authenticity of a video in which he said the four pledged allegiance to Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In the video, which was posted on social media, the suspects threatened to carry out attacks, the general prosecutor said in a statement. Investigations by the bureau also showed the video was made last week before the killing of the two women. The evidence discovered so far pointed to a terrorist motive, the bureau said. Preliminary investigations of the video found that it was shot in a dferent place from where the womens bodies were found, a police source told Reuters.  Danish intelligence said earlier on Thursday that Islamic State could be behind the killings. The video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organisation Islamic State, the Danish intelligence service said in a statement. This is a case of an unusually bestial killing of two totally innocent young women, it said. Before leaving, Jespersen had posted on Facebook about her upcoming trip. Dear friends, Im going to Morocco in December. Any of you guys whos around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal  Compared to other countries in North Africa, Morocco has been largely insulated from militant attacks. The most recent took place in April , when  people were killed in a bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech.

Simple. No excuses. We were miles off it. Aberdeen were stronger and quicker and bullied us.“We were too meek.

Here it is, in full, below.Congratulations on your purchase of Dundee United. I guess the obvious first question is why Dundee United My son Scott and I have been looking for investment in European football for some time. We looked at a lot of dferent options, and we looked at this particular club, the club#s history, the support of the fans, the previous success and rich history.The Irish history appealed because we are of Irish descent. We know the Club had financial issues and that makes it dficult for any Club to be successful.For the Club staff to work within that scenario where there is financial dficulty, you are hampered by that. Decisions are then based on where you are at rather than the best interests of the Club. We felt it was a sleeping giant and we could come in with our advisors and use our business experience to make a dference and get Dundee United back where it needs to be.How much did buying United cost you I will not answer that question directly but what I will say is I have seen some numbers thrown about out there and I wish we were buying it for as little as that! It comes to a combination of money paid to shareholders, money put in for the retirement of debt and a commitment to working capital to ensure funds going forward to do what we need to do to be successful.How long has buying a sporting opportunity in Europe been an interest or passion for you It has been there for several years. Scott#s passion for European football goes back much longer than that. It was his passion that rubbed off on me. His English team is Newcastle United, and we caught a match a few years back and had a lot of fun. In the last year, we really took the interest seriously.Are you looking to make money from this deal Yes. This isn#t a hobby for us, and we expect to make money long-term but, let me say, for that to happen we need to be competing in the Ladbrokes Premiership on a continual basis.How much do you know about Dundee United and Scottish football I know a ton. We spent a tremendous amount of time and money doing our due diligence. Legally, on the business side and on the performance side. We know a lot about Dundee United, and we have researched Scottish football, and we know where we are and where we want to go. We have an excellent plan to get where we want to go.Do you expect to own Dundee United for several years Yes. I expect to own the team long-term.What would you say to reassure Dundee United fans about the long-term future of the Club I guess what I would say is based on the due diligence conducted, spending a lot of time and money researching, we know what we are getting into. This isn#t just a passing fancy where we are going to get in and discover something that would create any issues for us. We are confident about what we are getting into and where we want to go. We would not invest in the Clubwe weren#t convinced about the long-term future of the Club.How does this purchase affect the structure of the Club Mike Martin has stepped down as Chairman, and I would like to recognise the work Mike has done during the process. He is a big fan of the Club, and he has steadied the ship since his appointment in March.As new owners, we are going to take it in a dferent direction. We plan to appoint a Managing Director who will be in charge of running the Club and he will be responsible for the aspects of the commercial and business side of the Club.We will also have a Sporting Director who will be responsible for all the performance aspects of the Club. He will work with Robbie Neilson efficiently and effectively from the Club’s standpoint.We will be making some announcements in the very near future regarding this.What type of Chairman would you describe yourself So I’ll be the Chairman and my son Scott will be the quasi-Vice Chairman. He will sit on the board with me. From a Club perspective, people can expect that I#ll be interested in all that is going on I will be very supportive of what#s going on and who is doing it I will be available whenever, but I will not be a micro-manager. We will have what we think are the right persons in the right positions to be a successful Club and I will absolutely expect results.From a fan perspective, I will be a low profile Chairman and fans will hear more from the Club leadership in the new structure than they will from me.Do you plan to work remotely Yes. I will work remotely and travel over as much as possible. Scott and I have talked about this. We will have board meetings that we will come over for, but we will try to tag-team and come across at separate times, so at least one of us is here as often as possible.How can you get a feel for the Clubyou aren#t over in Dundee With today#s technology it is almost asyou are over there but having the right people in the right positions is what matters. Jimmy Fyffe and David Dorward are still on the board, and we anticipate one or two other people to be on the board from the Dundee area. It is essential for the fans to know we will definitely have local representation and they will be in constant communications.There are American owners at Dundee FC, also within the city. So let me ask this directly. Do you have any plans to merge the clubs No. None whatsoever.Do you have any links at all with the owners of Dundee FC No, I have never met them, and quite frankly I do not even know who they are.Do you have any links to the previous owners of the Club including Stephen Thompson No, I have heard his name, but I have never met or had a discussion with Stephen Thompson. Obviously, I have met Mike Martin and Jimmy Fyffe.You have an interest in a Baseball team. What experience have you gained that will stand you in good stead for a football team based in Dundee I believe firmly, that a person needs to know their limitations. As Chairman and owner that is the situation. As far as performance of the squad aspect of the Club is concerned, I expect to be consulted with, I will be involved and interested in decisions, but in reality, I will defer the main decisions to those that know the game much better than I do. As I said previously, I#m not going to micro-manage. I expect to be much more involved in the business side.Have you spoken to the Head Coach and can you confirm that you see him leading the team forward So when I travelled across recently, I was introduced to Robbie, but quite frankly I don#t even think he knew who I was! I just happened to be a visitor who was introduced. That#s been the extent so far, but in answer to your question, I absolutely do believe he is the man to lead the team forward. He has made a positive impact since his arrival, and he has proven himself with Hearts before.Will he be given financial backing to help in the task of getting the Club back into the Ladbrokes Premiership I guess what I’d say is that it is not an open chequebook, but we absolutely intend to invest the necessary funds to get us into a position to get promoted. Equally important is when we get up we stay there.You will appreciate supporters will be curious and apprehensive about motives. How do you plan to communicate with fans of Dundee United Talk is cheap. What I would say to our supporters is judge us by our actions and, even more importantly judge us on our results. Obviously, due to the structure that I#ve discussed earlier, we will be implementing changes, and the fans will hear from the Club leadership rather than me.What targets do you intend to set for the team and the Club as a whole Let me answer it this way. We are looking at short-term and longer-term targets. The short-term objective is simple # promotion to the Premiership. We expect it is this year absolutely. We need to be United and have the one vision, # success # and get to the Premiership. The timing of the transaction is excellent. We have a transfer window shortly in January, and this will allow us to get with Robbie and figure out the team, andwe need to make some changes, we are ready and willing to do that.Longer-term, maybe three to five years, we need to be competing in the top six of the Premiership. We want to be competing in European competition and challenging in the cups. That#s our ultimate goal."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie csaba laszlo hangover could be costing dundee united","story":"After the disaster of a defeat against Ayr United earlier this month and the frustration of dropping a point at Morton, there were signs Dundee United are getting back on track as they headed to Inverness at the weekend.The Tangerines left the Highlands gnashing their teeth about only taking a point from a game they dominated and should have won.For Robbie Neilson and his players, though, the consolation was they had gone to one of the most dficult away venues in the Championship and stamped their authority and style of play on the proceedings in a way few sides can.That was something they failed to achieve in that - hammering at the hands of the Honest Men and couldn’t maintain as they got dragged into a long-ball slugging bout in Greenock the following week.Those performances led to the manager publicly reminding his players they are at their best when they get the ball down and pass.It even saw him addthat leads to the odd problem from playing the ball out from tight areas instead of taking the easy option and lumping it down the park more in hope than expectation, it was a risk he’d take.Pointing outpasses were completed nine times out of  and long balls only had a - chance of success, it was a case of playing percentage football, his logic was sound.While the second tier is known as a physical league where teams must have the ability to battle and grind out results, there can be little doubt United’s best chance of winning promotion lies in them concentrating on producing good football.And, in fairness, before the recent run of three games without a win, under Neilson United have shown that, once their quality gets them ahead, they’re now a squad that can successfully battle to stay ahead.There is an argument, though, that too much of either and a winning formula will not be found.At Inverness, United kept the ball very well and did create enough chances to win. Star striker Pavol Safranko had three decent chances and one of the gilt-edged iety.All were with his head and, given the Slovakian’s obvious quality, it’s a fair betthe same happens on any other day he’ll get on the scoresheet.On top of that, young Matty Smith also saw an excellent effort miraculously saved by keeper Mark Ridgers, meaning on most occasions this was a game that would have been won.Given their dominance of the ball, however, it’s fair to say United should have created more. That they didn’t might be a hangover from previous boss Csaba Laszlo’s year in charge.Like every manager, Laszlo had his own football philosophy and a big part of it was keeping the ball at all costs.Shortly after taking over, he told his players he’d rather they played the ball all the way back to the halfway line than take a gamble and just send it into the opposition penalty box.While the theory behind that is understandable, it led to his team often passing the opposition to death but too often without creating chances, never mind scoring goals.Particularly in the first half up at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium on Saturday, that problem reared its head again. As the manager touched on in his post-match interview, on a string of occasions when they got the ball into the final third, the chance to get it into the penalty box was passed up in favour of a pass back to a deeper lying team-mate.It might just be that, when in advanced areas, taking a gamble and putting in crosses that give the opposition something to defend would be a more fruitful option."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/ETT_9990.jpg ","title":"two boys 8 knocked down by van near local primary school","story":"Two boys, aged eight, have been knocked down outside a local primary school. vw, px\"   vw, px\"  Police received calls at .pm about an incident close to Invergowrie Primary School.It happened on Errol Road.Police and ambulance crews are on the scene.A spokesperson for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: “We received a call at  hours today to attend an incident on Errol Road in Invergowrie.“We dispatched two ambulances to the scene.”More follows."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

be kept.“Since the start of the month it has become blindingly clear that the Brexit process is a mess and the Prime Minister’s exit deal is clearly doomed.“A people’s vote would put the UK’s citizens

They come in all shapes and sizes. The kind with a vast reception area where teams can mingle before a short trot down on to the pitch. The kind where a long downward stairs leads then to a short burst of five or six steps up on to the playing surface – the stairs often split down the middle by wire mesh so that when testosterone spills over, the worst that can happen is the flinging of insults and the jabbing of fingers rather than the flinging of punches and jabs to the ribs.Mestalla’s player exit to the pitch is extremely tight, only just room for the two sides to stand shoulder to shoulder and, post-match, it’s jam-packed with “stalls” where cameras and reporters from TV stations, who’ve paid hundreds of millions to be there, wait apprehensively to ensure that they get their post-match fill of “flash” interviews.I’m friendly with Michael Carrick, Ander Herrera and Juan Mata – the two Spaniards spotted me and greeted me, respectively, by name and by affectionate nickname . Michael walked past me, in a distraught daze, deeply affected not only by the defeat but by the abject quality of United’s play and the cavalier loss of a chance to top the group and, theoretically, an easier draw for the next round.When he spotted me, now  feet behind him in my interview position, he did a double take, said “Sorry, sorry!” and marched back down the tunnel to shake hands. But he was patently deeply affected. Mourinho  He was, I think in retrospect, not so bothered.Hands in pockets, in decent humour, apparently not affected by what he’d just seen – an evening when, uncharacteristically, he’d not been much for leaping off his team’s bench, yelling at his players or remonstrating with the officials. Very un-Mourinho-like.That evening, several staff, one famous ex-player and my friend Andy Mitten, editor of the United We Stand fanzine, all asked me my opinion of the Portuguese.I used one or two words I can’t repeat here but, without demur, warned them that they’d lose by a couple of goals at Liverpool and that it was long, long overdue that Mourinho be paid some severance and told to take his bile where.There’s more to say about this guy, so much more – something I’ll do this and next week."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie locos look to shut out formartine united in derby clash","story":"Inverurie Locos boss Neil Cooper says his team have to defend better when theyto North Lodge Park tomorrow.The Railwaymen face local rivals Formartine United after being beaten - at Pitmedden on November  in the Highland League Cup.Locos had led - that day before United’s comeback and, after clean sheets in their last three games, Cooper wants to see a better showing at the back than in their last clash with Formartine.He said: “You can learn from every game by taking responsibility and not making mistakes at vital times.“We got ourselves into a - lead and then a minute before half-time we didn’t close down a cross and they scored.“That’s one defensive thing you need to do where you stop crosses coming into the box.“Then once they come into the box you’ve got to defend the cross and that goal gave Formartine a big lt, going in - down at half-time.“Then they got a couple of quick goals after half-time and our boys didn’t handle it very well.“We go there tomorrow and we’ve got to show we are a lot more solid defensively than we were that day.“Any manager will tell you that defensively that you need to work as a unit.“You can’t do things inidually and think it will work in your favour.“Against the top teams,you are together and work collectively as a unit then you can win games against the top teams.”For fth-placed United, tomorrow’s game gives them a chance to move a point above Inverurie in third.Formartine also have three games in hand as they look to record a fourth victory this season against Locos.North Lodge Park player-manager Paul Lawson is hoping for a win to claim the derby spoils.He said: “It’s an opportunity for us and likewise Locos will be looking to stretch their lead on us.“We do have games in hand but you would rather have the points on the board.“The game is about what we do, we respect our opponents and look at the threat they pose.“You can take confidence from the last game because it shows we can create chances and score goals.“But the two goals we lost in that game were disappointing from our point of view and we need to make sure that doesn’t happen.“The - win earlier in the season was very tight, but when we won - earlier in the season we played very well.“We knowwe perform well we can get the results, but they have threats we will have to overcome.“We know it’s going to be a tough game, but you want to win the derby game and for us it’s about getting the three points and for the supporters it’s about bragging rights, so hopefully we can win.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinally is asking for goals this christmas","story":"What Peterhead boss Jim McInally wants for Christmas is to see striker Rory McAllister among the goals.And he has no doubts that the Blue Toon’s Santa will deliver.Talisman McAllister has found the net just once in his last eight games, ahead of tomorrow’s clash with Stirling Albion at Balmoor.The -year-old’s last counter came on December  in the - win over Berwick Rangers.For Buchan boss McInally the ideal Christmas present would be to pick up three points against the Binos and see McAllister get back among the goals.McInally has no doubts about his star attacker and said: “Rory is the least of my worries because he is in such good nick, so fit and training hard.“He is in a place where his attitude is so good, where I just think it’s only a matter of time before he’s back to his best.“In the Berwick game he scored one and could have scored two or three.“If you watched Hibs against Rangers, you saw how a striker, in Alfredo Morelos, can be good without scoring.“But that doesn’t really happen the same with Rory – becauseyou give him chances he will score.”Stirling Albion have been on a decent run of form under manager and former Don Kevin Rutkiewicz.The Forthbank side are unbeaten in six games and have risen to eighth in the League Two table.McInally doesn’t expect an easy game and admits his turkey would taste a little better on Christmas Daythe Blue Toon can win tomorrow.He added: “Kevin has a really good way about him and he has turned things around there and they are one of four or five teams that will improve in January.“It’s silly for people to think league titles are won at this time of the season.“There will be more points shed in the second half of the season because other teams improve.“Of course, Christmas Day will be better and my turkey will taste betterwe win tomorrow.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"tough start for new star boss","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIt was a tough start for new Red Star manager Luke Naisby last Saturday November  when his youthful side went down  #  to Ferguslie in Paisley.Ferguslie took the lead early when Star failed to clear their lines.Star’s best opportunity in the first half fell to Gregor McGeachy but the youngster saw his shot smothered by the home side#s keeper.

The buildings on the main street and the front street just look sad.The front green for years has waited and unfortunately it still waits#this time for the council to clear away debris after a storm.Come on # the place looks bad enough. Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

To be clear, funding for our core services is being cut again.#For Argyll and Bute this increases our estimated funding gap for next year to £ million. This would be a considerable amount at any time, but coming after years of funding cuts already, it will demand particularly dficult decisions to be made.Councillor Aileen Morton, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, added: #This local government budget is extremely disappointing for the council, our residents and communities. The Scottish Government provides around  per cent of councils’ funding so another . per cent reduction will have signicant impact. It means we must focus on what we as a council have a duty to deliver, and reduce the work we do that’s additional to that.#We have to consider, unfortunately, even those services that are valued,they are not a statutory requirement.#Our priority will be as always to make the best possible use of whatever level of funding we receive, We must set our budget in February .

The combination of problems forced the family to live in the bedroom of their house where the damp was less severe.After seven months of negotiating, Gary and Lindsay have moved out of the house into a privately let property close to Oban.At the time ACHA chief executive Alastair McGregor said: ‘The association will provide compensation through our redress policy to Mr Smith for his inconvenience. The association is committed to getting this matter concluded as soon as possible and for Mr Smith and his family to enjoy the facilities in their new home in the very near future.’In a letter to Mr McGregor, Gary said: ‘I am disgusted the way me and my family have been treated. If this is what you call habitable condition I wouldn’t like to see what ACHA classes as inhabitable.’Since the Argyllshire Advertiser published the article, Gary maintains the holes in the side of the building have not been filled, the damp not dealt with, nor has black mould in the bedroom.He said: #When they got someone to look at it he just wanted to plaster over the problem. That won#t solve the damp in the whole house. I guarantee when we leave they#ll just plaster over it and give it to someone .#When asked about the family#s situation and lack of movement on it, Alastair McGregor said: #Once the current tenancy has ended, we will be investigating further to ensure the issues are completely resolved. With respect to the boreholes, this is not work that is incomplete. We are currently carrying out investigations and that is why they are open.#ACHA was not aware of any problems with the property at the point of letting and we would never knowingly let a property which was not wind and watertight.#"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13471434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080918AyrCurrie_09JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club near move","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club near move to new town centre base at Dam Park as they prepare to sell Millbrae homeThe Millbrae men, who top the Tennents Premiership, are in advanced talks to sell their Millbrae home and move to Dam Park in Ayr town centre.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsDam Park could play host to Ayr Rugby Club as soon as  \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBooming Ayr Rugby Club are nearing a deal to sell their Millbrae home and move to the town centre. Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste. Their report says that bags are being ‘inappropriately handled, stored and transported,’ citing instances where they have been thrown into cages or onto the ground, where they “cannot possibly only be handled by the neck” – the agreed safe method of handling such medical waste. Complaints to health bosses also show “blood spillages are often left untreated all day, despite being seen by supervisors”. Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

In recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month. And residents at Girvan Community Council raised questions over the lack of CCTV along Dalrymple Street. Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks. Cllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the Girvan community.

The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

the architects and builders of Abbotsford, and original installers of the Portcullis Gate December , .The Portcullis Gate, made of oak and wrought iron, was designed by Scott between  and , creating a grand entrance for visitors to his home.It remained an integral part of Scotts lsquoconundrum castle.But it had suffered many years of continuing deterioration, reaching the point where conservation was critical to avoid it falling apart.Keith, great-great-grandson of Thomas Smith, was delighted to keep the family connection with the gate and told the invited audience of Abbotsford donors and Friends about the link between theSmith family, Darnick and Abbotsford.Keith said: ldquoAbbotsford is a joy.\"My family and others from Darnick are proud to have played a part in its construction.\"The gates are a tribute to local craftsmen - ancient and modern.Initial plans by The Abbotsford Trust, to replace the old wood and repair the wrought ironwork on the gate, were revised when research by The Scottish Conservation Studio revealed the Portcullis Gate was not a mismatch of wood of ying quality as originally thought, but was in fact all original wood from Scottrsquos time.The project turned into one of conservation rather than replacement.Pippa Coles, Abbotsfordrsquos Gardens Heritage Development Manager, said: ldquoWe are thrilled to see the gate back in position and looking as Scott intended.\"Earlier this year, I read in John Smithrsquos diary that the gate had originally arrived on December , , so I felt it was a fitting date for their , and it was extra special that Keith, Johnrsquos descendant could join us.ldquoWe are very grateful to our funders and donors who made this important conservation project possible.\"We hope visitors to Abbotsford in the New Year, when we reopen in March, will enjoy walking through the grand entrance, just as Scottrsquos guests did nearly  years ago.The skilled restoration work was undertaken by Charles Taylor Woodwork, based in Dalkeith.The gates were removed last December, dried out and then dismantled and recorded before work began.The original wooden frame was badly damaged and has been replaced, while the internal lattice work has been restored by splicing in good wood from the old frame.Despite its name, the Portcullis Gate is hinged and not raised and dropped by a pulley system.It derives its name from its design, which references the style of a portcullis, an image of which is also carved above the gate.Scottrsquos use of this defensive symbol at the main entry to his home suggests that he viewed Abbotsford as a personal sanctuary.The portcullis image was also used by Scott on his personal book bindings in his library, where the symbol is accompanied by the Latin motto Clausus Tutus Ero , signalling Scottrsquos attitude to Abbotsford as a place of safety from the outside world.Due to its symbolic recurrence throughout Abbotsford, the Portcullis Gate is considered by many to be one of the homersquos most important features.It not only serves as an image of grandeur for guests arriving at Abbotsford, but also symbolises Scottrsquos intentions for Abbotsford as a place of retreat from the chaos of the outside world.The gate was so iconic that it was photographed by William Fox Talbot in October,  for his book The Sun Pictures of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"thea-and-thomas-are-the-most-popular-baby-names-in-the-borders","story":"BORDERS parents have gone against the grain when choosing baby names this year.The most popular choice for new-born girls in the region during the past  months is Thea -

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land

train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in

And despite what Irsquove just said about goodwill, I have not one iota of sympathy for Theresa May and her current predicament.Itrsquos interesting, isnrsquot it, how this narrative around feeling sorry for the Prime Minister has grown  The ldquopoor Theresa mantra reached a full head of steam last week, of course, as the extreme Brexiteers in her party finally moved in for the kill with their vote of no confidence, after stalking her for months.In the media coverage during the build-up to Wednesdayrsquos vote, and in the tone of the reaction to her victory, I was struck by the number of folk who went on and on ndash and on - about how sorry they felt for Mrs May.Itrsquos become clear large sections of the public have become increasingly, indeed worryingly, impressed by the Prime Ministerrsquos handling of the Brexit debacle, seeming to view the blank look on her face as a comforting, praiseworthy signal to us, the plebs, that she knows what shersquos doing.Irsquom not fooled for a minuteand neither should you be. Mrs Mayrsquos features are blank not because shersquos brave, but because she lacks either the courage or the will to change course and save the country from the catastrophe we all face.To be clear, this Remain-voting PM is either stupid enough to try and go ahead with a policy that even her own Government says will be massively damaging to the people of this country, or too cowardly to stop it. Which of these chilling realities is worse Like the robot she jokingly impersonated a few months ago at the Conservative Party conference, the Maybot keeps going through the motions of the disastrous, unsupportable deal she has cobbled together. But that joke isnrsquot funny anymore, especially as Mrs May must bear much of the responsibility for the impossible situation she has found herself in over the last weeks and months.:Flag expert: lsquoThe use of the Union Jack has never been so positive in ScotlandrsquoMake no mistake, this is not only a perfect storm but also a crisis of her own making. It was the PM, after all, who came up with the ill-conceived and wrong-headed red lines of the deal without consulting Parliament or even trying to build consensus and bring MPs with her. She has ignored the Scottish Parliamentrsquos objections and resisted every attempt at Westminster to give MPs a say in the process.Mrs May is not a person any of us, the poor so-and-sos who will suffer economically, socially and culturallyshe goes through with this folly, should feel sympathy for.At this crucial point I believe we should extend the hand of Christmas friendship to another isive figure, however: Tony Blair.The former PM has been embracing the sort of leadership and pragmatism Mrs May continues to reject by quietly chinning EU leaders behind the scenes, trying to hammer out a solution to the terrible situation we all find ourselves in. And, since hersquos intelligent and sane as well as extremely well connected, Mr Blair has come up with a sensible and cogent way forward. The catch is, of course, it would require the sort of leap of imagination the current PM seems incapable of.Instead of trying to keep flogging her dead horse, Mrs May should, according to her predecessor, become a facilitator for MPs to decide the next step. If no consensus can be found in Parliament, he justiably backs a public vote to determine whether Brexit should go ahead.Crucially, he also says the EU should ndash and would - make concessions on some of the issues that led to Brexit in the first place, such as free movement, thus allowing some EU doubters to come back into the fold and vote to cancel Brexit. Being seen to listen to concerns over immigration, to offer some flexibility to nation states, would surely be welcomed more widely across Europe, too.Showing uncharacteristic emotion, perhaps sensing hersquos on to something, Mrs May has angrily accused Mr Blair of undermining her talks. Predictably, the Corbyn faithful has also blown a gasket at his intervention Labourrsquos former leader remains the anti-Christ in their eyes because of his decision to involve Britain in the Iraq war.The whole lot of them need to move on, Labour from Iraq and the Tories from their calamitous belief that Brexit can and should happen. Lest we forget Mr Blair, though undoubtedly flawed, was the last politician able to gain the broad support of most people in Britain, regardless of their background or ideology.Hersquos the sort of pragmatic centrist the country is crying out for right now, and over the festive season Irsquoll be praying Mrs May has a Christmas epiphany and follows his lead."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-college-lecturers-back-strike-action","story":"The Educational Institute of Scotland union said  per cent of members from colleges had backed industrial action following a long stand-off over cost of living increases.

Time for him to get tough.Ms Sturgeons reference to nationalisation, meanwhile, went further than stated SNP policy.In its  Holyrood manesto, the SNP said the party would merely ensure a public sector body was able to bid for a future rail contract, when the franchise lapsed.While in last yearrsquos general election manesto, the SNP said its MPs would argue for the devolution of Network Rail to get ldquoa more effective and efficient rail service.Nor is there a reference to rail nationalisation in the  White Paper on Independence.That said that once the current ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper franchises ran out, the government of an independent Scotland would, ldquounder existing European legislation, have the opportunity to consider all options for the delivery of passenger services, including public sector options, but it did not identy nationalisation as one of those options.That was despite stating the Royal Mail would be renationalised after independence.SNP MSPs also voted against a Labour motion backing nationalisation just last month.Scotlandrsquos railways were last fully in public hands more than  years ago.State-owned British Rail ran them from  to .A gradual Tory privatisation then began in  that transferred them to the private sector by .Mr Sturgeonrsquos comment came after she was pressed by the Scottish Tories about the current misery on Scotlandrsquos railways as a result of hundreds of ScotRail cancellations.Acting Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said punctuality was at its worst for  years, there were staff shortages due to training for a winter timetable, and delayed rolling stock.Askedtrain passengers were owed an apology, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoYes, I do.

The deadline for the UK to agree a deal within the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement is Monday January .Mrs May and her colleagues, including David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, have in terms suggested a no-deal Brexit would be ldquochaotic for the UK economy, yet their critics claim - to maximise the chances of Tory, DUP and even some Labour rebel MPs backing her plan ndash they are waiting to the very last moment in a parliamentary game of brinkmanship before accepting, finally, it is dead.As Liam Fox, the Trade Secretary, has already suggested the prospect of a heavy defeat on Mrs Mayrsquos Plan could mean it might never be put to MPs.At this point,a no-deal were indeed ruled out, then the PM would be resigned to having to work with Parliament to put before MPs indicative votes on all the main options. The pressure would be on from the likes of Ian Blackford and Vince Cable to put a Peoplersquos Vote on the menu of choices.After another week of parliamentary rock-throwing, a bizarre twist emerged with none other than Vladimir Putin arguing that a Peoplersquos Vote would be - undemocratic.\"Was there not a referendum  Someone disliked the result, so repeat it over and over  Is this democracy  What then would be the point of the referendum in the first place \" asked the Russian President, who secured a  per cent vote to keep him in the Kremlin.David Miliband, the former Labour Foreign Secretary, intervened to brand Mr Putins comments ldquoan insult to the United Kingdom, suggesting the Russian leaders support for the current Brexit deal only strengthened the case for a rethink."},{"url":null,"title":"lump-of-coal-for-theresa-may-while-santas-unimpressed-by-sturgeon","story":"Now one had to tread carefully. Boys might be girls and girls might be boys or both might be neither. It meant an awful lot more thought, which was dficult for the old man.Thats not quite true, that it was easier then. The best days had been when his main responsibility was a fresh satsuma in the toe of a soft stocking with some little treats that would satisfy any child. A pre-season trip to Japan to collect the fruit had always been a lovely start to celebrations and Mrs Claus adored the bustle of Tokyo after  months of snowy wilderness.The old irritating jingle wasnt quite correct. Mr Claus had very little to do with the compilation of the Naughty Nice lists. Teams of elves performed surveillance on households throughout the year, reporting back to an elven-senate.He had to smile at the reports of parents using him as a method of discipline for boisterous little ones. Didnt the parents know they were being watched too  Such arrogance.Mr Claus had final say-so on which side of the ledger names would fall, checking it twice in that sense, he supposed.The original version of the song included lyrics urging listeners to be charitable towards the less fortunate. These quite rapidly dropped out of circulation. How they could do with being brought back, he thought, as he surveyed the workshops.The elves had ed with stories of banks where hungry families could go to collect parcels of food. They told of people sleeping out on the street because they had no homes to go to.Oh ho, but delivering the Poopsie Unicorn Slime Surprise seemed so frivolous in contrast.\"Remember dear, youre bringing joy to people,\" Mrs Claus would tell him in these moments of reflection. Joy.He quite missed his green suit. Blast that famous cola company and their expert marketing department. Changing his jacket and trousers to red in the s had only served to emphasise the broken capillaries in his nose and cheeks, impossible to avoid when travelling at speed through freezing air. Sitting for long stretches didnt help the circulation either.But even Santa was no match for early th century capitalism and, with the ever present risk of being spotted creeping by a Christmas tree, it was simpler to match peoples expectations than cleave to the truth.The truth was he was fearful of the future.There had always been ups and downs but usually the Naughty Nice ledgers contained a healthy mixture of political leaders. Each Christmas Eve he slipped down the chimney of No, careful to avoid that blasted Chief Mouser trying to claw the pom pom from his hat, to leave a little gt for whoever was in charge.This year, an event that pained him to think of, he had been forced to open the Coal Cellar. Much as the word Macbeth is never uttered in theatrical circles, the Coal Cellar is never named. The black, hard lump of carbon was waiting to be loaded on to his sleigh.The elves had all refused to touch it and Rudolph was threatening a strike. Superstitious bunch, reindeer. What had to be done, had to be done. If he only showed strong and stable leadership, the deed would be complete and the coal loaded.But to what reward  He felt like giving Bute House a swerve this year too.On a personal level, Christmas Eves to come were looking to be miserable affairs. Minimum pricing would likely put paid to the nice drams he enjoyed in the more upmarket homes. He was fond of a Macallan, it made the cold night cosier, but he suspected soft drinks would replace the neat nip once the legislation came in.Of course, the sugar tax would likely see off even a ginger beer. It would be a glass of water and the humans better watch out for the resulting blue ice, hadnt they Sweeping restrictions on sugary and fatty foods would likely limit the mince pies on offer. For the love of Krampus, he better not be expected to share a carrot with the team.But all that washe would be able to enter British air space at all. He shuddered as he thought of the old days of visas. Next year the bringing of joy would be dependent on queues at Dover,joy could be found amidst economic collapse, of course.Prancer and Dancer claim their grandfather hailed from peatland in the Shannon basin and were confident of an EU passport. He hadnt the heart to tell them that reindeer became extinct in Ireland  years ago, so the connection was likely too tenuous to count. There would be time yet for that conversation.In the distance sleigh bells were being lightly lted by a fine wind. He felt very tired. He surveyed the waiting empty Naughty Lists, stockpiled for next year on the advice of his Special Advising Elves.\"Merry Christmas to all,\" he muttered. \"And to all, good bloody luck.\""},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-nicola-sturgeon-is-right-positives-of-immigration-outweigh-negatives","story":"The problem was that her views were always exactly what happened at the time to be official SNP policy, while competitive debating required the speaker to make the case for whatever side of the motion she had been given.That kind of debating, in the chamber of the GUU or the Oxford Union, is often characterised as play-acting, which is what it was. Even so, it was more useful and instructive as a rehearsal for real le than actual student politics, as conducted by the Studentsrsquo Representative Council or the National Union of Students, which was iniably a kind of gestural Corbynism avant la lettre.Thatrsquos because debate ndash precisely because it is pretence, and not necessarily what you actually believe ndash requires the participants to think critically about the arguments for both sides of the proposition, and be ready to counter objections. When Irsquove said, as I often have, that the First Minister seldom provides any indication of what could be called thinking, I donrsquot mean that shersquos thick, or doesnrsquot consider her strategic options, but that she doesnrsquot habitually engage in that kind of critical evaluation.That, of course, may make her a more effective practical politician. But it gives me pause whenever she says something with which I wholeheartedly agree, as she did the other day. Emerging from Downing Street, where shersquod given the Prime Minister a bottle of Misty Isle gin from Skye for Christmas, she expressed the opinion that the Governmentrsquos immigration policy was ldquoan act of vandalism on Scotlandrsquos economy and public services.Economically, itrsquos straightforwardly empirical: immigration contributes more to the Scottisheconomy than it costs ndash much more. And while Ms Sturgeonrsquos claim that a  per cent reduction in EU migrants would send Scotlandrsquos population into decline and that forecasts suggest a reduction of  per cent is, like all claims about the future, unveriable, it seems plausible.I also entirely agree with her opinion that most immigrants enrich society in ways that may be less obviously measurable in economic terms but may be, for all that, more important. Irsquom thinking mainly of food and music, but you can draw up your own set of cultural priorities.Yet, rather than congratulate myself and Ms Sturgeon on our enlightened opinion, which is clearly the right one, anyone seeking to make that case should ask: what are the objections to this view  Andthey donrsquot seem obvious, why on earth doesnrsquot everyone agree with me Willingness or ability to do that ndash notably on the issues of independence and Brexit ndash seems to be in short supply. But plenty of reasons could be advanced to counter the First Ministerrsquos pronouncements on immigration, however much I may agree with them.The first, and cheapest, is that the proposals drawn up by the Westminster Government are, in general, almost exactly the same as those given in Scotlandrsquos Future, the independence White Paper published in . It too advocated parliamentary control of immigration, robust border controls, a points-based system, assessment of skills, the repatriation of failed asylum seekers, and all the rest of it. It even proposed to dictate which area of the country people could settle in. But to point this out is merely to attack Ms Sturgeon for inconsistency with the stated policies of the party she leads.A politicianmaking all the hay she can out of Brexit, when every point she raises ndash from the legitimacy of a referendum to the dficulty of disentangling laws, or the case for customs unions to unrealistic claims about future prosperity ndash could as easily be applied to independence, is not going to be held back by a little thing like that. In any case, I suppose the SNP could revise its policies in line with what the First Minister says.Whatrsquos trickier is persuading those who donrsquot share the liberal view of the benefits of immigration. The First Minister doesnrsquot subscribe to the economic justication I would advance, which is that ndash as with most things ndash the market is a better regulator of immigration than government and that any fixed targets are counter-productive.Opponents of immigration can be defeated on most economic arguments, because theyrsquore demonstrably wrong. Immigrants arenrsquot a cost to the welfare system, and there are sectors of the economy, including agriculture, catering and the NHS, to which they are crucial. Even the claim that immigration holds down the wages of the poorest is an argument for it as a boon to the economy in general, though not one that anyone left of centre cares to advance.Much of the hostility to immigration, however, has more nebulous causes. Some of it, alas, is simply racism or prejudice, which should always be challenged. But the historical reluctance of politicians to address the subject, assuming that it is always nothing but bigotryis in large part what has inflamed public opinion.Cultural concerns can be real without being racist. Schools where many children speak English as a second language face challenges and costs which, with adults whose grasp of English is poor, also affect the courts and social services. Radical Islamists are a tiny subset of British Muslims, but the danger they present is alarming. The treatment of women by some immigrant communities is at odds with British values, and sometimes laws. The same can be true of drinking habits, or ldquostreet culture.The natural tendency of people to settle in areas where others from their country of origin already live can lead to a placersquos character changing markedly . The refusal of the authorities to take complaints about that seriously can lead to social breakdown. The First Minister need look no further than Govanhill, in her own constituency.I, and I assume Ms Sturgeon, believe that the benefits of immigration, cultural and economic, outweigh these objections. But they deserve more than a glib soundbite and a few tweets. Itrsquos futile to pretend that they are not there, or that they will go away without doing some hard thinking and having a genuine debate."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-corbyn-furore-should-not-obscure-the-fiasco-of-mays-shoddy-brexit-tactics","story":"Caught on the Commons camera, Jeremy Corbyn clearly made a discourteous comment under his breath. Only those on either side of him might have heard what he said and even then the noise in the Commons might have drowned him out. Words, voiced virtually silently and in frustration, were joyously and opportunistically seized upon by screen-watching Conservatives to lambast the Labour leader and to exact retribution on Speaker Bercow, one of their pet hates.This smokescreen of ersion has deflected attention away from the major concerns of that Commons sitting, where the PM used the insalubrious tactics of threatening a No Deal Brexit in her attempts to create momentum for her apology for a Withdrawal Agreement.In addition, more controversy has been thrown into the mix with Mr Corbynrsquos denial that he did in fact speak the words attributed to him by professional lip readers.Theresa May can remain aloof from this gigantic storm in a teacup but undoubtedly she will quietly revel in Mr Corbynrsquos discomfiture.What I would like to ask is which one of us has not uttered silently words of the type, attributed to Mr Corbyn, in moments of sheer frustration  It is only a pity that Mr Corbyn may have compounded the errorindeed he did utter those words, by his denial. Even the words he claims to have voiced, though far from misogynistic , were surely unparliamentary.Denis Bruce, Rannoch Gardens, Bishopbriggs.JEREMY Corbyn denies calling the Prime Minister ldquostupid woman, which watching on TV is what I thought he muttered quite clearly. Outside the Westminster bubble it may look to be simply a storm in a teacup, but it is important as it does involve the believability of the word of a potential Prime Minister. He maintains instead that he said ldquostupid people, which can only mean all thosefacing him on the opposite benches.In the Commons Mr Corbyn is referred to as ldquothe Right Honourable gentleman, and as such we are expected to accept his denial, the implication of which was that he was not criticising the Prime Minister, despite the fact that she was sitting directly facing him and she was the only person with whom he had just been involved in heated debate. More generally,the term ldquostupid woman is unacceptable in the Commons, in these days of equality why is ldquostupid people not also unacceptable as apart from anything  it includes women as well as men Alan Fitzpatrick, Solomonrsquos View, Dunlop.SUGGESTING someone is a stupid woman isnrsquot necessarily misogynistic.

If they had been schoolboys they would have had a detention lasting over the Christmas holidays.We also have the Prime Minister demanding that the SNP MPs back her Brexit plan in the Commons when a large majority of the Scottish electorate voted Remain. Her demands simply show she has lost the plot and simply does not know where to turn for support for her feeble plan.Unfortunately, the Scottish people are the ones who are going to suffer when with the latest farce of an attempt of an immigration policy means we will be short of staff in our NHS, care homes, hospitality and farming.

And so are the two dominant consonants in ldquopeople the unvoiced ldquop used to begin the word and in the central phoneme ndash both words have similar dominant labial consonants.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.

The appeal ends at the end of the year.Donations forms have been published in The Orcadian over the appeal, with donations also accepted online at: www.gofundme longhope-leboat-museumThe trust can also be contacted via email: longhope@gmailcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Most cash was paid to Scottish wind farms, with some earning more than £m a month for not supplying power.Whitelee and its extension on the outskirts of Glasgow, the biggest onshore wind farm in the UK, has received almost a fth of the entire pot since , with payments totalling more than £m to date.Meanwhile, the MW Clyde scheme, near Abington in South Lanarkshire, has raked in more than £m and the Grfin, near Aberfeldy in Perthshire, nearly £m. The amount paid out has been rising annually, despite a new transmission cable to export power from Scotland south of the Border.The fees, known as constraint payments, are paid for by households across the UK.Anti-wind campaigners say spending on constraints has got “completely out of control”, and described expansion of the industry as “reckless”.Lyndsey Ward, who lives in the Highlands, said: “The constraints situation is completely out of control. The Scottish Government is recklessly approving more and more turbines to be connected to a grid that has little hope of managing any power they produce. “The result is an ever-increasing number of turbines have to be switched off and it is the consumer who pays. “Industry also has the wind costs on their energy bills and they add that on to the goods and services they sell us.” The £. billion Western Link interconnector, which became operational last year, runs  miles underwater from Hunterston in Ayrshire to Connah’s Quay in North Wales.It was hoped by exporting power to England and Wales the cable would cut levels of compensation paid to energy firms when Scottish turbines have to be shut down because supply outstrips demand.But faults have seen the cable – a joint project between network operators National Grid and Scottish Power Transmission – unable to operate at full capacity until last month.So far there seems no reduction in payouts compared to the same time last year.Dr John Constable is director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity which first exposed constraint payments to wind generators and publishes data on the costs.He said: “No-one expected the Western Link to be a complete solution to wind power constraint costs, but the continuing level of payments is strikingly high – £m in November, £.m in December so far – raising the question as to whether this very expensive interconnector represents value for money.”Energy regulator Ofgem approved the Western Link project following a cost-benefit analysis that showed it would reduce consumer bills.A spokeswoman for National Grid said: “The Western Link project is playing a vital role in reinforcing the existing UK transmission system … The project is in the early days of operation but will signicantly reduce the levels of constraint payments being made to wind generators.” A spokesman for Ofgem added: “Ofgem sets National Grid, as electricity system operator, strong financial incentives to manage constraint costs efficiently. Overall these costs are less than  per cent of a typical household electricity bill.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847378.1545391589!/image/image.jpg","title":"funding injection for smart central heating project","story":"East Lothian-based thermal energy storage specialist Sunamp and energy supplier OVO have secured seven-figure funding to develop a commercially viable smart central heating system.The project brings together OVO’s intelligent energy management , called VCharge, with Sunamp’s super compact “heat batteries” which are said to store four times more heat than hot water tanks of a similar size.The firms have received £. million of grant funding from the UK government’s Low Carbon Heating Technology Fund for their collaborative zero carbon home project.Andrew Bissell, chief executive of Macmerry-based Sunamp, said: “It’s a fact that  per cent of energy used in UK homes is for heating and we are delighted to team up with the UK’s leading independent energy supplier and bring our UniQ heat batteries together with OVO’s Time of Use technology.“We aim to develop an accessible heating solution to deliver heating and hot water on demand and improve levels of comfort and lower fuel costs, energy consumption and carbon emissions in homes everywhere.”Toby Ferenczi, director of strategy at OVO, said: “Replacing a gas boiler with a smart electric system is the most practical and low-cost way to decarbonise heating.“By combining VCharge and Sunamp’s UniQ heat batteries, power can be drawn down according to the needs of the grid, resulting in running costs comparable to gas heating systems but without carbon emissions.“We are excited to work with Sunamp to develop this game-changing smart electric heat solution.”Energy and clean growth minister Claire Perry said: “By replacing fossil fuels with smart heating systems we have the potential to cut carbon emissions and save consumers money on their heating bills.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845909.1545392181!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith the art of writing christmas letters","story":"If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly in seasonal letters to friends and family, writes Alexander McCall Smith.It is December once more – an observation of considerable triteness, but one of unchallengeable accuracy. This is a month noted for its joie de vivre, bonhomie and what the German language, with typical economy, calls Weinachteneinkäuferwartung . It is signicant, perhaps, that the English language has no specic noun for the state of mind that settles on many of us during this special month. This state is marked by a niggling desire to get away – anywhere – in order to escape the state of mind that appears to affecting others.For some, the first appearance of Christmas lights is the signal that things are about to go downhill. In Edinburgh, this happens now in September, immediately after the Edinburgh Festival. This is in accordance with the desire of our local tourism promoters – a couthie lot – to inflict festivals on the long-suffering inhabitants of this city  , as the expression has it, and, indeed,  . For this, many feel they should be awarded  . But that is another subject, and it is too depressing to talk about it in a month during which we are all so spontaneously cheerful. The Reverend I.M. Jolly we most certainly are not.However, one feature of December that is genuinely enjoyable is the Christmas letter that people like to send their friends and relatives round about now. These are wonderful things to receive, and who does not feel a certain disappointment when they open a Christmas card and find that it contains nothing but good wishes for Christmas and the New Year  There is no point in sending others such thin fare: of course they have such wishes for you, and it would be odd,not actually hurtful,they were not to harbour such thoughts. By contrast, finding a cyclostyled letter within is a bonus, and sets the heart racing with anticipation.: Alexander McCall Smith: Edinburgh Airport should charge people to sit downAn important thing to understand about these letters is that they give an opportunity to boast, usually about one’s offspring. Usually this involves exam results, which form, on average, about half the content of a Christmas letter. When it comes to Highers and A levels and such things, people have no shame in trumpeting them loudly in the seasonal letter. Indeed, I have heard that the SQA, which controls exam results, is seriously thinking of withholding their release until December each year in order to ensure their topicality for Christmas letters. This is a helpful suggestion, although it may complicate university admission, which of course is another very fitting topic for the Christmas letter.What you should do in this respect is mention exam results indirectly. Don’t say Jane got nine As in her exams this year. That is clearly boastful and in bad taste. Rather, you should write, “Janeis still a bit worried about her university admission. I have assured her that anyone who gets nineA grades in her Advanced Highers has no need to worry, but does she listen to me  You know how children are!” Other family achievements should not be forgotten, and should all be referred to in a good Christmas letter. Once again, insert the information indirectly, as in this example: “We all went to Rome this year and had a wonderful time. The Pope looks so much younger, you know, when you see him close up. I mean, really close up, in his private study.” That conveys, in a very tactful way, the message you wish to convey. Then you might add, “We were a bit nervous of course, as this is the first time that we have had a direct experience of the beatication of a close relative . But it was such a simple, rather moving ceremony and we had a lovely dinner afterwards in a modest trattoria ...”: Alexander McCall Smith: Time to wake up and smell Europa’s coffee If you received an OBE or similar award this year, do not mention it directly. The following form of words will suffice: “We couldn’t get away in July, as planned, as I had to go down to London– just for the morning – what a bind!” If you went to the Garden Party, then the only way of conveying that information is to say something like this: “My goodness, it was a battle getting into my morning suitin July. There I was enjoying my statutory cucumber sandwich under the gaze of Arthur’s Seat, thinking of the strict diet ahead!” No more than that is necessary.All heavy colds and injuries must be mentioned. The attachment of a small photograph of an X-ray plate is optional. That, believe it or not, really was in a Christmas letter we received a few years ago. The fracture was an interesting one.

The highest number of points held by a driver still on the road is .“Almost  drivers with  points or more on their record are still on Scotland’s roads,” Mr Rumbles said.“For the safety of everyone driving home for Christmas it’s important that repeat offenders and wild drivers are kept off the roads.“It’s possible that there are mitigating factors in some cases which justy these drivers hanging on to their right to drive.

The number of EU nationals coming to work in the UK will fall by an estimated  per cent, seen as particularly acute for Scotland which needs migration to maintain the workforce and keep the population growing. The Scottish Government has already published “catastrophic” estimates about the impact of a  per cent drop, Mr Russell said.“An  per cent drop would be impossible to imagine” he told Holyrood’s Europe committee.“It would throw the economy into complete chaos.”CBI Scotland has already hit out at the prospect of “draconian” blocks on overseas workers, while the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Institute of Directors, National Farmer’s Union, Federation of Small Businesses and Universities Scotland have also hit out at the plans.Mr Russell described the scheme as “wrong morally.” “Many of us take this as a personal affront as to how the world will see us - we’re not like this,” he said.The Scottish Government is making representations to Westminster on this with an “alternative in mind.”He said: “Clearly independence is the best alternative, but we have long argued for a devolved approach to migration.“I remember having a conversation with [former UK Brexit Secretary] David Davis about this when he was in office and pointing out the great advantage of devolving migration because you can then set whatever targets you wanted in the rest of the UK.“But we could actually meet the needs of what we have by ensuring that we had the best approach to it.“It is an approach that exists in the Canadian provinces, it’s an approach that exists in parts of Australia. It is not dficult to manage.“I think in all these circumstances it’s time has come and I think these bodies are moving towards it.” The CBI has shted it’s objection from one of principal to “the timing” of such a transfer of power, Mr Russell said.“That is a short-term solution prior to independence which is putting in place a devolved system of migration.”Meanwhile, the UK government announced yesterday that the post-Brexit settlement scheme for EU nationals will enter its first public testing phase next month, So far the online application  has been restricted to people in specic professions. From  January, it will be opened up to EU nationals who are living in the UK and who have a passport, as well as their non-EU family members with biometric residence cards.While the expansion will substantially widen the pool of people able to apply to confirm their post-Brexit immigration status, the Home Office said that the scheme would still be in a testing phase ahead of the full launch in March.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4847704.1545409157!/image/image.jpg","title":"why should mps get free tv licences but not britain s over 75s","story":"MPs have just begun their -day parliamentary recess and, while many of them will still be working hard for their constituents over the Christmas break, they do, like the rest of us, deserve a holiday. But what may seem surprising to some voters is that, amid the row over the funding of free TV licences for the elderly, it has emerged that MPs are themselves entitled to claim the cost of a licence from the taxpayer. Of course, they don’t all claim the perk and in the context of the billions of pounds of public money the Treasury spends every year, the total of £, clawed back by the  MPs who did claim it, on top of other office expenses, is a drop in the ocean.But among those who claimed are the culture secretary Jeremy Wright, whose brief covers the BBC, and his predecessor Karen Bradley.: David Gauke hints he would quit Cabinet under no-deal BrexitAnd at a time when the over-s face losing their free TV licences, this will seem out of step with the mood of the country.MPs receive salaries of nearly £, a year, well above the national average, and can claim for legitimate office expenses.The row has erupted because the Government is, from , passing over responsibility for funding free TV licences for the over-s – which costs £ million a year – to the BBC. The corporation is understandably looking at ways to fund this huge sum, at a time when its commercial competitors like Netflix can outspend the BBC on lavish productions.I personally think the £. a year cost of a TV licence is incredible value for money on the basis of even a handful of series in this year alone – such as Bodyguard, The Little Drummer Girl and Killing Eve.So when it comes to the crunch in , we TV viewers have a choice – do we want to pay an above-inflation rise in our TV licence to carry on subsidising it for free for the over-s, or do we accept that the BBC has to, under duress from the Conservative government, either raise the age threshold to, say, , or start charging wealthier pensioners  If we want the BBC to continue to produce award-winning programmes and news, it has to be funded somehow.It is a tough choice, but a huge increase in the cost for all TV licence payers would amount to a regressive tax on those on the lowest incomes, while the wealthiest over-s would continue to be unaffected.In this context, the first step must be for MPs to surrender their own TV licence freebie.It is nearly a decade since the expenses scandal humbled Parliament and forced our representatives to be more frugal with our money.They receive salaries of nearly £, a year, well above the national average, and can claim for legitimate office expenses.But we are not only ten years on from the expenses scandal, but ten years into a tough economy.The ongoing stalemate over Brexit may have stolen parliamentary and government hours from other urgent business, but the country is struggling to support its poorest. Universal credit reforms are hurting those most in need, social care remains one of the biggest challenges the nation faces and yet ministers cannot find the time to deal with it, and homelessness is at crisis levels – the death of a homeless person on the literal doorstep of Parliament this week underlining yesterday’s shocking figures that  people died on the streets last year.So much of politics is about perception and it is time for MPs to make this small sacrice.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing. The bans, which were pretty lenient in any case, should stay. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"watch olympic star brings message for young swimmers ","story":"Two-time Commonwealth champion and triple Olympian swimmer Hannah Miley was in Lerwick todayto lend her support to a programme which aims to raise the standard of swimming in Scotland.The Scottish swim star took to the pool alongside youngsters from Sound Primary School and the Anderson High School as pupils were given an opportunity to learn from her expertise.The Learn to Swim programme is delivered locally by Shetland Recreational Trust, one of  organisations to sign up to Scottish Swimming#s framework which hopes to produce safe and confident swimmers.During her visit to the isles Miley will also be presenting the gong for sportsperson of the year at this evening#s Shetland Sports Awards.She said: #The message that I#m here today for is to basically get kids involved in swimming# it#s a skill that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.#Enjoying being around water and also being safe around water is the main point and just allow them to have fun, enjoy the social side and enjoy getting fit and healthy and just seeing where it will take them.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Give us a vote and I will vote with my head and my heart for Shetland to be clear of da lot a dem, EU, UK and Scotland all running massive deficits. We wid certainly be much better aff.Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     Propaganda rules okPutting the culture issue Ali ducks aside I don’t get why pulling sovereignty when it is helpful is a problem, be that in the EU or even when accepting WTO rules which, guess what, weren’t written singlehandedly by her majesty’s government. Lisbon moved us to majority rule in a partnership of friendly nations. So what Perhaps the problem to following mutually beneficial accept-some-trade-off rules set by the collective group is where you fear your culture dfers, so again I am wondering what part of European culture Ali fears and   or rejects. Eating snails asideI’ve always felt the UK is an appreciated part of mainstream European culture. There is a joint love of family, films, bevvy and football, eating out a bitpossible, a law abiding appreciation of the need for democracy, free speech, free press etc. Fondness of folktales and music, poetry, song, literature, dance and even opera unite people across national boundaries. Again, what is Ali’s problem Leaving the EU will be bad for jobs, farming and the NHS and we don’t know what the deals will bring to fishing or trade. Vive la dference and long live the similarities. I think your own bigotry is shinning through Peter, You talk about pooling sovereignty on one hand while labeling the English bigots. You say one thing while meaning another will you be standing for office soon A few thoughts, not for the first time have we, in Britain, find ourselves alone with Europe united against us and the will of our people. Not for the first time in our history has our position looked bleak with hard times being promised to come. We are being bullied by a cabal of bureaucratic nonentities answerable to no one who would try and isolate and distance us from our Commonwealth friends. Our Sovereignty and independence being undermined and the will of our people being ignored and denigrated. Contrary to some misinformed views, I and many like me, welcome selective immigration from Europe but not at the expense of our Commonwealth friends, whatever their colour and Creed. I welcome open Borders in Ireland just as they were long before the EU ever existed.We have stood alone before and always overcome adversity however grave. IfJunker and the cabal running the EU will not negotiate and remain intransigent, sneering and neo-bellicose It is time to stand tall and give them the two-finger salute, not just the Churchilian one.Heavens Ian, I wis imagining a violin accompaniment.We cant feed our bairns sovereignty Ian, even the Bank of England agrees that we are going to be worse off.A self-made economic disaster.Let them eat cake.Really Ian, “bullied”   Surely Theresa May said her deal was a “good deal”.There is such a thing as reading too manyeditorials. Last one I read saw Ian’s “bureaucratic nonentities” blasted for removing the right of the honest Brit to buy a lawnmower so loud it could deafen you. How very dare the EU protect UK consumers Does Ian imagine Claude Junker doesn’t speak for the elected leaders of the remaining EU nation states, but that rather they march to his tune  Lamentable.The remain member states are naturally protecting the interests of their citizens, including those of the Republic of Ireland, who are in the worlds largest trading block, which is conveniently on our doorstep.The Commonwealth ties however are lose, with distant nations who urged Britain to Remain. The EU block will secure better trade deals with those nations faster by dint of size and relevance.British diplomacy has never succeeded by cutting off our nose to spite our face.Perhaps we should learn from the Nordic foreign minister who quipped last week that there are two types of countries in Europe: small ones and small ones that don’t realise they are small.Has the question really been answered as to why the Tories, gave us this referendum to leave the EU in the first place,it was not going to be in their favour, despite the fact much of our business is with the EU What hidden agenda do the Tories have that they are not telling us###..until it is too late Have we all become xenophobic and argumentive about the pro#s and con#s of the EU, and the need to # fly the flag # as a weak demonstration of nationalityor Britishness, said very, very loosely   It seems very much we are playing right into the hands of the Tories, and singing their song to their beat.What has brought this on other than a narrow vision and not looking at the bigger picture    Brexit only means one thing, and this one thing is for the Tories to benefit for themselves no matter how you look at it.I would prefer to be as part of the EU, instead of being outside it, looking in.It is as simple as that.Of come off it Ali! I have never once labelled all English people as being bigots, nor would I. English nationalist bigots are bigots by definition of being bigots. It’s a bit like a numpty being a numptythat helps.Great attempt at ersion Ali, but just what, or should it be which, is your “abhorrent” cultural problem exactly  It can’t be this hard to specy the culture s you abhore surely, be they mainland, Scottish, UK mainland, continental or from further afield No man is an island Ali, unless perhaps you moved a little northwards and changed your name to Forvik, but you might need to borrow a little cash from somewhere at that stage to build a hospital lest you ever get poorly. Heaven knows who would staff it though, when you are happy to say some cultures are abhorrent to you but won’t specy which.Last I checked you can’t train as a doctor at Shetland College, the NAFC or in a night class in Hamnavoe or Walls, so I guess we will be needing other folk from other parts and other cultures for some time to come. Maybe try to get over it Mr. Shetland-wid-be-much-better-aff-clear-of-da-lot-of-dem, EU-UK-and-Scotland.I do not know exactly what it is Peter, but your first paragraph reminds me of ##.. Is not worth noticing. lolHo ho ho! Glad you are laughing David 🙂I’m with you on the real agenda behind Brexit not being immediately obvious btw.I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.They don’t need the EU to guarantee their human rights. They have holidays aplenty and investments in so many places that using the NHS is as alien to them as using public transport.They have uncharitably driven their agenda to the fore against the better instincts of one nation Tories and have done so using decades of media manipulation and dispicable xenophobic dog whistle messages on immigration.Thankfully as I write the Shaddow Home Secretary is advocating for an “efficient, fair and non-discriminatory migration policy” that is conducive to the UK’s economic interests. Something to wish for in the New Year.I take your points, Peter. It will be interesting how the Tories will drive their immigration policies and whether or not it bends more towards the USA than to this of the EU, after March next year One of the largest industries which depend on EU workers is in the hospitality industry, even here in Shetland there is a large EU workforce, not only in the hospitality industry, but the fishing processing industry as well.It will be interesting how the Shetland economy will cope after March .As for human rights, I question the validity of as to what will be used and what will be discarded in terms of either British or European Human Rights. I fear workers rights may be diminished and favoured more towards the employer than the employee     We shall see If the UK becomes # the cheap workforce of Europe # this may stir up resentment within the working ethos or political change##.before it is too late    We are in unchartered waters, and there could be stormy sea#s ahead. I just hope the changes are for the better of the collective rather than for the few    #I think the big picture is that there are some rich and powerful people in the UK wanting to shackle the UK to USA workers rights and health care in order to benefit from lower taxes after Brexit.# O dear dear me, it is all a wicked capitalist conspiracy.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Aimee-Fewell-4-Auchtertyre-primry.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities. It features a youth leadership project and has a youth committee.Amie Mott, centre based youth worker for the Education Authority told theeveryone was excited for the opening.She said: The refurbishment is really lovely, and was greatly needed.“The young people have been using this building for  years so the enhancement was definitely needed.“In fact, some of the young people who are currently using the centre have told us their parents actually used it years ago, so in a lot of cases we are actually working with the second generation of Ballykeel young people!”Amie concluded by stressing the imporance and relevance of the centre to the community.She said: This is an important facility in the heart of Ballykeel, and we hope the new facilities will encourage even more young people to use the building.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

Paul is well known in the area and I have no doubt will work for the people and will deliver on his promises.“Paul is young man who has gained experience for Jeffrey Donaldson MP. I would urge the people of Dromore to vote for Paul, who is a local candidate and someone who has delivered on many issues for the people of the area.”Mr. Stewart meanwhile, hailed Mr. Martin’s endorsement as a further boost for his campaign.“William Martin was a respected member of Banbridge District Council for  years,” he said. “I am delighted that the former Ulster Unionist Councillor is giving me his full support and assistance for the election on  February.“William had become totally frustrated with the ineptitude of the UUP. His decision illustrates the continuing growth of the DUP we now represent mainstream Unionist opinion.”Mr. Stewart said his election to Banbridge council would further strengthen “the voice of the largest and most effective team on the Council”.He added, “A larger DUP presence would allow us to deliver more for the ratepayers and assist us in our efforts to preserve the symbols of our British identity and fight for the lowest possible district rates.“For years Unionism suffered as the result of splits and ision.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

asked for their story to be told – from beginning to end,” Ms Jones said. “It is done sensitively, but they were five guys in a band, on the road together, so there is humour too.”Double celebrations

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast to gatwick passengers told to check friday flight info ryanair reroutes all flights to stansted","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What does that tell you \"Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border wont happen.\"The notion that its necessary to have a border and checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is an utter con trick.\"Even the Dublin authorities in its no-deal plans admitted no checks on goods at the border.\"Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the border was not addressed in his Governments contingency plan in the event of a no-deal Brexit because the backstop was the only solution.\"For us to be giving signals that theres any other way this could be solved would be foolish,\" he added.Mr Coveney reiterated that in the absence of a backstop and a Brexit deal, preventing physical border infrastructure in Ireland would be \"dficult and involve hard choices\".But he said it would not be helpful for a document, which runs to more than  pages, to be \"dominated by that border debate\".Speaking yesterday, the Taoiseach said the draft agreement currently tabled by Prime Minister Theresa May was the key to avoiding physical infrastructure on the border.\"We are not preparing for a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,\" Mr Varadkar said.\"We have made no preparations whatsoever for physical infrastructure or anything like that.\"We certainly do not want it to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\"The Irish Government has unveiled contingency plans to cope with a potential no-deal Brexit, identying affected sectors which would require up to between  and  pieces of new legislation.The no-deal plans include the purchase of land at ports to prevent congestion from new customs.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the \"robust action by the Irish Government is a stark indication of the serious chaos ahead\".\"This action rightly highlights that the island of Ireland will be disproportionately impacted by Brexit, leaving Northern Ireland sharing a land border with another EU state despite myths peddled by Brexiteers, this leaves Ireland in a very precarious position,\" he said.\"These plans, in contrast to the weak technical papers issued by the British Government and the absence of any action from Stormont, at least acknowledge the state of affairs as they are. \"But regardless of where we are post-March , the backstop must be in place to protect the future interests of people here.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said it was not surprising Dublin had produced the plan. \"We are rapidly hurtling towards a no-deal Brexit and such an outcome would be felt just as acutely in many sectors of the Republic as it would here,\" he said.\"For the last two-and-a-half years the negotiators on both sides have brought us to this ridiculous situation and as a result were now less than  days from an economic precipice. Every preparatory step that can be taken must now be taken.\"Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said the warning signs were there that no-deal would be an \"economic disaster\" and there was now growing concern in the business community.\"The Prime Ministers draft withdrawal deal is in no way perfect, but it is definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal,\" he said.\"Those who oppose it have not set out a viable plan B. MPs need to back this dea, or we face the prospect of economic instability.\"Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill has told Secretary of State Karen Bradley that the Westminster Brexit debate \"has descended into farce and pantomime\"."},{"url":null,"title":"dups emma pengelly reminds academic she has arts degree from ulster university","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Labour will try to force Brexit vote before Christmas  Bertie Ahern: Ireland cant give an inch on avoiding hard border  Blair: May is irresponsible to try and steamroller her deal through The routes are understood to include country lanes, private roads, rights of way across private lands and other unmarked access points leading into Northern Ireland that could be potential smuggling routes.The highly sensitive work was conducted by members of the Defence Forces, working with gardai. It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland civil service ramping up planning for nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was found by a dog walker in a hedge near Seaford, Co Down, on Sunday. Editors viewpoint: Dedication of animal rescue centres is to be admired He was so saturated with rainwater that he had to undergo emergency treatment and was still on a drip yesterday at The Doghouse Sanctuary, Banbridge.Another dog, Herbie , was found straying and in a neglected state. The merle collie looked glum, dirty and had matted fur when he was rescued on September  and taken in by The Rainbow Rehoming Centre in Eglinton.Due to his numerous health problems - including partial sight and hearing, and arthritis in his back legs - his affectionate manner is often overlooked by visitors.Butthese animals have pulled on your heartstrings, the message echoed by the shelters is that \"a dog is for le, not just for Christmas\".Green Party leader Clare Bailey said: \"A dog or pet can be a brilliant addition to any family, but they come with important and long-term responsibilities. As always, please remember that a dog is for le, not just for Christmas.\"Also,you are thinking about getting a dog this year, please consider rehoming a rescue dog from one of our brilliant animal sanctuaries, like Assisi Animal Sanctuary.\"Earlier this year figures from the Department of Agriculture showed thousands of dogs were being reported as strays.From April to December last year,  unclaimed strays were destroyed, with a further  unwanted animals put down.A total of , complaints were made about strays in this period, but less than a thirdwere reunited with their owners.More than , strays were taken on by new owners, with the rest either passed on to shelters , sold to the publicor euthanised .Of more than  dogs unwanted by their owners,  were passed to shelters,  were sold and  destroyed.Nigel Mason, chief executive of Assisi Animal Sanctuary, said: \"Please do consider looking at your local animal rescue sanctuaryyou are thinking of adding a new pet member of the family.\"People often dont understand the implications of a new pet, especiallyit is obtained from social media sources or, worse still, puppy farms.\"Sadly, Assisi sees too many dogs, cats, rabbits and guinea pigs obtained from these places, only to find that there are health and behavioural issues that were not disclosed.\"Many are then taken to sanctuaries like Assisi, as owners cannot or will not take on future responsibility for their animals.\"Once in our care we can help them to rehabilitate, but need the pet loving public to help us in offering homes for le.

I think it just sums up what the people of Lockerbie and those who’ve lost loved ones wanted to see here today.“We’re remembering and we’re also paying tribute on the night and in the following days of the disaster.”"},{"url":null,"title":"airport staff step in to babysit fish for passenger who cant take it on plane","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are lots of fun people. The food is delicious and there are tons of animals to play with – especially dogs!”In an interview with local TV station Denver, University of Colorado student Lanice said she was unhappy with how Southwest staff had handled the situation.She said they wouldn’t let her leave the fish on the counter for half an hour while they waited for a friend to come and pick him up, and wouldn’t even let her speak to a passenger on another airline – one that did allow fish – who had offered to take Cassie for her.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Denver International Airport – a lovely place for a minibreak “They were not allowing us to converse at all because they were thinking we were going to do some secret exchange throughout the airport,” Powless told Denver. “Even after I was no longer in possession of the fish, they still continued to have security around us and follow us through the airport and escorted onto our plane, aswe brought something bad onto the airport.”Southwest said that, although the Transportation Security Administration does allow live fish on planes, the airline’s own rules do not.A statement from Southwest read: “Last week, a customer attempted to bring a pet fish onboard their flight from Denver to San Diego. Our customer service agents informed the customer about Southwest’s pets policy which does not allow for live fish to travel in the passenger cabin. “Our team offered to re-book the customer for a later flight to allow them to make arrangements for their pet but the customer refused that option. The customer eventually travelled on their originally scheduled flight.”After his unscheduled stay at Denver International Airport, Cassie was collected by one of Lanice’s friends on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"powys independent conservative group give united front over budget proposals","story":"Powys County Council offices.\" \"   typemchtype\" \"\"Finance portfolio holder confident his budget will be backedCllr Aled Davies\" \"   typemchtype\" Skip to next image raquo"},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/9207502.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Clashes as Spanish cabinet holds meeting in CataloniaAccidentClimate change activists protest outside BBC sites across the countryAccident\"\"\"Moving Lockerbie service helps provide closure for family and friendsAccident\"\"\"Man in court on murder charge after father-of-three’s deathAccident\"\"\"Sunrise vigils and chilly sea dips mark winter solsticeAccident\"\"\"Labour MP sorry for backing musician accused of anti-SemitismAccident\"\"\"Meghan and Harry visit community kitchen which inspired Grenfell cookbookAccident\"\"\"Christmas getaway in full flow amid warnings of disruptionAccident\"\"\"Trump call with Turkish leader ‘led to US pullout from Syria’Accident\" class\"lazy\" style\"display: block min-height: rem\" data-iesrc\" .jpg htypetypenile-list\"\"\"\"‘Drone Dome’ system believed to be in use at Gatwick AirportAccident\"\"\"Zoo animals settle into new homes after fireAccident\"\"\"Man arrested after £m of ecstasy seized in raidAccident\"\"\"Harrods workers admit attack on homeless man in Trafalgar SquareAccident\"\"\"ScotRail accused of ‘forward planning failure’ as trains sent southAccident\"\"\"Lockerbie case couldto court  years after atrocityAccident\"\"\"Hi-tech radars target drones as Gatwick flights resumeAccident\"\"\"Father makes Santa’s Grotto appeal for three-year-old boy missing with motherAccident\"\"\"Giant ice-filled crater on Mars portrays idyllic wintry sceneAccident\"\"\"Mother of missing Liam Smith still hopeful he can be foundAccident\"\"\"Uncertain future for factory workers as firm delays Christmas wagesAccident\"\"\"Alba the albino orangutan s to jungle after rescueAccident\"\"\"UN experts urge UK to honour rights obligations over Julian AssangeAccident\"\"\"Banker jailed for le over escort murderAccident\"\"\"Man stabbed in west London streetAccident\"\"\"Aldi plans expansion with eight new stores in ScotlandAccident\"\"\"Image of bloody murder weapon published as teenage killer jailedAccident\"\"\"Wreaths laid on th anniversary of Lockerbie bombingAccident\"\"\" prisoners in Northern Ireland granted home leave for ChristmasAccident\"\"\" killed in mine explosion in Czech RepublicAccident\"\"\"Consultation launched on ‘good food nation’ plansAccident\"\"\"Rescued dog needed two kilograms of matted fur shaved offAccident\"\"\"First Minister urged to act on protecting beaversAccident\"\"\"Russian media watchdog launches probe into BBC World News channelAccident\"\"\"UK growth confirmed but business investment crashes as Brexit loomsAccident\"\"\"Family of kne crime victim release picture of bloody murder weaponAccident\"\"\"Brexit: the past seven daysAccident\"\"\"US ‘planning troop pullout from Afghanistan’Accident\"\"\"Police make  arrests in violent crime crackdownAccident\"\"\"Protective orders proposed to guard against domestic abuseAccident\"\"\"Two-year-old boy left infertile after surgeons operate on wrong testicleAccident\"\"\"Banker jailed for at least  years over murder of escortAccident\"\"\"Gatwick chief refuses to rule out further drone disruption in futureAccident\"\"\"Man seriously injured in shootingAccident\"\"\"Japan prosecutors file new allegation against Nissan’s GhosnAccident\"\"\"Military equipment used as Gatwick reopens after drone chaosAccident\"\"\"Christmas getaway to reach peak on FridayAccident\"\"\"Experts reveal the six ways climate change affected Christmas dinner this yearAccident\"\"\"Zizzi switches to British mozzarella amid Brexit and eco concernsAccidentGet involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

The number of recycling centres and their opening hours will also come under the microscope during next monthrsquos workshop.The event will explore the reviewrsquos recommendations and agree an implementation date, with the agreed way forward to be mapped out at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s farewell to Hugh  ","story":"SPA Golf Club brought a unique six-decade era to a close on Saturday when its longest playing member Hugh Hegan left for pastures new.Club captain in  and president two years ago Hugh has been a keen and regular competitor on the Spa fairways since his father mdash also called Hugh mdash introduced him to the sport in .Captivated by golf from the very beginning, Hugh played to a handicap of two at his peak and along the way established himself as one of the leading contenders at Spa.Over the years Hugh, who now has a highly respectable handicap of , has won many trophies including the Spa Cup mdash as a teenager in lsquo mdash Captainrsquos Day events and represented the club on Senior Cup, Junior Cup and Ulster Cup teams.As he said farewell to his many friends at Spa, before leaving for St Andrewrsquos in Scotland with his we Anne to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, Hugh reflected on the changes to the club which he will always call home.ldquoWhen I joined it was just a nine-hole course at the old Spa.ldquoThe facilities were basic to say the least.

The European Commission has set out plans for  areas most likely to be impactedthe UK leaves the bloc without a deal, but the Irish border was notably absent from the list.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his government has made no preparations whatsoever for a hard borderDublin has also published a -page ‘Getting Ireland Brexit Ready’ document outlining back up plans for almost  sectors.But again, crucially, the dossier made no mention of how the Republic plans to address the Irish border issue post-Brexit.The paper says the government’s main focus is to prevent the emergence of a hard border on the island of Ireland, though it does not specy how that will be preventedthe prime minister’s withdrawal agreement is rejected by Parliament.DUP Westminster leader Mr Dodds said the fact that the border issue had been omitted from the plans demonstrated that, in the event of a no-deal scenario, a hard border will not come to pass.His remarks came hours before Irish Premier Leo Varadkar said that his government has made “no preparations whatsoever” for a hard border on the island.Despite the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Varadkar said he felt thathis government made plans to facilitate a hard border it would become a “self-fulfilling prophecy”.He insisted that Dublin was not preparing for a hard border nor was it planning to introduce any sort of physical infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic.And he said the best way to avoid a hard Brexit is for Parliament to implement Theresa May’s draft withdrawal deal.The threat of a hard border is the main justication for the EU’s proposed backstop, which aims to keep NI in the EU customs union after Brexit, but which unionists fear will weaken the Union.Mr Dodds said the notion that it is necessary to have checks in the Irish Sea to avoid a hard border between NI and the Irish Republic is an “utter con trick”. The North Belfast MP added that the EU’s back up plans “totally avoid spelling out” what happens on the border, adding: “What does that tell you  Even in the event of a so-called no-deal scenario a hard border won’t happen.Gatwick drone chaos could have been avoided, says NI expertMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Even the Dublin authorities in its no-deal plans admitted no checks on goods at the border. “The utter hypocrisy of those espousing the current withdrawal agreement with its trap of a backstop has been completely exposed.”Asked by the News Letter this week, the EU did not explicitly say who might be responsible for building physical infrastructure at the border. But TUV leader Jim Allister has maintained that,the EU chooses to impose the hard border, Dublin would be obliged to implement it on the ground. DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said the EU and the Irish Republic’s warnings of a hard Brexit were “mere bluffs”, adding: “They will not be putting any checkpoints at the border. “A recent mapping exercise carried out by the Irish army has discovered almost  more crossings points into NI than was previously thought, making the idea of imposing a hard border totally and utter impossible.”Offering an explanation as to why the Irish border was not addressed in his government’s contingency plans, Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said the backstop is the only solution.“For us to be giving signals that there’s any other way this could be solved would be foolish,” he told RTE.Mr Coveney added that it would not be helpful for the document to be “dominated by that border debate”.Dublin’s contingency plans identied affected sectors that would require up to between  and  pieces of new legislation.The no-deal plans include the purchase of land at ports to prevent congestion from new customs.Speaking at a media briefing, Mr Varadkar said: “The contingency plans we are making are very real but they are happening at our ports, particularly Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare, where we have acquired or are in the process of acquiring land and will develop border control posts in those places.“They may be needed in March in the event of a hard Brexit, butthey are not needed in March, they will be, or are very likely to be, needed at some point into the future.“So that is the contingency planning that we are making, but we are not making to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. We simply cannot countenance that being the case.”try catch  TrendingThis is what N.I. prisoners will be eating on Christmas DayMan taken to hospital after incident in N.I. forestNorthern Ireland Christmas  payment dates for Universal Credit, tax credits, disability living allowance, PIP and moreSinn Fein mayor accused of lsquobad tastersquo over Irish Christmas cardN.I. family devastated after heartless thieves steal family pet          ..

Brian McClintonDickens also stressed that it should be a time of goodwill, charity, compassion and forgiveness, with the infant Jesus being replaced by a crippled child whose salvation depends on human rather than ine generosity. From a secular viewpoint, in Ebenezer Scrooge’s redemption, Dickens demonstrates man’s ability to redeem himself without appealing to an invisible deity.Yet it would be wrong to say that Dickens alone invented Christmas. It would be more accurate to say that he helped to revive what is essentially a mongrel festival that has added and subtracted erse elements over the centuries. The Bible gives no date for the birth of Jesus. The early Christians argued about when they should celebrate the momentous event. In about  CE, Pope Julius I decreed that the Feast of the Nativity should be celebrated on December  because it corresponded with other pagan midwinter festivals. Julius I therefore could claim to have invented ‘Christ’s Mass’.For the Romans it was for a long time the climax of the winter solstice festival of Saturnalia which lasted for a week after December . The th was the ‘dies natalis solis invicti’, the birthday of the unconquered sun god Saturn. In the Roman Saturnalia, roles were reversed, presents exchanged, and gambling, feasting, drinking, and singing naked in the street were part of the festivities.Not all Christians accepted December , but the sixth century theologian and mathematician Dionysius Exiguusoffered an explanation.In  CE he was asked by Pope John I to set out the dates for Easter from the years  to . Dionysius went further and invented the Christian Era calendar. He calculated that Jesus was born on December ,  years previously, though it was another  years before this Anno Domini date became dominant in Western Europe. Dionysius clearly has also claims as the inventor of Christmas.We now know that Dionysius was doubly wrong.The flight into Egypt, described in Matthew’s Gospel,it happened at all, must have occurred in  BCE at the very latest, because King Herod, from whom Joseph, Mary and their baby were fleeing, died in that year. So Jesus was definitely not born in the year  CE.The December  birth is also probably wrong. It it is unlikely that Jesus was born on that date the event described in Luke of the shepherds watching their flocks by night suggests a spring or summer date rather than one in the Palestine rainy season.Gatwick episode proves drone laws do not go far enough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The truth is that Christians hijacked a pagan festival and used its traditions to decorate the nativity myth. Holly and ivy are derived from the Romans, mistletoe came from the Druids, who believed it was a magical plant, and Yule logs were lit in ancient Scandinavia to honour Thor, the god of thunder. The Christmas tree is found in many cultures – the Romans themselves regarded the fir as sacred and decorated it with red berries. Nor was it Dickens who brought it to British shores. It was Queen Charlotte, the German we of George III, who set up the first known English tree at Windsor in December .Yet we should also stress that many Christians have themselves objected to these pagan intrusions. Even before it happened, the rd century theologian Origen denounced the whole idea of celebrating the birthday of Jesus “ashe were a King Pharaoh”.Much later, the th century Puritans in England and Massachusetts banned Christmas celebrations because they regarded the ‘debauchery’ as a dishonour to God. They also associated ‘Christ’s Mass’ with the Catholic Church which they regarded as ‘unChristian’. Some modern sects want to change the date of Christmas because it is unhistorical and because it would provide an opportunity to have a simpler, more exclusively Christian festival, stripped of all the drunkenness, gluttony, and materialism that characterises the modern event.As for us freethinkers and humanists, we’re probably in two minds about it all. Some of us think it is a stressful and costly period– yet another commercial contrivance in which there is a dreadful pressure to overspend. Others welcome an opportunity to celebrate being with family and friends and to enjoy a festival to cheer us up in the depths of winter and to celebrate the rebirth of the sun.Does Christmas really make us more aware of the earth’s appalling poverty and man’s inhumanity to man and other animals  Does it make our local politicians more charitable and forgiving to one another  Sadly, the world and Northern Ireland have still a long way to go to establish permanent peace and good will to all men. In this sense,asked what we think of Christmas, we might reply: “It would be a very good idea.”• Brian McClinton is a le-long humanist and a retired politics, economics, and history teacher at Friends’ School, Lisburn.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Parents in Moira, Maralin and other outlying areas would rightly be thinking whether a bus to Lurgan, then another bus to Portadown in the morning, then reverse the process in the afternoon - earlier starting and later finishing – would be conducive to their children’s well-being or learning.“The best way to meet their needs is that they remain on the Toberhewny site where teachers who know them, really know them, can offer them a first-class education.“Educators will tell you that transition at any age can bring regression for many children so why in Lurgan are we willing to let this happen “Previous Craigavon Senior High School principals often said it took at least a full term for pupils to settle down to learn. We are always teaching for readiness and when relationships are formed, the learning can begin.” They said staff at Lurgan Junior High School ‘would willingly embrace these young people and provide for them the best educational outcomes possible with a curriculum suited to their needs’.Their letter added: “The ideal solution would be for the pupils to remain on the Toberhewny site at a new - school, which would accommodate not only our - children but also those who would have gone on to Craigavon Senior High School .

Our pupils deserve to be treated equally.“Lurgan Junior High School is almost  years old so now is the time to be bullish and push for a modern, state of the art solution for all children in our catchment area.” In an appeal to parents they said: “Make every effort to attend the consultation meeting, Ask questions at the meeting, Speak up for your children – all are important whether Grammar or High School pupils.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
