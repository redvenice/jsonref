(Picture: AP)Theresa May said today she had authorised British forces to conduct precision air-launched cruise missile strikes on Syria to degrade its chemical weapons capability – adding that there ‘was no other choice’.Four Royal Air Force Tornado jets using Storm Shadow missiles had taken part in the attack on a military facility near Homs where it was assessed Syria had stockpiled chemicals, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.It came after intelligence indicated Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government was responsible for an attack using chemical weapons in Douma last Saturday.The Prime Minister said the missile strike was designed to minimise any civilian casualties and was not an attempt to change the Syrian government.In a statement, she said: ‘This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.’Smoke rises in Syria after US-led airstrikes targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus (Picture: SANA AP)Britain’s defence ministry said initial indications were that the precision weapons and meticulous target planning had ‘resulted in a successful attack’May said Britain and the West had an obligation to deter both Assad and others from using chemical weapons after the poison gas attack in Douma near Damascus killed up to 75 people including children.‘So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,’ she said.The Western missile strikes demonstrate the volatile nature of the Syrian civil war, which started in March 2011 as an anti-Assad uprising but is now a proxy conflict involving a number of world and regional powers and a myriad of insurgent groups.A picture released by the French Defence audiovisual communication and production unit (ECPAD) shows the launching of a cruise missile from a French military vessel in the Mediterranean sea towards targets in Syria overnight (Picture: AFP)US President Donald Trump said he was prepared to sustain the response until the government of Assad stopped its use of chemical weapons.Russia, which intervened in the war in 2015 to back Assad, has denied there was a chemical attack and has accused Britain of helping to stage the Douma incident to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.‘The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk,’ the MoD said in a statement.May said while the strike was targeted at Syria, it sent a message to anyone who used chemical weapons.Syrian soldiers hold their weapons as they dance and chant slogans against US President Trump during demonstrations following a wave of US, British and French military strikes to punish President Bashar Assad for suspected chemical attack against civilians (Picture: AP)Britain has accused Russia of being behind last month’s nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, southern England, a charge Moscow has rejected.‘This is the first time as prime minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat and it is not a decision I have taken lightly,’ she said.‘We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.’Many politicians in Britain, including some in May’s own Conservative Party, had called for parliament to be recalled from a break to give authority to any military strike.RAF Tornados taking-off on a sortie at RAF Akrotiri to conduct strikes in support of Operations over the Middle East (Picture: PA)Former Prime Minister David Cameron lost a parliamentary vote on air strikes against Assad’s forces in 2013 when 30 Conservative lawmakers voted against action, with many Britons wary of entering another conflict after intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region.May is not obliged to win parliament’s approval before ordering military action, but a non-binding constitutional convention to do so has been established since a 2003 vote on joining the US-led invasion of Iraq.Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had said Britain should press for an independent U.N.-led investigation into the suspected chemical attack in Douma rather than wait for instructions from Trump on how to proceed.Former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, now head of humanitarian relief group the International Rescue Committee, said military action needed to be part of a wider political strategy.‘Bombing cannot substitute for diplomacy,’ he said."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/09/17/4A5E4E4300000578-5595315-image-a-15_1523291174738.jpg","title":"Chloe Moretzs parents declared bankruptcy debts 5 487 891","story":"    Chloe Moretz\u0027s family lost everything when her parents declared bankruptcy in 2005, DailyMail.com can reveal.

By this point in the month the number is lower than hoped for.\u0027She added that the tussle between the warm air from the South and the wet weather in the West - which will bring rain to most places on Sunday - will finally be won by the continental influence on Monday.Ms Kent said temperatures in the south-east could hit 59F (15C) or 61F (16C) at the start of the working week.She said: \u0027By Tuesday across London we could see 18C (64F), maybe 19C (66F). By Wednesday, there\u0027s still going to be some patchy rain in parts of the north-west but England and Wales will have this continental air coming in.\u0027So, dry weather for them, plenty of sunshine again. Temperatures on Wednesday will again be highest in the South East. London could see between 20C and 23C.             \u0027And in fact, going further north, places like York could see 18C to 20c. And, even for Glasgow, it could be 17C or 18C on Wednesday.\u0027Ms Kent said: \u0027The trend into the end of the week is to continue this feed of warmer continental air across England and Wales. \u0027Those frontal systems are always trying to battle into the north-west, so it could be cloudier there with some more mixed weather at times.\u0027But, by the end of the week, in the that far south-eastern corner we could see temperatures into the low to mid-20s.\u0027Ms Kent said that these temperatures will be above the average for mid April.

They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/08/04D7E4AB000007D0-0-image-m-5_1523518559531.jpg","title":"Horrific moment female worker","story":"\u0027Guardian angel\u0027: Alexander Vysotsky is being hailed as a hero in Russia after he stepped in to save 28-year-old Ekaterina, right, from an \u0027attempted rape\u0027 The footage shows the victim bravely resisting, backing away towards the door and even grabbing the blade of the knife.He is seen forcing her  to the ground and pulling at her skirt. We\u0027ve got a dossier too!

Fortunately the guides had drilled it into our heads that if anything happens, don\u0027t run, don\u0027t run!\u0027After about an hour-and-a-half we came out of forest and looked up and about 100 metres away saw an elephant at the top of a little hill. \u0027We stopped immediately admired it and then suddenly it charged us.\u0027Mr Larsen continued: \u0027Dean our lead guide said, \u0027Don\u0027t move!\u0027, so we stood there frozen in terror as the elephant charged down the hill at us.\u0027 I\u0027m a pretty calm person. I don\u0027t yell and scream in a car crash. But I was scared to death.\u0027Straight away Dean had moved forward and become the target. He put his arm up and yelled \u0027Whoooa!\u0027 and about 10 metres away the elephant stopped dead in its tracks. \u0027It was unbelievable. It looked like something out of a cartoon. His front feet dug into the ground in a cloud of dust. I could not believe what I was seeing.\u0027With his right arm raised Dean was loudly commanding the elephant and it backed off. It was surreal.

You could see it was angry and meant business.\u0027After the third time the elephant moved off and all I could think of then was get us out of here.\u0027I watched it, relieved, and thought I looked like a child stomping off because Dean hadn\u0027t let it get its own way. \u0027It was flapping its ears and throwing sand over its back.

Bristol Crown Court (pictured) heard Ah\u0027Kiell had suffered brain injuries potentially caused by shaking, and may have been immersed in waterA post-mortem examination found Ah\u0027Kiell\u0027s death was caused by a lack of oxygen to his brain, with a pathologist also finding four older fractures to his ribs and a fracture to his shoulder.Jurors have been told that Walker was \u0027obsessed\u0027 with Ah\u0027Kiell\u0027s constipation and fed him water through bottles with the teat cut to increase the flow.Accounts given by Walker and Henry in police interviews do not explain his injuries, prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC said.Following the death, officers examined phones used by Henry and Walker.They revealed that Henry had told friends she wanted to end her relationship with Walker by the time Ah\u0027Kiell was nine or 10 weeks old.During the same period, internet searches were made on Walker\u0027s phone including \u0027shaken baby syndrome\u0027, \u0027can I squeeze my baby\u0027, \u0027internal bleeding due to trauma\u0027 and \u0027baby broken ribs\u0027.One search, on June 14, asked: \u0027Can babies feel pain?\u0027, followed by \u0027baby burst liver\u0027.Henry, of Tuffley, Gloucestershire, and Walker, of Lansdowne Green, London, deny all the charges against them."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/18/4B123D1100000578-5613355-There_are_many_theories_regarding_the_provenance_of_the_term_420-a-23_1523639963813.jpg","title":"What 420 weed day","story":"    420 is an unofficial celebration of cannabis when people rally and call for its legalisationOrigins of 420Many people erroneously believe that the term 420 is a reference to several things including: the police code for the drug in the US the number in the California penal code that is about the distribution of marijuana the deaths and anniversaries of various celebrities including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Bob Marley the number of chemical compounds in cannabis.They are not: 420 is not even a code in the NYPD or the LAPD. San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

Occasionally, she’ll be a-ish if she’s asked to do anything she doesn’t want to. On one shoot, she had to wear a silly Christmas hat and I could tell she wasn’t best pleased.She does this thing where it sounds like she’s muttering under her breath. When she had the hat on, she turned to one of the young boys sitting next to her and ‘muttered’. It was hilarious.And sometimes she likes to keep people waiting to get that great shot.

Roo, a five-year-old Dalmation, lives with Stephen Smythe, 65, a retired company director, and his wife, Carola, 63, in Central LondonIt wasn’t the first time that someone had told us we had a good-looking dog. It was my daughter who suggested I sign her up to a modelling agency. She’s done a variety of campaigns for brands such as Cath Kidston, Sainbury’s and McDonald’s. Photographers tell us that her contrasting markings make her very attractive: she’s not too black and not too white.The Cath Kidston shoot was particularly crazy because it involved more than 30 dogs recreating a scene from 101 Dalmations to promote a range of black and white clothes. Funnily enough, Roo’s grandmother actually starred as one of the 101 dogs in the 1996 version of the film.Roo took it all in her stride and we even bumped into her brother, which was a rather sweet moment.We don’t treat her as any kind of superstar: she’s simply our family pet who we treat occasionally to the odd grooming session at the vet. She’s well-behaved on shoots, apart from the time she had a little accident on the floor of a studio.It was my fault as I’d been rushing around all morning and had forgotten to let her do her business.Another time, she vomited after eating a huge bowl of food that was being photographed alongside her.

He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, Berkshire. Bronia says:It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star. I was appearing in panto with him and it was around the time that Pudsey the dog had won Britain’s Got Talent. Shane thought it would be funny to ‘do a Pudsey’ and get Archie to perform ‘tricks’ with him. Shane would then swap him for a toy dog and pretend that Archie was flying across the stage. The children in the audience couldn’t believe their eyes, but the adults were in fits of laughter.          Archie is an eight-year-old West Highland terrier. He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, BerkshireAfterwards, I sent Archie’s details off to the PetLondon modelling agency. He did a huge campaign for the pet charity PDSA last Christmas and his face was plastered all over the Tube and railway stations, and he was on television, too.We get around six jobs a year and every time we are booked for a shoot I ask if the client wants his fur long or short. Some people like them to look a bit fluffier.We give him a bath before each shoot, which he enjoys, and use a lovely coconut shampoo on him so his fur comes out ice-white.Once, when we did a shoot for Boden, we had to travel to London in the pouring rain and arrived with Archie looking like a drowned rat. The styling team thought it was hilarious that he sat there, quite happily, while I used a hairdryer on him and he fluffed up in no time.Terriers are often quite excitable but Archie’s a professional and he’ll often fall asleep while waiting to be called. I keep bits of chicken with me to encourage him to behave.If I use the word ‘Walk’, he will tilt his head in a very cute way. Sometimes he’s booked for jobs simply for that tilt of the head.  \u0027It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star.

He lives with owner Nicola Kazan, 33, a dog groomer, her husband Tufik, 33, a tailor, and son Theo, five, in Eton, Berkshire. Nicola says:Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’. There are not many red poodles in the UK, particularly in this apricot shade, so it’s no wonder he feels special.He’s a stud dog from the Czech Republic and originally belonged to my friend. One of her other poodles didn’t get on with Edward, so I asked if I could have him. He’s loving, intelligent and likes to be the centre of attention.Someone at ITV needed a red poodle for a show and got in touch after seeing Edward’s picture on Instagram. I then contacted the Urban Paws agency.          Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’Edward loved modelling from the very start. He’s appeared in various fashion campaigns, but the most high-profile is Stella McCartney.It was the Chinese Year of the Dog and her team wanted beautiful dogs to model her clothes. I’d never dressed Edward up in any outfits, but I said we’d give it a go.Edward couldn’t get enough of the fuss and attention. At one stage, he had two stylists preening and primping him and was wearing a gold dress that was easily worth more than £1,000.Then something caught his eye and he started racing around the studio. My heart stopped. I thought he’d ruin the dress — but he soon calmed down and we got some gorgeous shots.Once a week, I will shampoo and condition him, then dry him and make sure there are no knots. It takes around 45 minutes each time and he loves being brushed. He stands still like a statue.The money he earns varies, but usually it’s around £400 a day. I’m not allowed to say how much we were paid for the Stella job but I used £200 of it to treat Edward to a teeth-cleaning session at the vet.  Edward is a four-year-old miniature ‘red’ poodle.

Tom Ford has pet wire fox terriers, so we think that’s the reason Humphrey was chosen.The shoot wasn’t without its stresses for me. Humphrey is just a regular dog — he doesn’t do any tricks — and I had no idea how he’d behave. But he has such a lovely temperament and immediately bonded with everyone on set.His ‘instructions’ were to follow the male model around his flat as he got dressed for a night out, but at one stage Humphrey had to sit still. To keep him in one place, I had to hide behind the sofa, holding my hand out and saying: ‘Stay, Humphrey, stay.’ Thankfully, he did.At one point, he had to follow the model to the door when the doorbell rang. I didn’t think he’d do it, but he did — and got a round of applause from the team.Dogs are supposed to know their place, but now that he’s a high-end fashion model, I think Humphrey may get ideas above his station.Archie, Roo and Iraida provided by PetLondon – www.petlondonmodels.com   \u0027Ever since Humphrey was a puppy we’ve been stopped in the street by strangers asking if they can take his photograph.

Housing minister Dominic Raab faced criticism after he claimed net immigration had added 20 per cent to house prices in 25 yearsThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government used a model developed by the University of Reading, which found the increase in the number of immigrants living in England between 1991 and 2016 had added an extra £11,000 to average prices, in real terms.But leading economist Jonathan Portes criticised the model, saying it was ‘worse than the back of an envelope’.Mr Raab last week passed his concerns on to the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which is to publish a report to help the Government formulate new immigration plans. He said last night: ‘I welcome this transparency.

This means that immigration accounts for 21 per cent of the population-related increase on house prices.Rises in average incomes were responsible for a 150 per cent increase in house prices.The Ministry of Housing was forced to publish the figures to back up its claim that immigration had driven up house prices after the UK statistics watchdog demanded to see its modelling.

At the same time you can’t just airbrush the costs and the impact it has on housing.’But Mr Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College London, said the model was not reliable. He added: ‘This is worse than amateurback of envelope – I’m genuinely shocked the ministry would publish this.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/00/44F5977900000578-0-image-m-20_1523662699341.jpg","title":"NINE Cabinet ministers making 10 000 year renting properties","story":"    Jeremy Hunt was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interestsNine cabinet ministers including Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are making a fortune renting out properties, it was revealed. The Secretary of State for Housing, Sajid Javid, is also among the group of politicians raking in more than £10,000 from flats and houses they own. It comes after Mr Hunt failed to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he later rented out.  He was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interests. A spokesman for No 10 said: \u0027Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the Ministerial Code.

In a statement, the PM said the decision was one she had not taken lightly and was done in the national interest. Four RAF Tornados took off from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in the early hours and struck regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weaponsThe attack was focused on regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weapons. Declaring his support, French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the United States and Britain have launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal.\u0027Macron said in a statement on Saturday that France\u0027s \u0027red line has been crossed\u0027 after a suspected chemical attack last week in the Syrian town of Douma.He says there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 that the Syrian government is responsible.          Smoke could be seen rising after the overnight airstrikes that targeted military facilities in the Syrian capital, Damascus          The British missions against targets in Syria were launched the RAF Akrotiri base near Limassol on Cyprus in the early hoursMacron added the operation is limited to Syria\u0027s abilities to produce chemical weapons, and would not give details about what equipment is involved in the operation or what sites it is targeting.   Despite the ferocity of the Allied strikes, Syrian air defences claim to have shot down 13 missiles fired in the attack, Syrian state TV said. The missiles had been shot down in the Kiswah area south of Damascus.Shortly after the strike, the MOD released a statement, stating: \u0027The UK element of the carefully coordinated joint action was contributed by four Royal Air Force Tornado GR4s. \u0027They launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility – a former missile base – some fifteen miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapon precursors stockpiled in breach of Syria\u0027s obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. \u0027Very careful scientific analysis was applied to determine where best to target the Storm Shadows to maximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area. The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk.          French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the US and Britain had launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal\u0027\u0027Detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the strike is currently underway, but initial indications are that the precision of the Storm Shadow weapons and meticulous target planning have resulted in a successful attack.\u0027Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: \u0027The reason we have taken this action is because we all saw the images last week of the suffering that had been inflicted on innocent men, women and children, and there has been a need to act.\u0027That\u0027s why last night we deployed four Tornados armed with Storm Shadow cruise missiles. \u0027You will be pleased to hear all of those crews have returned safely and every early indication is that is has been a highly successful mission.\u0027This is something we have been in discussion with the US and French over the last few days but obviously the meeting of Cabinet is where this was properly discussed.\u0027Mr Williamson said the service personnel involved in last night\u0027s attack have played \u0027an important role in terms of degrading the Syrian regime in using chemical weapons in the future\u0027. \u0027The reprehensible use of chemical weapons in Douma is further evidence of the Syrian regime\u0027s appalling cruelty against its own people.\u0027We will not stand by whilst innocent civilians, including women and children, are killed and made to suffer.\u0027The international community has responded decisively with legal and proportionate military force. Let these united actions send a clear message to the regime – the use of chemical weapons is categorically unacceptable and you will be held to account.\u0027    US Defense Secretary James Mattis says the US and its allies have taken \u0027decisive action\u0027 against Syrian chemical weapons infrastructure.Mattis briefed reporters at the Pentagon Friday an hour after President Donald Trump announced the strike.Mattis said the United States, along with France and the United Kingdom, struck because Syrian President Bashar Assad \u0027did not get the message\u0027 when the U.S. launched airstrikes after a chemical attack in 2017.The defense secretary said Friday\u0027s strikes have \u0027sent a clear message\u0027 to Assad and his \u0027murderous lieutenants.\u0027Mattis said the strikes are \u0027directed at the Syrian regime\u0027 and they have \u0027gone to great lengths to avoid civilians and foreign casualties.\u0027Mattis said the U.S. has no reports of suffering any losses during the initial airstrikes on Syria Friday. Mattis said \u0027right now this is a one-time shot\u0027 but is not ruling out further attacks. President Donald Trump had said earlier that the campaign against the regime of Bashar Assad could be \u0027sustained.\u0027The defense secretary says the airstrikes were launched against several sites that he says helped provide Assad\u0027s ability to create chemical weapons.Mattis said he is \u0027absolutely confident\u0027 that Syrian President Bashar Assad is behind the alleged chemical attack on his people that the U.S. and allies retaliated against Friday night.He says the U.S. is \u0027very much aware of one of the chemical agents used.\u0027 And he says there may have been a second.        Yesterday details emerged of a Cabinet meeting the PM held on Thursday where she won the backing of her ministers to proceed without a parliamentary vote.She told Cabinet: \u0027Since 1918 we have worked to uphold the international norm that chemical weapons are abhorrent and must never be used. In recent years that international norm has been eroded and that should be a matter of deep concern to us all. The use of chemical weapons should not go unchallenged.\u0027The Prime Minister said Britain had to act in order to restore that norm, because the weapons inflict human misery. Downing Street sources said she made the point that these weapons had been used a number of times in Syria – and also in Salisbury.          \u0027These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead,\u0027 Mr Trump said referring to Assad (pictured)The need to restore international norms was shared by the whole Cabinet, Downing Street sources said. They said: \u0027Cabinet have been impressed that from the off she has been very robust and very clear. She was the most hawkish.\u0027Russia\u0027s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, held a press conference at his residence accusing Britain of peddling myths about Russia\u0027s activities.At one point he compared allegations that the Syrian government had gassed its own people to Tony Blair\u0027s claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.He also suggested the alleged use of chemical weapons was a hoax and may have been used to discredit Assad. The Russian embassy in the UK said: \u0027Military strikes may be used to cover up all the evidence, or lack thereof, on the ground.\u0027Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the military had \u0027proof that testifies to the direct participation of Britain in the organising of this provocation in eastern Ghouta\u0027.          Theresa May\u0027s statement in full \u0027This evening I have authorised British armed forces to conduct co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime\u0027s chemical weapons capability and deter their use.\u0027We are acting together with our American and French allies.\u0027In Douma, last Saturday a chemical weapons attack killed up to 75 people, including young children, in circumstances of pure horror.\u0027The fact of this attack should surprise no-one.\u0027The Syrian Regime has a history of using chemical weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.\u0027And a significant body of information including intelligence indicates the Syrian Regime is responsible for this latest attack.\u0027This persistent pattern of behaviour must be stopped – not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons.\u0027We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this.\u0027But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted. Even this week the Russians vetoed a Resolution at the UN Security Council which would have established an independent investigation into the Douma attack.\u0027So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Regime.\u0027This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.\u0027It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties.\u0027And while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian Regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.\u0027At this time, my thoughts are with our brave British servicemen and women – and our French and American partners – who are carrying out their duty with the greatest professionalism.\u0027The speed with which we are acting is essential in co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u0027This is the first time as Prime Minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat – and it is not a decision I have taken lightly.\u0027I have done so because I judge this action to be in Britain\u0027s national interest.\u0027We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.\u0027We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u0027History teaches us that the international community must defend the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.\u0027That is what our country has always done. And what we will continue to do. \u0027                                                          President Trump\u0027s Friday night address My fellow Americans: a short time ago I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both. Tonight I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian air force.Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians, this time in the town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by the very terrible regime. the evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster, instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power -- military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran and to Russia I ask, what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants and murderous dictators. In 2013 President Putin and his government promised the world they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u0027s chemical weapons. Assad\u0027s recent attack and today\u0027s response are the direct result of Russia\u0027s failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully some day we\u0027ll get along with Russia and maybe even Uran, but maybe not. I will say this, the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria the United States with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS.America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria. Under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home and great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u0027s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of World War I, more than 1 million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return. So today, the nations of Britain, France and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria.

Now Rovelli is back to explore the mysteries of time. He tells  Charlotte Higgins about student revolution and how his quantum leap began with an acid trip• Extract from Carlo Rovelli’s new book: on the elastic concept of time What do we know about time? Language tells us that it “passes”, it moves like a great river, inexorably dragging us with it, and, in the end, washes us up on its shore while it continues, unstoppable. Time flows. It moves ever forwards. Or does it? Poets also tell us that time stumbles or creeps or slows or even, at times, seems to stop. They tell us that the past might be inescapable, immanent in objects or people or landscapes. When Juliet is waiting for Romeo, time passes sluggishly: she longs for Phaethon to take the reins of the Sun’s chariot, since he would whip up the horses and “bring in cloudy night immediately”. When we wake from a vivid dream we are dimly aware that the sense of time we have just experienced is illusory.Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist who wants to make the uninitiated grasp the excitement of his field. His book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, with its concise, sparkling essays on subjects such as black holes and quanta, has sold 1.3m copies worldwide. Now comes The Order of Time, a dizzying, poetic work in which I found myself abandoning everything I thought I knew about time – certainly the idea that it “flows”, and even that it exists at all, in any profound sense.We meet outside the church of San Petronio in Bologna, where Rovelli studied. (“I like to say that, just like Copernicus, I was an undergraduate at Bologna and a graduate at Padua,” he jokes.) A cheery, compact fellow in his early 60s, Rovelli is in nostalgic mood. He lives in Marseille, where, since 2010, he has run the quantum gravity group at the Centre de physique théorique. Before that, he was in the US, at the University of Pittsburgh, for a decade.He rarely visits Bologna, and he has been catching up with old friends. We wander towards the university area. Piazza Verdi is flocked with a lively crowd of students. There are flags and graffiti and banners, too – anti-fascist slogans, something in support of the Kurds, a sign enjoining passers-by not to forget Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge PhD student killed in Egypt in 2016.“In my day it was barricades and police,” he says. He was a passionate student activist, back then. What did he and his pals want? “Small things! We wanted a world without boundaries, without state, without war, without religion, without family, without school, without private property.”He was, he says now, too radical, and it was hard, trying to share possessions, trying to live without jealousy. And then there was the LSD. He took it a few times. And it turned out to be the seed of his interest in physics generally, and in the question of time specifically. “It was an extraordinarily strong experience that touched me also intellectually,” he remembers. “Among the strange phenomena was the sense of time stopping. Things were happening in my mind but the clock was not going ahead the flow of time was not passing any more. It was a total subversion of the structure of reality. He had hallucinations of misshapen objects, of bright and dazzling colours – but also recalls thinking during the experience, actually asking himself what was going on.“And I thought: ‘Well, it’s a chemical that is changing things in my brain. But how do I know that the usual perception is right, and this is wrong? If these two ways of perceiving are so different, what does it mean that one is the correct one?’” The way he talks about LSD is, in fact, quite similar to his description of reading Einstein as a student, on a sun-baked Calabrian beach, and looking up from his book imagining the world not as it appeared to him every day, but as the wild and undulating spacetime that the great physicist described. Reality, to quote the title of one of his books, is not what it seems.He gave his conservative, Veronese parents a bit of a fright, he says. His father, now in his 90s, was surprised when young Carlo’s lecturers said he was actually doing all right, despite the long hair and radical politics and the occasional brush with the police. It was after the optimistic sense of student revolution in Italy came to an abrupt end with the kidnapping and murder of the former prime minister, Aldo Moro, in 1978 that Rovelli began to take physics seriously. But his route to his big academic career was circuitous and unconventional. “Nowadays everyone is worried because there is no work. When I was young, the problem was how to avoid work. I did not want to become part of the ‘productive system’,” he says.Academia, then, seemed like a way of avoiding the world of a conventional job, and for some years he followed his curiosity without a sense of careerist ambition. He went to Trento in northern Italy to join a research group he was interested in, sleeping in his car for a few months (“I’d get a shower in the department to be decent”). He went to London, because he was interested in the work of Chris Isham, and then to the US, to be near physicists such as Abhay Ashtekar and Lee Smolin. “My first paper was horrendously late compared to what a young person would have to do now. And this was a privilege – I knew more things, there was more time.”The popular books, too, have come relatively late, after his academic study of quantum gravity, published in 2004. If Seven Brief Lessons was a lucid primer, The Order of Time takes things further it deals with “what I really do in science, what I really think in depth, what is important for me”.Rovelli’s work as a physicist, in crude terms, occupies the large space left by Einstein on the one hand, and the development of quantum theory on the other. If the theory of general relativity describes a world of curved spacetime where everything is continuous, quantum theory describes a world in which discrete quantities of energy interact. In Rovelli’s words, “quantum mechanics cannot deal with the curvature of spacetime, and general relativity cannot account for quanta”.Both theories are successful but their apparent incompatibility is an open problem, and one of the current tasks of theoretical physics is to attempt to construct a conceptual framework in which they both work. Rovelli’s field of loop theory, or loop quantum gravity, offers a possible answer to the problem, in which spacetime itself is understood to be granular, a fine structure woven from loops.String theory offers another, different route towards solving the problem. When I ask him what he thinks about the possibility that his loop quantum gravity work may be wrong, he gently explains that being wrong isn’t the point being part of the conversation is the point. And anyway, “If you ask who had the longest and most striking list of results it’s Einstein without any doubt. But if you ask who is the scientist who made most mistakes, it’s still Einstein.”How does time fit in to his work? Time, Einstein long ago showed, is relative – time passes more slowly for an object moving faster than another object, for example. In this relative world, an absolute “now” is more or less meaningless. Time, then, is not some separate quality that impassively flows around us. Time is, in Rovelli’s words, “part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space”.For Rovelli, there is more: according to his theorising, time itself disappears at the most fundamental level. His theories ask us to accept the notion that time is merely a function of our “blurred” human perception. We see the world only through a glass, darkly we are watching Plato’s shadow-play in the cave. According to Rovelli, our undeniable experience of time is inextricably linked to the way heat behaves. In The Order of Time, he asks why can we know only the past, and not the future? The key, he suggests, is the one-directional flow of heat from warmer objects to colder ones. An ice cube dropped into a hot cup of coffee cools the coffee. But the process is not reversible: it is a one-way street, as demonstrated by the second law of thermodynamics.Time is also, as we experience it, a one-way street. He explains it in relation to the concept of entropy – the measure of the disordering of things. Entropy was lower in the past. Entropy is higher in the future – there is more disorder, there are more possibilities. The pack of cards of the future is shuffled and uncertain, unlike the ordered and neatly arranged pack of cards of the past. But entropy, heat, past and future are qualities that belong not to the fundamental grammar of the world but to our superficial observation of it. “If I observe the microscopic state of things,” writes Rovelli, “then the difference between past and future vanishes … in the elementary grammar of things, there is no distinction between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’.”To understand this properly, I can suggest only that you read Rovelli’s books, and pass swiftly over this approximation by someone who gave up school physics lessons joyfully at the first possible opportunity. However, it turns out that I am precisely Rovelli’s perfect reader, or one of them, and he looks quite delighted when I check my newly acquired understanding of the concept of entropy with him. (“You passed the exam,” he says.)“I try to write at several levels,” he explains. “I think about the person who not only doesn’t know anything about physics but is also not interested. So I think I am talking to my grandmother, who was a housekeeper. I also think some young students of physics are reading it, and I also think some of my colleagues are reading it. So I try to talk at different levels, but I keep the person who knows nothing in my mind.”His biggest fans are the blank slates, like me, and his colleagues at universities – he gets most criticism from people in the middle, “those who know a bit of physics”. He is also pretty down on school physics. (“Calculating the speed at which a ball drops – who cares? In another life, I’d like to write a school physics book,” he says.) And he thinks the ision of the world into the “two cultures” of natural sciences and human sciences is “stupid. It’s like taking England and iding the kids into groups, and you tell one group about music, and one group about literature, and the one who gets music is not allowed to read novels and the one who does literature is not allowed to listen to music.”The joy of his writing is its broad cultural compass. Historicism gives an initial hand-hold on the material. (He teaches a course on history of science, where he likes to bring science and humanities students together.) And then there’s the fact that alongside Einstein, Ludwig Boltzmann and Roger Penrose appear figures such as Proust, Dante, Beethoven, and, especially, Horace – each chapter begins with an epigraph from the Roman poet – as if to ground us in human sentiment and emotion before departing for the vertiginous world of black holes and spinfoam and clouds of probabilities.“He has a side that is intimate, lyrical and extremely intense and he is the great singer of the passing of time,” Rovelli says. “There’s a feeling of nostalgia – it’s not anguish, it’s not sorrow – it’s a feeling of ‘Let’s live life intensely’. A good friend of mine, Ernesto, who died quite young, gave me a little book of Horace, and I have carried it around with me all my life.”Rovelli’s view is that there is no contradiction between a vision of the universe that makes human life seem small and irrelevant, and our everyday sorrows and joys. Or indeed between “cold science” and our inner, spiritual lives. “We are part of nature, and so joy and sorrow are aspects of nature itself – nature is much richer than just sets of atoms,” he tells me. There’s a moment in Seven Lessons when he compares physics and poetry: both try to describe the unseen. It might be added that physics, when departing from its native language of mathematical equations, relies strongly on metaphor and analogy. Rovelli has a gift for memorable comparisons. He tells us, for example, when explaining that the smooth “flow” of time is an illusion, that “The events of the world do not form an orderly queue like the English, they crowd around chaotically like the Italians.” The concept of time, he says, “has lost layers one after another, piece by piece”. We are left with “an empty windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality … a world stripped to its essence, glittering with an arid and troubling beauty”.More than anything else I’ve ever read, Rovelli reminds me of Lucretius, the first-century BCE Roman author of the epic-length poem, On the Nature of Things. Perhaps not so odd, since Rovelli is a fan. Lucretius correctly hypothesised the existence of atoms, a theory that would remain unproven until Einstein demonstrated it in 1905, and even as late as the 1890s was being written off as absurd. What Rovelli shares with Lucretius is not only a brilliance of language, but also a sense of humankind’s place in nature – at once a part of the fabric of the universe, and in a particular position to marvel at its great beauty. It’s a rationalist view: one that holds that by better understanding the universe, by discarding false beliefs and superstition, one might be able to enjoy a kind of serenity. Though Rovelli the man also acknowledges that the stuff of humanity is love, and fear, and desire, and passion: all made meaningful by our brief lives our tiny  of allotted time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfe474551f5de9d3f152a8bc0565a5f08a0ccb51/0_264_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c1be7e199be80eab919096bbaa98529 1240w","title":"lionel shriver property metoo cultural appropriation","story":"Lionel Shriver is a US writer and journalist whose novels include So Much For That, The Post-Birthday World, The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047 and the bestselling We Need to Talk About Kevin, which won the 2005 Orange prize and was turned into a film by Lynne Ramsay, starring Tilda Swinton. In 2014, she won the BBC national short story award. She lives in London and Brooklyn. Her latest book is Property, a themed collection of stories and two novellas.Were the stories in your new book written by design to be read alongside one another or did they just accrue over time?I’d written the novella, The Subletter, and wanted to give it a home. So you could say they were accrued by design: every time I got a commission, I made sure the story had something to do with property. I’m interested in the way in which what we own becomes a projection of the self – and in territory, too, literally and metaphorically. I’m very territorial, particularly about my study. If my husband wants to park his drums in there, I’ll tolerate it in the short term, but I would never allow it in the long term.How do you feel about the seemingly endless debate regarding short stories and whether or not they are enjoying a revival?It’s utterly boring. I’m sick of it, and I think readers are, too. This whole conversation about form is tedious and we should stop having it. There is some appetite for the short story, but like lots of people I would rather read a novel that’s another reason why I themed Property, so it’s more of a unified\u0026nbspexperience.Do you think immigration is one of the subjects of our time?It’s the subject of the century, and it needs to be talked about with robustness and immediacy, and it is underexplored in literature. For obvious structural reasons, fiction is almost exclusively concerned with the experience of the immigrant and has no time for the native-born person whose world is being transformed. The immigrant is the risk-taker, the adventurer and the party who is at a disadvantage, whereas the native-born person is selfish and looks bigoted and mean. How do you write about that? I’ve just had a little rant, but I’ve never followed my own advice. I don’t know if I ever would write it. It’s too\u0026nbspdangerous.What about #MeToo? Is it already having an effect both on fiction, and the way we read it?I’m not inclined to join bandwagons. I don’t like crowds I always want to step back. I am dismayed by critics and readers who approach literature in the spirit of Sunday school. We’re judging authors: he put his hand on the wrong knee. From there, you’re only a hop, skip and a jump away from not being able to have your characters put their hands on the wrong knees. I don’t read novels with a prissy little pen in my hand, looking for sinning characters who don’t live up to certain political expectations. What a boring way of reading books.What books might people be surprised to see on your shelves?Cookbooks: a fair whack of them. But aside from heading to Betty Crocker for “canary corn sticks”, I hardly ever consult them. I prefer my messy files of clippings, scrawled with my own notes (“multiply chilli flakes by four”). By comparison, recipes in books always feel a little dead.Which writer do you always return to, and why?Richard Yates. One of the few writers who rewards rereading. He is both cruel and forgiving with his characters. I regard him as something between a role model and a kindred spirit.What was the last great novel you\u0026nbspread?Amy Bloom’s White Houses. She really brings Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt to life as regular people, not icons.What kind of reader were you as a\u0026nbspchild?Voracious and indiscriminate. Prone to obsessive phases.

And the fact that the timing seems to have been dictated at least in part by a prime minister running scared of a parliamentary vote is little short of scandalous.By refusing to engage parliament on the issue, Theresa May has shown a contempt for parliamentary democracy, and trampled over an important safeguard against unwanted military action.As a result, we’ve found ourselves rushing headfirst into striking a foreign nation alongside a trigger-happy US president when there is little evidence to suggest that our actions will make a positive difference, and much to suggest that they could make matters worse. To intervene militarily before Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors have even been able to investigate the site is also deeply concerning.The risks of escalation are real. Only on Friday the UN secretary general said “the cold war is back with a vengeance”. Russia has already threatened to attack the “source” of any missiles aimed at Syria – and I fear mission creep leading to any attempted “regime change” imposed by the west.Look at Libya, at the rise of Isis in Iraq, at the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan – the long-term impacts of our recent military interventions are a bloody stain on our country’s record. Syria is a tinderbox, the theatre for proxy wars by numerous different actors, and is already deepening the tensions between Israel and Iran. To drop bombs on Assad without a serious, thought-out strategy, and a plan about what happens next, risks making a horrific situation even worse. Even if early indications are that the regime, Russia and Iran will shrug this off in military terms, they will certainly milk it for propaganda and make the search for peace even harder. There is, of course, much that we can be doing. We should be cracking down on Russia through further sanctions and pursuing diplomatic channels. It’s worth noting that US sanctions against Russia are finally beginning to have an effect. New US sanctions on seven oligarchs, 17 top officials and 12 companies led to tens of billions of dollars in losses on Russian markets within just a few hours on Monday, and the rouble recently suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years. We now need to double down on these actions.And Britain urgently needs to get its own house in order if we want to be a positive influence on the world stage. That means ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, standing up to the aggression of the Israeli government and playing our part as a nation of peace building.The attacks may have already started, but some semblance of democracy must now be restored. Theresa May must bring a debate and, crucially, a vote to parliament on Monday – and give MPs an unwhipped say on these strikes.

Decoded, that means attacks carefully targeted not only to minimise civilian casualties – which so often discredit action of this kind as reporters are guided to the sites of strikes by the dictator being attacked – but more particularly to avoid provoking Vladimir Putin into a “disproportionate response” (the sanitised diplomatic language of these situations).Time and time again Putin has shown his contempt not only for international law (witness Crimea and Salisbury) and chemical weapons conventions (witness Syria and Salisbury), but also western power and pretensions – witness his dismemberment of Ukraine.The west clearly has to contend with a massive Putin problem and threat – as well as unspeakable war crimes in Syria, where Putin is propping up Assad – and a humanitarian catastrophe that engages the west morally and directly, because of the ongoing refugee crisis that Syria is inflicting on its neighbours and Europe.The case that could be made for May is that we in Britain have recently been attacked by the Russians and are threatened by Putin at large. Trump and Emmanuel Macron supported us in expelling Putin diplomats after Salisbury. They were intent on these limited airstrikes in Syria, to appease domestic pressures, so we had to support them. But having decided to do so, May couldn’t risk a parliamentary debate, partly because her arguments are weak, but also because, with a hung parliament and Labour under Jeremy Corbyn so unwilling to play conventional politics, the vote might have been lost.The August 2013 Commons vote, when MPs rejected David Cameron’s motion to support bombing Syria in similar circumstances, will have weighed heavily with May and Tory whips. There were no constitutional or security reasons for parliament to have been sidelined this time. On the contrary, there were compelling constitutional arguments why MPs should have been consulted. The cabinet met with full publicity on Thursday to authorise the action. Parliament could have been summoned for Friday, entirely consistent with undertaking the bombing in the evening, had there been a majority for action.Had May made the basic “back Trump against Putin” case, and no other, in the Commons, I suspect she would have rallied Tory MPs and the DUP to avoid a defeat, on the assurance that this action was one-off.It is a vital British and European interest to demonstrate to Putin that Trump is on our side, not his. Our security and defence services are rightly concerned that Putin may not understand this and might thereby seriously miscalculate, perhaps by invading the vulnerable Baltic states in a widening of his Ukrainian enterprise and quest for nationalistic glory.The problem for May is that she can hardly say any of this in parliament. She has to make humanitarian and strategic arguments about the need for the Trump action in order to help Syria itself and eradicate chemical weapons. But these arguments do not exist.The bloodshed and conflict in Syria are not largely caused caused by chemical weapons, however abhorrent. Other weapons are destroying hundreds of thousands of people, and their communities, with impunity. Trump, Macron and May have made clear that they intend neither to intervene in Syria more widely, nor to engage in direct conflict with the Russians over chemical weapons. So this is not a prelude to a western strategy to topple Assad and seek an end to the civil war or chemical weapons.Is there a moral case for the action, even if it did little or nothing to help Syria? Hardly. We have moral duties to the dispossessed – and should be taking our fair share of Syrian refugees, particularly parentless children. We aren’t. And May did not propose to do so in her press conference. That is the really shameful non-action of our government. • Andrew Adonis is a Labour peer, former transport secretary and former chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51bb3c7bbeeb9686e8c187845226de381ae5058c/447_442_6024_3614/master/6024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74d40fd8cea88f19e524a6c7687ec155 1240w","title":"british museum director hartwig fischer there are no foreigners here the museum is a world country","story":"The German art historian reveals plans for an extensive revamp at Britain’s most visited attraction, but won’t be drawn on calls to return plundered worksHartwig Fischer, who took over the directorship of the British Museum from Neil MacGregor two years ago, has no decoration on the plain blue walls of his office. There are glass-fronted bookshelves. There ia a desk and chairs and two enormous sash windows looking out on to the great forecourt. (Or, more immediately, on to what some staff call the “Bake Off tent” – the ugly temporary structure through which visitors must currently pass for security checks.) But there is nothing to signal Fischer’s taste – nothing like the glimmering wall sculpture by El Anatsui that MacGregor had nothing like the array of Staffordshire pottery that Tristram Hunt displays in his office at the V\u0026ampA no equivalent to the Paula Rego that Maria Balshaw favours in her lair at Tate. There is only a reproduction of a Cycladic figure on the fireplace, a leftover from the MacGregor years, and, on his desk lamp, a tiny figurine of Sai Baba, a spiritual master revered as a saint, which Indian friends gave him.Instead, he says, he prefers to concentrate on the people who come through his doors – and the great treasure house of the museum. But the blankness of his working space radiates through his personal manner: he is warm and friendly, but oddly remote. His employees contrast the charismatic immediacy of MacGregor, who had the disconcerting habit of plonking himself down by random staffers in the canteen and interrogating them about their work, with this more distant figure, who speaks softly and carefully, who glides modestly around the galleries, who is sphinx-like in his statements. But for all that, he is quietly formidable, and has vast ambitions for the museum – plans that will, if they see the light of day, transform the museum for generations to come.Fischer, 56, who came to London after running the state museums in Dresden, is aiming to put the museum, in all its shopworn grandeur, through a major renovation project that will culminate in a complete redisplay of its galleries. That doesn’t sound so remarkable until you begin to absorb the scale of the job. When I joke that it can’t be as big as the Palace of Westminster’s renovation, which will cost at least £3.5bn, he tells me that the museum has more rooms than parliament – 3,000 versus 1,100 – and that the state of the essential services, such as electricity, gas and water are in dire need of repair, just as they are at Westminster. He has in mind something as grand and decisive as the “projet grand” Louvre, which saw the building of IM Pei’s dramatic pyramids and cost between F6bn and F7bn (around £780m at 1993 prices). Or the recent renovation of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which saw the institution closed for a decade and a bill of €375m.Unlike Amsterdam, though, Fischer says: “We cannot close the museum. It’s entirely out of the question.” The British Museum is the most visited attraction in Britain, with 5.9m visitors last year. Work will have to be phased. It will take years. As for even a vague price tag, he is not to be drawn: assessments are still being carried out. And who will pay? Clearly, there will have to be the mother of all fundraising campaigns. But Fischer carefully notes that the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum were renewed “with the support of their governments”. What Fischer hopes to achieve by the end of all this is a display that is more coherent – and more interconnected. That means reshuffling the Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections so that they are not scattered between two floors as they are at present, and also finding ways to show that, as Fischer puts it, “human history was driven and has always been driven by exchange, by cultures communicating”. The interconnectedness he is keen to demonstrate might also be across time: towards the end of our interview we go over to the museum’s big exhibition space, where a stunning show on Rodin and ancient Greek sculpture is being installed. It’s the first exhibition to have been largely developed under his leadership, and its approach – looking at how an artist was shaped by his understanding of the past – might prove a hint at the shape of the programme to come.It’s an intriguing time to be considering the renewal of the British Museum – one of the world’s few so-called “encyclopedic museums” – as Fischer puts it, “a museum of the world for the world”. But Britain is on the brink of Brexit, turning its face away from Europe. When I ask Fischer if he would have taken the job had it been offered on 24 June 2016, he says: “Yes, without any hesitation whatsoever.” This contrasts to the view taken by the late Martin Roth, his predecessor at Dresden, whose resignation from the V\u0026ampA in September 2016 was said to have been hastened by disillusion at the referendum.The museum’s job, Fischer says, is to take the long view, to confront the whole of human history, to understand that Brexit is a moment in the turbulent story of the world. But at the same time: “Everyone who knows me knows I come from a European background and that Europe, as it developed after the catastrophe of the wars is something very important and precious to me. The museum has a lot to offer to help people to contemplate and reflect on what the right decisions should be without taking a direct political stance. It’s there as a space to think, reflect, debate.” It is true that Fischer could hardly be more European. He was raised in Hamburg, studied in Italy and France, and has worked in Switzerland as well as Germany his wife is a psychotherapist in Paris. It’s easy to imagine what his personal views might be, even if for now, they are cloaked in civil service neutrality. He simply says: “Whoever comes in here and crosses the threshold is not a foreigner. There are no foreigners here. This is a world country, this museum. While at the same time we recognise that this is a British creation, to which the cultures of all the world have contributed.”Contributed, yes – but not always willingly. The museum’s collection is inextricably entwined with Britain’s dark imperial past. Increasingly, nations want their objects back: not just the Greeks and the Parthenon sculptures, but others – there is a longstanding claim from Ethiopia, for example, about works of art plundered from Maqdala after its capture by the British in 1868.It’s all very well, I suggest, talking of the museum as an international project, and even as a space where international co-operation between colleagues can continue when formal diplomatic ties are strained. (Fischer made a visit to Iran in December when we meet, he has just returned from Egypt.) But the buck stops for many with the objects themselves, with the fact of possession and ownership. “When you go to see the Parthenon sculptures,” he says, “you can read about the different views, the conflicting views, and we respect different views.” Respecting views is one thing, but keeping the objects is another – that’s the line drawn right there, isn’t it? “It is a line. But what’s been created here is a major contribution to humanity. So while I respect these views, I always say what has been created here, which is open to everybody, creates an extraordinary opportunity to see cultural heritage in a context you have in only a very few places. That is the museum’s major value and it is very precious.”Fischer has come into this environment from the relatively easier circumstances of Germany, where government support for culture, though under recent pressure, is understood as a given, not fought over tooth and nail every step of the way. One of the things he is really passionate about is a music festival he has organised it will see everything from Ligeti and Nono to Japanese temple music performed in the museum’s galleries. “I’ve always worked with musicians in museums,” he says. “When you look at things listening, you look at things differently. The ears make you see more, and the eyes make you hear more.” Ironically, the festival, which is organised in partnership with the Dresden museums, is being paid for by the German foreign ministry. Still, what impresses him in London, he says, is his staff’s passionate sense of public mission. “You would never think about doing something in this place before asking who it is for. You would never get lost in an intricate scholarly debate without coming back to that question: ‘How is our public going to profit from this?’ And I cherish every day working in this environment.”The music festival Europe and the World: a Symphony of Cultures, runs from 16 to 29 April. Rodin and the art of Ancient Greece runs from 26 April to 29 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/355e464df0695bb50dc0339ea1ca5e52fe99a04d/114_156_2695_1617/master/2695.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b7a8141546b58275952068dcfd6fa53a 1240w","title":"burnley leicester premier league match report","story":"Burnley made it five successive top-flight wins for the first time in half a century as the prospect of European football at Turf Moor next season drew ever closer.It is more than 50 years since the Clarets have been involved in a continental competition but their 2-1 victory over their closest rivals, Leicester, gave them a nine-point advantage with only five games left. Provided Southampton do not win the FA Cup, seventh place would be enough for a spot in the Europa League.Sean Dyche’s side did the damage in the first 10 minutes, the former Foxes striker Chris Wood and the defender Kevin Long putting them two up. Jamie Vardy’s 72nd-minute strike made it a nervy finish but the hosts held on.Burnley had been reluctant to talk about the possibility of European football but after last weekend’s results, when they beat Watford and Leicester lost to Newcastle, the veneer slipped. The chairman, Mike Garlick, addressed the issue in the programme and said they have been looking at the logistics of what Europa League football would entail.If there have been any second thoughts about whether a European adventure is really what Burnley want at this stage of their development, then those doubts clearly do not extend to the players judging by their lightning start. Leicester, who gave a full Premier League debut to 20-year-old midfielder Hamza Choudhury, simply could not deal with the energy and physicality of the Clarets, although they did not help themselves.Wes Morgan’s sloppy play allowed Ashley Barnes to play in Wood, who beat Kasper Schmeichel at the second attempt, and three minutes later it was 2-0 as Long headed in Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s corner for his first league goal for Burnley. Leicester will surely argue Harry Maguire did not touch the ball and it should not have been a corner in the first place, but Burnley’s superiority was undeniable.It took the Foxes 14 minutes to mount an attack, with Nick Pope making sure Riyad Mahrez’s deflected shot did not cross the line as he grasped the ball, and had Danny Simpson not headed away Matt Lowton’s cross then Wood would surely have grabbed a third for the hosts.But Leicester slowly found their game and probably should have made at least one of their first-half chances count. The in-form Vardy had two headers, one tamely wide and the other straight at Pope.The keeper did superbly to block and then hold onto a Mahrez header after he got a run on his marker to meet Demarai Gray’s cross before, with the last action of the half, Mahrez curled a free-kick just wide.Gareth Southgate was among the crowd and the England manager would again have been impressed by Pope, who saved from Vardy in the 62nd minute as Leicester created their first real opening of the second half and proved a safe pair of hands all afternoon.Martin Atkinson waved away appeals for a penalty when Jack Cork appeared to handle the ball, with replays suggesting the Burnley man was just outside the penalty area, while at the other end a wild challenge from the substitute Kelechi Iheanacho on Aaron Lennon right on the edge of the area also went unpunished.Moments later Iheanacho created Leicester’s goal, driving forward against a retreating Burnley defence before playing in Vardy, who smashed in his 20th of the season.The visitors piled on the pressure but could not find an equaliser and suffered a blow in the closing moments when Schmeichel was hurt in a challenge by Barnes and had to be replaced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/172a8b5f68766841c8fd4acb076ccc91a5790d5c/7_197_2915_1750/master/2915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b97fd69af3681bbdb4b92b577533251b 1240w","title":"crystal palace brighton premier league report","story":"Wilfried Zaha had made clear just how much he relished this occasion in the build-up. “I just want to beat them and then they can be quiet,” he had said earlier in the week. “I get so much stick from them... I want to beat them and then they can just go back to wherever they came from, really.” As it was, it was a player inspired whose two first-half goals and mesmeric display ensured Crystal Palace, for the first time in months, boast breathing space.This was a blistering derby, the goals crammed into a madcap first period but the visitors’ pressure so nearly telling through the latter stages. Chances were missed, Palace suddenly leaning heavily on their goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey to lift them six points clear of the bottom three, before Brighton were eventually seen off. Albion face a daunting run-in of their own in the weeks ahead, for all that their display potentially merited reward here, but will be relieved not to confront Zaha again. A player who loves to scar bitter rivals was serenaded by the home support from the turf at the end. He is propelling Palace to safety.This contest had permitted to degenerate early into a frenzy as much by both teams’ dithering defending as the gloriously raucous atmosphere. Neither side looked assured confronting set-pieces, centre-halves freezing as crosses fizzed into the respective penalty areas.Brighton thought they had eradicated such slackness from their approach over recent weeks, but were undermined horribly by dozy marking within the opening quarter-hour. Palace, apparently keen not to be outdone, immediately handed their rivals a route back into the contest by slumbering at Pascal Gross’ first riposte.Both sides’ defensive midfielders were cautioned in the early exchanges, with each fortunate not to see a second flash of yellow before the interval. The full-backs were just as anxious whenever opposing wingers tore at them, with José Izquierdo tormenting Joel Ward, on only his second appearance since early December, and Zaha enjoying a field day. The helter-skelter was breathless, marked by Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s barnstorming runs from deep and Glenn Murray’s brawn in aerial challenges with James Tomkins and Mamadou Sakho. The former Palace striker had conducted the Brighton team-talk in the huddle prior to kick-off. This game mattered.It was all too chaotic for those in the dugouts to enjoy. The teams had retired at the break with Palace’s advantage slender for all that, when they had hemmed Albion in, they must have felt untouchable. Zaha had tapped the opening goal into an unguarded net after Luka Milivojevic and Loftus-Cheek combined at an early short corner, the Serb’s cross shot flicking off goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to fall invitingly for the winger, standing virtually on the goal-line. The goalkeeper would deny Andros Townsend from distance before another corner, this time flung over by Yohan Cabaye, provoked more confusion. James McArthur saw a shot blocked by Shane Duffy before Tomkins rammed the second past Ryan’s touch.Briefly, this had threatened to be a rout with Brighton seemingly shellshocked, but Palace’s vulnerability at the back was always likely to be punished. Gross’ first corner duly found Lewis Dunk, cleverly muscling space from Sakho, who headed goalwards and Murray, escaping Ward, spun and converted off the crossbar. Their second reward of the afternoon was far slicker in its construction, Jürgen Locadia placing a superbly weighted pass between opponents for Izquierdo to reach as Ward unwisely went to ground. The Colombian calmly curled a fine shot across Hennessey and into the far corner.That had only served to reduce the deficit which, for 10 minutes, had gaped deceptively at two. Milivojevic, a veteran of derbies fiercer than this in Serbia and Greece, was given far too much time to collect and conjure a cross which Zaha, darting beyond Ezequiel Schelotto, headed down and beyond the exposed Ryan. The Ivorian had once scored a header in a play-off semi-final between these opponents. Brighton cursed at the reminder.Yet they boasted enough of a threat here to make amends. Murray would steer a volley marginally wide of an upright from Beram Kayal’s fine centre, with the hosts craving breathing space and familiar anxiety setting in. Albion monopolised the ball, pushing their hosts ever deeper into retreat, with Dale Stephens drawing a save from Hennessey at full stretch. Ward, harassed all afternoon, did well to prod the rebound behind before Murray could convert.Quite how the forward managed to fire a point-blank volley across rather than in goal in stoppage time at the end summed up his luck, with Palace having long since lost all semblance of authority. Even in defeat, the manner in which Brighton finished this game will have heartened manager Chris Hughton, and bodes well for their own survival prospects. For Palace, the relief of the final whistle was palpable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b18e801a7bb50652c101809c9681a0bdeb3f8bb/0_60_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=848c5029cadd4b317a9eb1484c9e7bb7 1240w","title":"huddersfield watford premier league report","story":"Tom Ince was sprung from the bench in the 61st minute with instruction to score the goal that would breathe new life into Huddersfield’s fight for survival. For 30 minutes it did not look like he would succeed but he, like his team-mates this season, did not give up – and in stoppage time he plundered his reward, poking into the net from close range to trigger mass celebrations at the John Smith’s Stadium. That goal, Ince’s second in the league this season, dramatically increases Huddersfield’s chance of staying in the Premier League.David Wagner called beforehand for a renewal of the aggression and intensity that characterised his team’s improbable rise over the last two years and he got it here from the start. The question was whether they could find the inspiration and precision needed to complement their tenacious enterprise. The answer for most of the match was negative, as it has often been for a side that had scored 26 goals in their 33 matches before this one. They made the stronger start here and worked themselves into positions to penetrate but failed to produce a cutting final ball. When they needed a scalpel they had only a plastic spoon. Their lone striker, Steve Mounié, looked hungry but was given little to feed off before being replaced in the 70th minute.Watford were worse for long periods. Theoretically Javi Gracia’s men are not out of the relegation woods themselves but they started here as if convinced they were already safe in practical terms. A ridiculous five-minute spell from Roberto Pereyra summed up their approach. In the 27th minute the Brazilian took the visitors’ first corner and hit it straight out of play. Ninety seconds later he did exactly the same thing. And soon after that he was booked for ing after Jonathan Hogg curtailed a dangerous counter-attack.It was easy to see why Watford have not won away since November, nor even scored in their last six matches on the road before this one. But amid the absurd sequence involving Pereyra, Watford started hinting at a genuine threat, as Abdoulaye Doucouré burst from midfield and supplied Troy Deeney, whose shot from 16 yards was deflected wide. Doucouré sensed blood and began to break forward more regularly, one fierce low drive from the Frenchman forcing a save from Jonas Lössl. Driven on by Doucouré, Watford began to show urgency. The interval came at a good time for Huddersfield.Huddersfield curbed the visitors’ enthusiasm early in the second half but were unable to worry them. Garcia sought to give his team new impetus by introducing Richarlison for Femenía just before the hour. Will Hughes got the message and soon showed some samba skills straight out of Surrey, as the Weybridge native dribbled past three Huddersfield defenders in the box before being foiled by a fourth.Huddersfield attacks had grown rare. Wagner tried to sharpen up his side by introducing Tom Ince and Laurent Depoitre, the latter replacing Mounié as the manager decided against changing formation. Alex Pritchard embarked on a foxy dribble into the Watford box in the 73rd minute but then became too sly – or not sly enough – and got booked for simulation after being halted by Sebastian Prödl. For a moment in the 79th minute Huddersfield thought the referee pointed to the penalty spot after Depoitre went down under an untidy tackle by Craig Cathcart, who was making his first league start in over a year. But no, the official was merely indicating a goal kick.Still, at least Huddersfield were applying pressure again. And they kept doing so. It paid off in stoppage time when Depoitre outmuscled Prödl to prevent the defender from clearing a punt into the box. Jorgensen chased the breaking ball and pulled it back across goal, and Ince reacted fast and stabbed it into the net. A predatory strike that gives Huddersfield a precious lifeline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e361220bd638895ecdfd9b75871b7985663fd/0_92_3104_1862/master/3104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9459f030aa191fec0ee3634a6bd70c31 1240w","title":"southampton chelsea premier league match report","story":"Olivier Giroud came off the bench to score twice as Chelsea stormed back from two goals down to send Southampton one step closer to relegation.A first-half strike from Dusan Tadic was added to by Jan Bednarek on his first start for the Saints, as Mark Hughes looked like claiming a vital first win as the Saints manager. But a decisive intervention by Antonio Conte led to three goals in eight minutes for Chelsea, with Giroud’s brace coming either side of a thumping finish from Eden Hazard.Before Conte and Giroud made their presence felt Chelsea looked to have been meandering to another underwhelming performance that has typified their form since the turn of the year.Southampton looked like they had the spirit and confidence to resist the siren call of the Championship but while three points for Chelsea leaves Champions League qualification still a distance away, Saints have only one win in 20 Premier League games and remain three points from safety with five games left.Southampton’s opening goal typified their first half performance simple enough but made effective through determination. Ryan Bertrand hardly concealed his intentions. The Saints captain was going to run at César Azpilicueta, from his own half, and invited Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to find him with a pass. The Dane duly accepted the invitation and Bertrand won the race and advanced into the Chelsea box. There he held off a second challenge from Azpilicueta and played a pass with the outside of his boot that evaded the advancing Thibaut Courtois. Tadic anticipated faster than the defence and fired the ball low past Gary Cahill into an empty net.This was the sort of spirit Hughes had celebrated in Southampton’s previous performance against Arsenal and it satisfied the St Mary’s crowd too. They sang Tadic’s name, a reminder the forward is popular with the home support, if not always his managers. The Serb was the fulcrum for Saints’ attacking ambitions. Four minutes after the goal he teed up Shane Long to cross to the far post where Courtois only just beat Cédric Soares to the ball.Chelsea’s best chance of the first half fell to Alvaro Morata who met Davide Zappacosta’s back-post header with a flicked effort that went over Alex McCarthy’s bar. It was a chance reflective of their own insipid showing. Chelsea had clearly arrived happy to concede possession and exploit Saints on the counter. When handed possession, they were ponderous and resorted far too often to flicks and feints no better than hopeful. They lacked both the aggression and imagination to assert themselves.Such a level of performance was unlikely to be met by silence by Conte and Chelsea upped their efforts in the second half. They pressed, interacted and were more determined in their passing.Within 15 minutes, however, they were another goal down. Once more it was simple a James Ward-Prowse free-kick 35 yards from goal, floating all the way to the back post and beyond a sprawling Cahill, where Bednarek was waiting to volley home. The centre-half has hardly played since arriving in the summer but he was assured enough to dispatch the ball cleanly beyond Courtois.Conte responded immediately. He replaced Zappacosta and Morata with Pedro and Giroud and changed shape, providing the rare sighting of a Chelsea back four. In the 70th minute, the changes bore fruit as Giroud muscled his way onto a Marcus Alonso cross and powered a header inside McCarthy’s right-hand post. Again determination was the deciding factor.Now came a test of nerves for Saints, who were suddenly penned into their box. Chelsea’s bolstered forward line were now more assertive. Five minutes after Giroud scored, Willian crossed low from the left to find Hazard on the penalty spot. He took a touch and sidefooted the ball high into the net.The game was decided another three minutes later when Willian played a free-kick short to Pedro and his cross was knocked back across goal. Giroud was waiting again and the striker who has such a reputation for determining matches as a substitute, fired low with his left foot past McCarthy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bdc4a3727842061ca5432fab3425c9dfbc9cda5/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc1ab634336ceb014cc081aac9415bb0 1240w","title":"swansea city everton premier league match report","story":"Every point feels precious in the scrap for survival, yet Swansea City will lament the fact that they departed with one, not three, from a game they badly needed to win to allow them to breathe more easily in the relegation battle. A superbly-taken goal from Jordan Ayew at least enabled Swansea to salvage something after Kyle Naughton had put through his own net just before-half time, but this felt like a missed opportunity for Carlos Carvalhal and his players.The Welsh club edged another point clear of the drop zone but slipped two places in the table on an afternoon when they paid a high price for their profligacy in front of goal. Everton, in contrast, remained ninth and it was another of those days when their supporters made it clear that they are far from enamoured with Sam Allardyce and his tactics. The Everton manager’s decision to bring on Ramiro Funes Mori for Yannick Bolasie went down particularly badly with the travelling fans, especially after they had just hit the woodwork and the game was there to be won.Swansea had started extremely brightly, opening Everton up with their slick passing and creating several excellent chances inside the first 30 minutes, yet their failure to take any of those opportunities proved costly as the visitors pilfered the lead shortly before the interval and totally against the run of play.Lukasz Fabianski produced two fine saves to deny Bolasie and then Idrissa Gueye from close-range, but the ball rebounded off Naughton and over the line. Swansea thought they had got away with it but Lee Mason, the referee, received a notification on his wrist via the goal-line technology system and Carvalhal’s team found themselves behind in a game where they should have led.Everton had twice cleared balls off the line in the space of 60 seconds earlier in the first half. Leighton Baines seemed to know little about it when Jordan Ayew’s shot deflected off his heel and behind after Tom Carroll had broken away on the right following a Swansea counter-attack. From the corner that followed Cenk Tosun nodded Federico Fernández’s header off the line.Everton seemed unable to stem the flow of white shirts and there was another reprieve for Allardyce’s team in the 26th minute. Jordan Ayew’s lovely first-time pass released Andre Ayew, his brother, through on goal but the forward’s shot was tame and straight at Jordan Pickford, who was able to easily save.Swansea had another couple of openings early in the second half. Carroll’s ing header was saved by Pickford and five minutes later the Everton goalkeeper clawed Andre Ayew’s attempt over the bar. Everton, however, were starting to see a bit more of the ball and Gueye, totally unmarked, wastefully headed a cross from Theo Walcott wide of the far post.With the clock ticking away, Carvalhal knew that he had to roll the dice. Tammy Abraham replaced Ki sung-Yueng as Swansea desperately pressed for an equaliser. Tosun, remarkably, cleared another header off the line, this time from Alfie Mawson, and Swansea must have wondered what they needed to do to score. The answer came via a slice of good fortune. Carroll’s mis-hit volley landed at the feet of Jordan Ayew, who took a touch before drilling an unerring shot across Pickford and into the far corner.With the game now stretched, Everton came desperately close to regaining the lead 15 minutes from time. Tosun crossed from the right and Seamus Coleman rattled the crossbar when it appeared easier to score. Allardyce’s response was to replace Bolasie with Funes Mori – much to the annoyance of their supporters – presumably to try to shut up shop, yet Swansea could and should have scored again. Jordan Ayew’s astute knockdown from Carroll’s free-kick implored Abraham to score but the substitute screwed his shot over the bar from no more than eight yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7ff283b39b3086ac98c10fce4e7e4784447dcb/119_159_2677_1606/master/2677.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5d17af8fe4a6f54aa4d946a90032a216 1240w","title":"crystal palace v brighton swansea v everton and more live","story":"Crystal Palace hung on after a thrilling first half, Tom Ince grabs injury-time winner for Huddersfield as relegation picture clearsOk, that just about closes out the afternoon’s action from me. No, I didn’t back Tiger Roll. Here’s Ewan Murray from Hampden Park. Burnley for Europe? It’s happening. Dom Fifield was at Selhurst ParkThe reports are coming in. Here’s Stuart James from Swansea.Barcelona beat Valencia 2-1, setting a new record. After the Lord Mayor’s Show for Liverpool? They play Bournemouth at 5.30pm UK time. Rob Smyth with the coverage. The Grand National is five minutes away from starting. Join Niall McVeigh. The big comeback of the day came as AFC Wimbledon, fighting against relegation from League One, fought back from two goals down to Walsall to win in sixth minute of extra time. In the Football League, the biggest losers are Bury, who got relegated from League One after losing 3-2 to Northampton. Cardiff climbed back into the top two of the Championship but must wait on Fulham’s later game against Brentford. A win over Derby kept Burton alive while both Barnsley and Sunderland fight on after draws. There was a lengthy delay as Middlesbrough eventually beat Bristol City to climb up to fifth. So, as it stands in the Premier League, 17th-placed Swansea are five points clear of the bottom three. With Crystal Palace a point above them. Huddersfield are now in 14th. West Brom play Manchester United on Sunday while Stoke play West Ham on Monday. In La Liga, Barcelona are winning 2-0 against Valencia, after goals from Luis Suárez and Samuel Umtiti. Not quite what Swansea wanted and still work to do, but Southampton’s loss in the early match was already good news for them. Jamie Vardy went close towards the end but Burnley’s hold on seventh was hugely strengthened by a fifth successive win. Glenn Murray missed an absolute sitter for Brighton at the death. In the Championship, Cardiff now lead 2-0 at Norwich while Barnsley have equalised against Bolton. Faint hopes alive. That’s Huddersfield up to 35 points. Will that be enough for them? Bury now 3-2 down to Northampton and they will be heading down to League Two. Crystal Palace v Brighton - first half the best of the season, second half will be broadcast last on Match of the Day? Brighton have been pushing for an equaliser. Tom Ince gets the goal in added time for Huddersfield. That’s the one they wanted and the mascot has joined the party. That would push the Terriers to 35 points. Wayne Rooney has been subbed off again for Everton. This time, no rude words, stamping of his feet or throwing club garments to the ground. Massive goal in the Championship where Cardiff have just scored at Norwich, a goal from Kenneth Zohore which takes them back into the automatic promotion spots. Even worse news for Barnsley. They have conceded a goal from Craig Noone to make it 2-1 to Bolton. Bad news for Barnsley in conceding a penalty to Bolton. Adam Le Fondre stepped up to score it. That would keep them in the bottom three of the Championship. But Grimsby have a penalty and they have scored it. Grimsby 2-2 Barnet, Mitch Rose, brother of Danny, got it. At the bottom of the Football League, Barnet have a 2-1 lead at Grimsby and could be within two points of safety. Sunderland doomwatch: Reading make it 2-2 and it’s Yann Kermogant with the header. Middlesbrough go 2-1 up against Bristol City, through Daniel Ayala. A vital goal in the play-off race. Tranmere have just scored against Aldershot in the National League , which means Macclesfield Town’s champagne is on ice. They will probably now have to wait for promotion to the Football League. They need a win from one of their final two matches. Tranmere have to win all five of their last five. Seamus Coleman has hit the crossbar for Everton at Swansea. At last, some attacking for Big Sam’s entertainers. Who else but Jamie Vardy? He’s in thrashing form, scoring his 20th of the season and his 10th in 12 matches. It had been coming, and was totally deserved. The younger Ayew volleys in a mishit cross from Tom Carroll. Burton 3-1 Derby now. They will live to fight another day, and this could be a famous victory for Nigel Clough over his old club. What did I say about Huddersfield? Not much, actually. Here’s another view. Sunderland doomwatch: Nope, not a bit of it, as Sunderland are now leading 2-1 with a rare header, indeed a rare goal, his first in 104 matches, from Lee Cattermole. Huddersfield having to do plenty of defending at home to Watford when they need to be on the attack. Tom Ince just had a shot saved and so did Steve Mounie. Nick Pope just made another great save for Burnley to deny Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy. It’s still 2-0 to Burnley. Glenn Murray has just gone close for Brighton and it could have been 3-3 with Crystal Palace. In the Championship, Barnsley, third from bottom, are fighting for their lives and leading Bolton 1-0. Tom Carroll and Andre Ayew have forced saves from Jordan Pickford as Swansea push for an equaliser against Everton. This is bearing the signs of a classic Allardyce smash and grab affair. Here’s a match report from the earlier Premier League game. That late Chelsea surge was a disaster for Southampton. Not much happening between Huddersfield and Watford at the moment. Huddersfield need to push for a win here. Reminder that Town have Everton, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal to play.

The rebound comes to Hazard, who is offside.55 min Two good efforts from Chelsea. Fabregas’s sizzling volley is blocked, and moments later Hazard squeezes a shot towards the near post that is pushed round by McCarthy.54 min Long almost makes it 2-0 with a superb solo counter-attack. He ran behind the defence onto Hojbjerg’s long pass and seemed to be pushed over just outside the area by the covering Christensen. Long burst straight to his feet, moved the ball onto his left foot and mishit a shot that looped towards goal before being tipped over by Courtois.49 min “Wait a minute, Mac Millings can’t bring himself to hate anyone in football anymore?” says Matt Dony. “So where does he get his enjoyment from?

You know you’ve grown up when you turn it all inward.48 min Southampton win an early corner on the left. Ward-Prowse is one of the best set-piece takers in the league and this is another beauty.

Chelsea have been half asleep. See you in 10 minutes for the second half!45+2 min “It would be a great shame if Southampton go down so I hope they win today,” says Kira Nelson. “A great club with a great academy. They have produced so many world class players and used to play such attractive attacking football. I remember the Southampton of a few years ago when they demolished Sunderland 8-0. Where has that Southampton gone? They just need the right manager to give them their mojo back, so they deserve the chance to set matters straight. Not to mention, where would Liverpool get their players from?”I think your second question answered the first one.45+1 min Three minutes of added time. Fabregas’s shot deflects just over the bar, and Christensen flicks a header wide from the resulting corner. It wasn’t much of a chance.45 min In Alonso’s defence, I think the tackle was more clumsy than malicious - he had to jump over the grounded Fabregas and then couldn’t adjust his feet before his studs ploughed into Long. But it was a bad tackle and he should certainly have been booked.44 min Ward-Prowse is booked for a vigilante foul on Alonso, who had just got away with a nasty tackle on Long. He jumped studs first into the back of Long’s leg. I don’t think Mike Dean saw it.43 min Hojbjerg is penalised for a scissor tackle on Zappacosta, and then hoofs the ball into the crowd in frustration. Mike Dean books him for one or the other, I’m not sure which. 42 min A lovely, dipping free-kick from Ward-Prowse is headed wide by Yoshida, who was under pressure and couldn’t twist his neck enough to ert the ball towards goal. It was a decent chance.40 min Southampton have been so much better since the goal, which gave them an intravenous injection of confidence. Chelsea are still dominating possession, but Southampton look more dangerous on the break.39 min “If we win today (can hardly believe I’m daring to entertain the thought) then we have a small chance of staying up, that’s as far as I dare go,” says Arwen Verrall. “Somewhat out of the habit of dealing with the great escape years but how quickly it comes flooding back.” If you need to win the last game at home to Manchester City, you should register Le Tissier. He would touch the ball twice in the first 89 minutes before roofing a matchwinning volley from 30 yards.38 min Ward-Prowse’s smart snapshot from 20 yards is well saved by Courtois, sprawling to his right. He gets to his feet to save Tadic’s feeble follow-up, though that wouldn’t have counted as he was offside.36 min Long moseys infield from the left, realises he has no relevant support and decides to shoot from 25 yards.

A coffee with a piece of fruit: apple, orange, banana … And maybe a couple of biscuits. It is depends on what I’m racing as the following day – if it’s lightweight, then I have to eat less. It’s all about weight management it plays on your mind all the time. If you wake up five to six pounds heavier, you know that somewhere down the line you’re just going to have to lose it again, so even if you try eating a bit more normally while you’re on holiday, you tend to get back on to your working diet very quickly.Usually at about 11am – you don’t want to eat a full meal between rides, so it’s tiny: two to four chicken nuggets or a chicken wrap. I imagine my stomach is fairly small, but you do settle into it. We’re so active there’s no sitting around. We get 10 days off in August, but apart from that, we’re racing all year round, always on the clock.I still live with my mum, and she looks after me very well. I love pasta – carbonara especially – but I avoid eating too many carbs. So it’s usually chicken – stews, grilled, wrapped in bacon – or steak, rare. With two to three veg – spinach, carrot. My mum’s very trad, and I’m not very fussy.Lots of sweets. I use up a lot of energy, so I often need an energy boost. I love Haribo Tangfastics, but I’ll have anything really. I have a really sweet tooth. And the odd packet of crisps – beef Hula Hoops or purple Monster Munch. I spend a lot of my day in the car – about 60,000 miles a year – so going to the garage is a bit of a nightmare. I could buy everything. Once every two to three days, I’ll have a can of Coke, but most of the time it’s a builder’s tea with a good few sugars, with maybe a biscuit if there are any. And Robinson’s squash – apple and blackcurrant – with fizzy water.

Today’s recipe happens to be my perfect slice. It’s packed full of my favourite sweet ingredients: dates, dark chocolate, coffee and cardamom, built on a base of bananas for density, and topped with ganache and flowers just for fun.Pour the ganache over the cake while it’s on a wire rack for a clean look or, for a more natural style, put it on a plate and let the ganache run down the sides. Or skip the ganache entirely, and turn this into more of a morning or afternoon cake.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4.

Boos aside, the films were a critical success. But they symbolise a threat to a well-established business model for the industry. This year the festival’s organisers, who insist that films can only be entered for the competition if they are screened in French cinemas, have said Netflix can only show films out of competition at the festival, which takes place next month. Netflix will not do this because under French law, films cannot be streamed until three years after their cinema release in the country.The British actor Helen Mirren joined the fray on Thursday, claiming that the rise of streaming has been “devastating” for film-makers such as her husband, the US film director Taylor Hackford, who want their work to be “watched in a cinema with a group of people”. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s head of content, highlighted the ision between “Netflix-film-makers” and the traditional industry when he said he feared that to show up at all in the south of France could mean “having our films and film-makers treated disrespectfully”.Netflix has never been overly keen to make its films available in cinemas. At best it likes a simultaneous release, such as acclaimed African civil war drama Beasts of No Nation, whereby some cinemas show the film while it is released to subscribers at the same time. Most US cinema chains refused to screen the film, which Netflix bought for $12m (£8.4m) but made less than $100,000 at the box office. Netflix’s streaming-first model threatens traditional film distribution that allows cinema chains to attract audiences because they have historically always enjoyed a significant exclusive period as the only place to catch a new release.Having disrupted the model for TV broadcasters by making schedules irrelevant and grabbing millions of viewers at the same time, Netflix is now making a run at Hollywood. It is directing a significant chunk of its $8bn budget at making 80 films this year. That is equivalent to the same number of releases the top five Hollywood studios will deliver in 2018. Netflix’s deep pockets have lured Hollywood stars such as Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, stars of the company’s recent $100m sci-fi film Bright, which is an indication of its intent.Nevertheless, the cinema industry is fighting back by investing heavily in making movie-going an experience that canot be replicated by staying at home on the couch. It is investing in leather reclining seats, VIP areas and high-quality sound and picture technology.“Our demise has been predicted for the last 80 years – with TV, VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, now with the internet – and we are not complacent,” said Tim Richards, the chief executive of Vue International, a top-three cinema chain. “Why do people go to restaurants, football games, live music – they want to get out of the house, they are social – and it is the same with film. Never under-estimate the demand for watching a movie on the big screen.”While the UK cinema industry seems in robust shape there are those that believe the global sector is living on borrowed time, on the brink of the kind of wholesale digital disruption that forever altered the music industry and revolutionised the way we watch TV.As a smaller cinema chain and distributor, Curzon already offers its films on its own video-on-demand service the same day as a release in one of its 20 UK cinemas. And Curzon has also done deals with Netflix to put its movies including Okja and Mudbound on the big screen. “We do want to continue to open cinemas and build footfall, but we don’t want to be big in the UK,” he said. “We are much more like the Apple stores, a means to an end rather than an end in themselves. I believe the future lies with Amazon and Netflix, that is where the funding is coming from for most of the content in the coming years, the tech platforms. The industry needs to stop seeing them as our enemy. I see them as my friends.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b902566ef90c444afeceb5eecf0df8235b474c23/0_0_3000_1997/master/3000.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09d6ab6dbdb244b64772828329325e1d 6000w","title":"world press photo contest 2018 the winning pictures","story":"Highlights from this year’s competition include Ronaldo Schemidt’s image of a man on fire, which took the top prize"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/914c7c5584d8253f5f3d644b3e867e6aac46d2be/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3a173590284604ff8395da188fb326c2 1240w","title":"dockless bike hire scheme ofo mobike santander cycles","story":"City dwellers will soon be unable to ignore the flood of dockless hire bikes hitting Britain’s streets, courtesy of two Chinese companies, Ofo and Mobike. Leeds is next in line, with Ofo placing 1,000 bikes in the city next month, Mobike is expanding around Manchester, while in London more and more boroughs are greeting the arrival of the yellow and red cycles.The concept is simple: you need a smartphone and a credit card. Download the app, load your credit card details, hire a bike for a low fee (usually 50p, but more of that later), then locate it on a map on your phone. Once at the bike, scan the QR code to unlock it and you’re off. At your destination find somewhere sensible to leave it, then lock it – that’s it.The reality, of course, is a little different – damaged and stolen cycles have littered canals, bins and back gardens, with residents complaining about clogged pathways and commuters angry about pile-ups at stations.The firms insist that after early setbacks, behaviour is improving and fewer bikes are being lost to vandalism. However, Mobike said last week that it is raising its fee from 50p to 69p for half an hour to encourage people to “treat the bikes respectfully” and park them better.So are they a cheap and cheerful alternative to cars, buses and taxis? Or an uncomfortable ride? We tested three services and found that Ofo easily beat Mobike for usability, while Santander Cycles is the only option, for now, for riders 1.83m (6ft) or above in height.Cost: 69p for every 30 minutes, 50p in London. Initial £1 deposit. Longer-term passes: £9.90 a month, £24.90 for 90 days, or £89.90 for a year.Ride: I’m 1.83m tall. The saddle, raised to its maximum, was still so low the bicycle was unrideable. There are no gears, so going uphill is heavy work. It felt unwieldy despite its modern design, with enclosed disc brakes and airless tyres. I asked some shorter colleagues to do a test ride Miles Brignall and Lisa O’Carroll found the seating position acceptable, but both declared the bikes too heavy.Sign-up: I downloaded the app over Google Play, with the contract and card details kept with Beijing Mobike Technology Co Ltd. The app required location access, which I agreed to, and offered a yesno for access to photos, media and to “make and manage phone calls”. I said “no” to these and the app still worked. It pre-selected a £9.90 monthly pass, but I was able to select the 50p-a-journey option instead. It was better than Ofo in warnings to leave the bike in a suitable place.Bike locating: Lots of available cycles immediately populated my phone screen, but the Guardian is in King’s Cross so that’s understandable. Unfortunately, it sent me to the wrong side of the canal for my first bike hire.Score: 510. Must do better. Its PRs are keen to point out that Mobike 3.0 is launching, with higher saddles for the European market. Once in place I’d consider using it, but until then it’s pointless for me.Cost: 50p for every 30 minutes, capped at £5 a day. No deposit. No passes either, but these are likely to be launched soon.Ride: Far better than Mobike. The saddle height was a little higher although still too low for me. It is more of a traditional-style bike, with three gears, so riding uphill is better. It felt lighter than the Mobike and although the bright yellow is ugly, it’s undoubtedly more visible to car drivers. Brignall and O’Carroll also found the ride lighter and easier.Sign-up: Again, I downloaded the app via Google Play – the contract is with Yellow Bike (Beijing) Data Services Co Ltd. It required access to contacts, location, photos and media, with no optout – you had to accept all these for the app to download. It has a simpler sign-up process, but less information than Mobike about pricing and scoring, where you are penalised if you leave the bike in a wrong geolocation, such as Camden – right next to Islington – which is yet to give Ofo permission for its bikes.Bike locating: Again, there are lots close to me although maybe a tad fewer than Mobike. I found the closest one easily.Score: 710. It needs to improve the frame and saddle height to make it acceptable to European customers. The PRs are keen to point out that they have begun replacing early models with ones that have a seating position that’s around 10cm higher. I tried one and they are much better, but will still be a challenge for anyone much taller than me.Cost: We tested Santander Cycles in London – rates in other cities vary. There is a £2 access fee for 24 hours, so long as no single journey exceeds 30 minutes. An annual unlimited-use pass is £90.Ride: Heavy but manageable. Saddles can be adjusted to suit nearly all heights. The cycles have three gears and the lights are better than Mobike and Ofo. The big design flaw is the front basket, which is little more than a bungee-style cord – a pain when you have some shopping. Mobike’s and Ofo’s are both simpler.Sign-up: You don’t need a smartphone or an app as you can sign up at the docking station with a debit or credit card. The on-screen process takes a few minutes to give a printout of a code that releases the bike. Annual-pass holders are sent a release key, which is quicker.Bike locating: A big drawback is that you must find a docking station (although Santander’s app can help) and hope bikes will be available. At your destination, it’s fingers crossed again that a dock will be free. Transport for London tries to redistribute bikes\u0026nbsparound the system, but not always successfully.Score: 810. These are good cycles and far more are available if you are just using them in central London, especially with a key-pass. But outside the city centre (north of King’s Cross or south of OvalKennington) there are almost no docking stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d271d4782e7faeac50515891b6d395b3f60585f/0_0_5448_3268/master/5448.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1775626f507611f797cd9153fada7711 1240w","title":"wonga mark 2 new breed of payday lenders oakam","story":" The worst of the payday lenders, famed for offering short-term loans at sky-high interest rates, may have faded away, but vulnerable consumers are still being targeted with offers of loans with four-figure APRs.Debt charity StepChange says 1.4m lower-income households resorted to high-cost credit to meet living costs last year – up from 1.1m in 2016.It found those using such credit tend to be on low incomes and often in insecure jobs with irregular work patterns.

With her new album Joyride, has her moment finally arrived?Halfway through school at California’s Crescenta Valley High, budding actor Tinashe Jorgensen Kachingwe made a new best friend. She was delighted to have found this new acquaintance, and sad when she had to leave school for two months to shoot a TV movie, Cora Unashamed. On her return to Crescenta, she discovered her BFF didn’t like her any more. No one did. Her friend turned into a bully and created a We Hate Tinashe group of which she was leader. She would ring Kachingwe at home to describe exactly how she was going to “fuck her up” at school the next day. She, like everyone else, didn’t like the fact Kachingwe was on TV. “There were groups of girls who would throw food at me in the hallways,” she remembers. “Like, cereal. And milk. Gross stuff like that. People were pretty mean.” Despite such torrential tormenting, the 25-year-old – now the singer who goes simply by Tinashe – is remarkably sanguine about these experiences. “It led me to be hyper-focused on what I wanted from life and that was how I was able to stay happy and not get depressive as a kid,” she says in the cafe of New York’s New Museum, where we meet to discuss her long-overdue second album proper, Joyride. “It’s easy to feel like the whole world is against you as a kid, but the world is bigger than school.” It’s a lesson Tinashe has retained, applying the same sage standards to “what people are saying online” about her life and music. “Everything will get better. You just have to keep focusing on what makes you happy and what fulfils you. For me that’s making music and performing.” Does she still see those girls? “Fuckin’ bitches,” she grins. “Where are they now?”Although people no longer chuck food at Tinashe’s head, they do throw a lot of shade her way. They question why her records don’t sell. With her catalogue a combination of subtle, silky trap and rap-infused tracks and glossy hits (Player the DJ Mustard co-produced 2 On her collaboration with Snakehips on All My Friends) critics say she’s either too pop or too R\u0026ampB – or not enough of either. “I think genres should just die,” she says. “As a human being, you don’t limit yourself to being one thing or other I don’t think people think of themselves in that way. It’s the same for how I present my music, how I listen to music, how I dress, how I live my life. It’s not black and white. Who you are is actually much more complex.”The last time she spoke to the Guardian the internet disseminated Tinashe’s thoughts on colourism and sexism (“Sometimes I feel like I don’t fully fit into the black community they don’t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman,” being one quote). Television host Wendy Williams delivered a snippy three-minute bit about the interview. “She’s blaming Rihanna and Beyoncé for her lack of success?” Williams asked. “You have no one to blame but yourself, Tinashe. You gotta make your own path. Mariah, Drake and Alicia Keys are all biracial, so what’s your next excuse?”Meanwhile, fans and trolls lined up to wonder where the album was and whether it might sell more than her “critically acclaimed” (translation: didn’t sell well) debut, 2014’s Aquarius. This is another aspect of “the business” that Tinashe has little time for. “You’re either at this super-high level of fame and dominating the whole world or you’re a failure, which is just not accurate,” she insists. “My definition of success has changed over the course of this album. I’ve learned that making the music and art and videos I want to make, that’s enough for me. I don’t feel like I need all the accolades.”It has taken Tinashe time to reach such a place of self-satisfaction, however. With more than 200 tracks recorded and “numerous” iterations of Joyride in the vault, the album seemed destined never to see the light of day. Finally, last summer, Tinashe let go a little. She moved into a new home in the Hollywood Hills with sweeping views of LA and turned the guesthouse into a studio. She invited friends, producers, writers, graphic designers and artists over and together they zeroed in on the music, artwork and videos.“It was a really big turning point for me because I was able to focus creatively and get all my thoughts in one place. It really gave me perspective on what I’d already created and what I still needed to work on. It was more focused, more purposeful.”Joyride is a delightfully sleazy bop, full of red-light R\u0026ampB, woozy hip-hop and lyrics that linger on hook-ups and getting high. “It’s a snapshot of when I wasn’t in a relationship and I was trying to find myself,” she says. “That sense of confidence and almost braggadociousness was something that I wanted to express on the album – ‘I don’t need anybody, I’m good.’” She is now in a relationship with the basketball player Ben Simmons, another reason she’s living life a little lighter. “Ben has been an important part of being able to let go of the album creatively. Because you can get crazy,” she says.Funnily enough, it looks as if Joyride could just be a hit the Offset-featuring single No Drama clocked up a million views in one day, while the delightfully tactile Me So Bad and title track Joyride are streaming at rapid rates. The album is self-assured, a bit frivolous but occasionally weighty – such as on Easy on Me, which voices her frustrations with politics in the United States. The track, an interlude, is one of two Tinashe has produced on Joyride, having taught herself Pro Tools when she was 17. “When I first got on the scene I was honestly shocked that I could work for a whole year with hundreds of engineers and producers and not one would be another woman. We need to see more representation.”Having been in the entertainment industry for so much of her life – as both an actor (including her role as Celeste Burnett on Charlie Sheen’s Two and a Half Men) and a singer (who could forget her stint in the Stunners, a shortlived girlband signed to Columbia in 2007) – Tinashe has a deep understanding of the seismic shifts occurring at the moment. She believes, however, that the music business has a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the entertainment industry when it comes to the #MeToo movement.“Mostly it’s people’s perceptions of what it means to be a female artist and how you deal with your sexuality and people respecting your creative opinion. I haven’t had any straight-up, very outwardly sexist experiences in the music industry I’ve been very lucky. Maybe one session where I had to walk out where I was uncomfortable. But for the most part I’ve worked with really great people. The issue is really a systemic, cultural one that impacts across the board.”It’s time to leave the New Museum – Tinashe has a stack of CDs to sign before getting up at 4am to do Good Morning America. Before she goes, however, I wonder if she is really as happy, as calm, as sorted as she appears?“Honestly, yes. I think people respect me as an artist now.

Communities and housing secretary Sajid Javid also rents out property, while Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, rents out two properties, according to the registerThe foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, the minister without portfolio, Brandon Lewis – who is also the Conservative party chairman – and the Welsh minister, Alun Cairns, also own and rent out a property, according to the register.There is no suggestion that the ministers are in breach of the ministerial code.Hunt’s declared property interests are comfortably larger than any of the other ministers listed. He set up Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo which have since bought seven flats in Alexandra Wharf, a redevelopment project on the Southampton waterfront worth £40m.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only his wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.Kathryn Stone, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday and will consider it early next week, a spokesperson said.Labour said Hunt’s actions represented a “serious breach”. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: “This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state’s position at the heart of Theresa May’s government.”Guardian inquiries have established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor.The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire.Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency.A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase”.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m. The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the ministerial code. “We consider the matter closed.” Dr Alex May, the academic who spotted Hunt’s omissions and whose email on 28 March prompted a change to Hunt’s Companies House filing, told the Guardian that the health secretary’s office only admitted wrongdoing after he went public with the information on Friday. “There is a lack of scrutiny from Companies House,” he said. “It allows people to break the law, sometimes unwittingly.”• This article was amended on 14 April 2018.

We decode the new rules for saying helloTwo or three times a week, I leave my young son with a childminder before taking my daughter to nursery. It used to be that, when first meeting the minder or the teacher who was about to take charge of them for the day, I’d grip their upper arm in greeting – a gesture by which I think I meant “Hello” and “Thank you”, as well as something like: “Please don’t let anything happen to them in the foam zone or during scissors time.” A handshake felt too formal in the circumstances, a wave too cold, an embrace too much. There aren’t any cheat sheets or obvious etiquette guides to steer our behaviour in such moments, though, so, like a lot of people, I panicked, winged it, and evolved a near-random habit of greeting that after a while I came to queasily trust was acceptable. Actually, I was feeling pretty confident about that arm squeeze, until I mentioned it to friends.“You do what?” They were incredulous. “You grip the teacher where?”“It’s the forearm,” someone said. “You can only put your hand on the forearm in a relationship like this.”“You can squeeze,” someone said, “lightly.”Someone else said: “Why are you touching them at all? Unless these teachers are, like, your close friends? Or your siblings?”Brits are all over the place when it comes to our methods of physical introduction: inconsistent, contrarian, unsatisfiable. The handshake, a staple to Person A, can seem like barbarian overreach to Person B. Getting a new job might mean trading a huggy workplace for one that’s frostily hands-free, or vice versa, without this switch in protocol being properly explained till you’re there, squeezed under a boss’s armpit, or mutely flicking up eyebrows at some distant colleagues wearing headphones.Perhaps it’s no surprise that we’re puzzled, and puzzling, when it comes to this stuff, given our history. Fiercely codified Edwardian mores were force-fed through two wars, and what jumble of habits remained after that pushed on through postwar immigration, the eroding of an overripe class system, waves of sexual and political change, shifting inclinations to imitate Europeans and Americans, the warping effects of communication by computer and text message, as well as those recent pause-for-thought moments brought about by the #MeToo campaign. Not to mention the endless seesawing shifts in fashion that brought in and out of use the customised handshake, stratagems for clutching, the peace sign, air-kissing. What a mess. What a minefield.After my fright with the upper-arm squeeze, I wondered what else I was doing differently from other people. So over a few weeks I surveyed more than 50 people on the subject, all British or Britain-based but of different ages, backgrounds, sexualities, regions, cultures and employment. The youngest respondent was 19, the oldest 79. Some people had been quietly stewing on these things for years, and others had never properly analysed their actions before. I asked about habits and uncertainties, where people were inconsistent and where they wished for greater clarity, and what suggestions they had to help us normalise this shambles.I heard many intriguing admissions, offered on the condition of anonymity, for instance about the lifelong best friends who never touched in greeting (“We bow our heads slightly”) or the people who’d never so much as hugged their fathers (“I’m not sure his body knows how to contort itself into a hugging position”). People talked me through Ghanaian hand-slaps (“You do it with enthusiasm and gusto, and then click the other person’s fingers”) and Turkish hand-kisses (“You kiss the back of an elder’s hand and place it on your forehead briefly”).Only on one subject was there broad agreement: mums. Mums get a hug and a kiss in greeting for most people this was the one uncomplicated, unhesitating transaction that came naturally.A number of those I interviewed described an everyday clumsiness around their siblings (“My brothers get a nod and an ‘All right’, unless it’s Eid or a funeral or one of us is leaving on a massive trip”) but this was nothing like the pickle people got into around their fathers. A male market trader told me that he and his dad had settled on “three to four kisses per year” – their difficulty was knowing if and when an occasion was exceptional enough to use them. A schoolboy was unbothered (“I don’t use any means of physical contact to greet my father”) but among older men a note of yearning was more common if they did not feel able to kiss or embrace their dads: “I sort of shake hands with him, but then hold the hand, briefly.”A TV producer said: “I’ll usually greet my dad with a wave and a nod. He’s always been a big disciplinarian, typically African and proud, and living in England for over 35 years hasn’t changed that.” Among those who were comfortable kissing their fathers, there were other complications. “My dad gets an awkward hug and he kisses my head,” said a female respondent. A standup comedian said she’d had to come to terms with funny glances coming her way whenever she gave her dad “a quick peck on the lips. It does seem odd to other people, but we’ve always done it and it’s never led to incest.”I was most struck by the response from a security guard, who said that before his father died they used to greet each other with the same routine: firm handshake, followed by sloppy double kiss. It was as if the handshake, like some formal red tape that had to be taken care of, allowed them into a looser intimacy.A teacher was unabashed: hugs are in. “Teaching is like that: at the end of the week, it’s hugs for close colleagues.” Those who worked in offices were more likely to balk at contact. “I like a wave and a ‘Hey’,” said a solicitor, which seemed the view of the majority. In offices where the no-contact greeting is standard, the rules seem to get compromised after any sort of holiday or break from the daily routine. “It’s chaos. I’ve kissed ears, shaken an extended fist, had my handshake crushed against a groin as they’ve hugged me.”People note the inconsistencies brought about by after-work drinks or seasonal parties – particularly saying goodbye at the end. The boss at a management consultancy said: “I often take a faux phone call, to escape the milling.” Quite a few women made the same complaint: why should they be expected to follow up a handshake with a kiss, only because they were women? A film-maker said: “Posh men do this – they pull you in by the hand, and once they instigate it, it’s very hard to get out of.” One recent improvement, though: “I have definitely had my knee patted a lot less since the #MeToo movement.” The solicitor added: “I would far prefer it if it was customary for women as well as men to do just handshakes it would put women on the same footing from the get-go.”‘High five, without fail’: other people’s childrenPeople spoke of improvising their own special technique for greeting children, anything from fond to frosty, but there was no consensus. “Head pat… Hair ruffle… Enthusiastic wave… A curt nod and a please-move-on-now look… I kneel down to their level and ask if they are all right… High five, without fail, normally making them miss the first time… Ironic handshake… High five and a lot of noise… I sort of lean into their faces and boom ‘Hello’ in what’s probably quite a distressing way.”Bending to a child’s level felt important to people. But a father of three smartly pointed out: “They don’t care either way.”A 19-year-old told me that “physical contact among people my age is optional. We settle for a simple ‘Hi’ or ‘Hello’, unless you haven’t seen each other in a while, are best friends or in a romantic relationship.” Most older respondents stated a fondness for personalised greetings. “If I really like someone, I give their back a rub while I hug, like they’re a good horse. For those I’m closest to, I’ll pause after the initial hug and then squeeze.”Stress levels began to rise, people said, when it came to managing these customised hellos all at once. Respondents spoke about circling living rooms or pubs, trying to remember their levels of intimacy with friends on the fly. “One- or two-arm hug? Arm clutches? Or no arm clutches?” A few told stories about awkwardly upgrading their greetings package so that it matched that of the cherished person present – and suddenly there they were in long, rocking bear-hugs with near strangers. Friends’ partners, apparently, present special difficulties. “Strangely dodgy territory,” one respondent said, matching the feelings of about a quarter of those I interviewed. People reported that greetings might come flavoured with frisson (“Sometimes one or other of you goes for the extra kiss and it produces that moment, where you almost kiss on the lips”) or something like stage fright (“There’s a sort of hallway freeze”). A Muslim woman said: “I’m not supposed to have that much physical contact with dudes and I used to find it very weird to get kissed on the cheek by my ex-husband’s mates.” A mother of two said: “My best friend’s husband makes it clear he doesn’t want to be kissed. He sticks out his cheek and says a loud air-kissing ‘Mwah’ which is a rigmarole we go through about once a fortnight.”Apart from a sweet, softly spoken poetry academic, who felt that an absolute bone-crusher of a handshake “should be taught in schools”, the men I interviewed mostly hated having their fingers vice-squashed in greeting. “Deeply twatty,” said a chief executive from North Yorkshire. A charity worker agreed: “It’s so pathetic and yet it feels inappropriate to call them out on it in public.” A van driver admitted: “I was once advised to firm up my handshake. Some people associate it with success and confidence. I associate it with fear.”There was a surprising amount of sympathy for the strong handshake among female respondents. A student from Manchester said: “I quite like it, it feels important”, and a TV producer said: “I like them. But you need to engage with your eyes as well or don’t bother.” Absolutely nobody came out in defence of the alternative. “Don’t slide your hand towards me like a limp fish,” said the female ad exec. “Commit.”There was a high degree of paranoia when it came to the number of kisses: a question to which the answers displayed more class- and geography-based conflict than anywhere else.A police officer said: “Single, always the single kiss”, while a screenwriter gently suggested otherwise: “Maybe two if they initiate.” An architect approached the matter in terms of aesthetics: “There’s got to be something about being symmetrical, right?” An entrepreneur who’d trial-and-errored his way through the numbers had concluded that “the single is creepy, the triple absurd”. (A charity worker disagreed. “I love the novelty value of a triple.”) An academic noted with approval the method of a colleague “who says, as she goes in, ‘I take three’”, while an editor just sounded tired: “I’m not a fan of the kiss on the cheek as a greeting full stop. It’s a posh-white-people thing.” Actually, a lot of people said something like this. A post office worker stated: “Kissing people is definitely a posh thing.” A medical researcher confessed: “I’m northern, this never comes up, apart from when I’m down south, and then I just do as instructed.”A woman in her 30s had had enough. “Just the one. And say clearly, ‘I just do the one.’”What to take from all this? For a while, after I’d listened to and digested all these anxieties and opinions, my methods of introduction became a little wild – erratic. Over a week of nursery drop-offs, I cycled through some alternative greeting methods, trialling one person’s suggestion of “a general wave” and then another, “the footballers’ handclutch”. Neither felt right. I drifted back to the arm squeeze: forearms only, to be safe.In other parts of life I tried to take on the more sensible-sounding advice: bending down to address children medium-squeezing offered hands double-kissing posh southerners and trying to read prompts from everyone else, before kissing them. Actually, wiser respondents had advised something like this in all scenarios. Make eye contact and smile as you greet people at that point, if in doubt, be led by them.More than anything, I kept thinking about a retiree I spoke to. She was about to turn 80 and had put a lot of thought and worry into all of this stuff over the years. How stupid it all seemed to her now. “We spend so much time and effort showing each other we like each other. It’s wasted,” she said. If she could instigate a new rule, whenever people met, “We’d all just… nod.”• Commenting on this piece?

A wretched season in which they have conceded more points and tries than any other club in the Premiership, fortunate to avoid more than a passing flirtation with relegation, contains a sliver of silver after pushing the Tigers out of the play-off places.The Saints led 17-12 at the end of a first half that lasted 57 minutes. Most of the stoppage time was taken up for treatment to the Northampton captain Rob Horne, who got his body position wrong trying to tackle Graham Kitchener from the kick-off and suffered a blow to the head. He was strapped on to a stretcher and taken to an ambulance.Northampton took a while to recover from the blow and should have been behind when they did. Telusa Veainu knocked on 10 metres out after Sam Harrison had split the defence, Matt Toomua twice caught Horne’s replacement Luther Burrell rushing up too early and made clean breaks and the chance of a driving maul in Northampton’s 22 was wrecked when Tom Youngs, not for the last time, threw the ball over the lineout.A try duly came, but it was scored by Northampton. Paul Hill galloped away from a ruck after spotting Valentino Mapapalangi defending too wide and eight phases later Ben Foden crossed on the left wing. Leicester were beset by sloppiness, as if seduced by Northampton’s poor record, and after Sam Harrison was turned over by his namesake Teimana, Stephen Myler’s penalty took the Saints into double figures.Leicester sobered up. Veainu held on to the ball after Ellis Genge’s tackle breaking run and Matt Toomua gave the Tigers the lead after Kitchener charged down Cobus Reinach’s clearance. The second row appeared to knock the ball on, but the try was awarded after a lengthy review. It was a decision to drain the morale of a struggling side, but within two minutes Northampton were ahead again after Mapapalangi again drifted into a position where was covering neither the ball-carrier nor a potential receiver.A Kitchener foul off the ball gave Northampton a lineout on Leicester’s 22. Harrison caught the ball at the back and passed inside to Reinach who had a straight run to the line for a ludicrously simple try against a team with title pretensions.Leicester were no more switched on at the start of the second half, Ahsee Tuala extending Northampton’s lead, and when the Tigers had a scrum five metres from the Saints’ line only to be penalised as the replacement prop Alex Waller announced himself, the home side were in desperate need of a redeemer.Ben Youngs came on 25 minutes from the end, for the first time since suffering a knee injury during England’s opening Six Nations match in Rome. He passed his brother Tom on his way on, but changing the hooker did not cure Leicester’s lineout malady: Northampton conceded eight penalties in the third quarter, but they stole two lineout and the comeback started with two George Ford penalties.Northampton’s persistent infringing led to Waller receiving a yellow card after 63 minutes but Leicester remained mired in mediocrity. They conceded another penalty from a scrum, which Myler turned into three points. Ford reduced the arrears to six points with his third penalty before the replacement centre George Worth summed up his side’s afternoon when, 10 metres from Northampton’s line with a two-man overlap, he threw the ball behind Luke Hamilton.Leicester did cross the line five minutes from time through Jonah Holmes, but only because George Worth had cleared his path through a block. They did not threaten again, turned over yet again one minute from time, looking no more like champions than their opponents."},{"url":null,"title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceWon the Irish Grand National in 2015, beating Rule The World at level weights, form which looked pretty good when the runner-up won the next year’s Grand National. Has not won since and yet somehow remains 6lb higher than for his Fairyhouse success. Was not to blame for his jockey being knocked out of the saddle in this last year but harder to make excuses for his falls in his last two races, since he got about halfway up the fence on each occasion and was under no great pressure at the time. The ability is probably still in there somewhere.Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Has been useful and consistent around the northern tracks this winter but it’s hard to believe he has the class for this and his stamina seems to have been exposed by weak finishing efforts in his last two starts.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ab55a2eec0455c6b522582b220a89d0f4c899d/87_41_2846_1992/master/2846.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d7d8afb73d7606b8fc3401692e1522 5500w","title":"the unseen red rum in pictures","story":"After Red Rum’s second Grand National victory in 1974, Jeremy Hoare was invited by trainer Ginger McCain to meet and photograph the legendary racehorse at his Southport Yard.

There’s still (just about) time to take in Chris Cook’s video preview:I was managing a bookies in Harlesden the day of the National that never was.While you’re here, why not sign up for The Recap, our weekly email roundup of the best of our coverage? It takes less time than an ill-advised each-way bet:There are three female jockeys lining up at the start line – Katie Walsh on Baie Des Iles, Bryony Frost on Milansbar, and Rachael Blackmore on Alpha Des Obeaux. Chris Cook had a chat with all three ahead of the race:Three horses have emerged from the scrum at the head of the betting, with Total Recall set to go off favourite at eight or nine to one. Here’s Chris Cook’s view on that quartet:Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.“My 88 year old Dad has chosen Chase The Spud,” says Helen. “He was called Spud at school – his name went from Taylor to tater to potato to spud! I thought I had heard every one of his stories, but this was new one to me.” Lovely stuff.Chris Corrigan of our esteemed racing desk has some background on a couple of the 20-1 shots. 13-year-old Raz De Maree would be the oldest winner since Sergeant Murphy back in 1923. He has a chance, having won the Welsh Grand National in January.Then there’s Captain Redbeard, trained near Selkirk by Stuart Coltherd and ridden by his son Sam.

Ryanair sponsored that race, so he’ll get his money back. Good for him. Flanagan rides Road To Riches in the National, which has gone from 80-1 to 33-1 in the last couple of days.Identity Thief and Wholestone break away from Sam Spinner, whose chances are ended by another mistake at the last.

Saint Are is 50-1 but that might come in as fans of narrative reach the bookies. Anyway – it’s time for the 4.20pm race, the last before the big one...Richard Johnson, the champion jockey, will get an unexpected chance to win the National for the first time in his long career aboard Saint Are, who has finished second and third in this race in the past. He replaces the luckless Adrian Heskin, who has been taken to hospital for X-rays on his wrist after a fall from Rocklander in the Betway Handicap Chase. There is now just an hour to go until the Grand National itself and there are still at least four horses that could set off as the favourite. In fact, this could well be the most open National this century, and the biggest price for a favourite since 2000 has been 10-1, in 2014, 2010 and 2004.The shortest-priced favourite in that time, incidentally, was Seabass, who set off at just 11-2 in 2013 after a widespread public gamble on the possibility that Katie Walsh would become the first female rider to win the race.She finished 13th behind the 66-1 chance Aurora’s Encore, and Hedgehunter, who was a 7-1 chance in 2005, remains the only clear favourite to win the race this century, although Don’t Push It (10-1 in 2010) and Comply Or Die (7-1 in 2008) were both joint favourites.Total Recall seems most likely to emerge as a clear favourite at this stage, but if the market leader (or leaders) were to set off at 12-1 or bigger, this would be not just one of the most open races of the century, but one of the most open of all time.Some breaking news – Adrian Heskin has been stood down after falling on Rocklander in the last race, and will not ride Saint Are in the final race. In the Stayers Hurdle, Paddy Brennan will ride The Worlds End. No word on Heskin’s replacement in the big race, but Noel Fehily and Richard Johnson are possibilities.Aintree’s Stayers Hurdle is the last of our ‘appetiser’ races before the Grand National itself. It’s a redemption mission for Sam Spinner, who was well fancied for the equivalent race at the Cheltenham Festival last month but ended up setting too slow a pace in front and getting outpaced. A Grade One winner at Ascot in December, he could easily bounce back and is one of the hottest favourites of the day at 6-5. Still, I prefer the claims of Wholestone, who ended up about a length in front of that rival at Cheltenham, where he was third and best of the English-trained horses. He’s tough, consistent and not at all bothered by this kind of ground. Then there’s The Worlds End, who won a Grade One over this course and distance last April, and Identity Thief, trying a new distance after running a respectable fourth in the Champion Hurdle.ITV are taking a look back at the infamous ‘race that never was’ in 1993, some 25 (!) years ago. I can still remember, as a sport-mad 10-year-old, being told by a family friend that the race had been abandoned. I was convinced he was having me on until I got home and saw the highlights. What an extraordinary farce.Thanks Tony. Good afternoon, everyone! The National appears to have fallen on the first day of spring. That means sun-kissed stands and throngs of people drinking far too much fruit-based cider, but heavy going on the track that could turn the race into a slog. The betting remains wide open, with 16 horses sandwiched between odds of 11-1 and 25-1.And with that, as we cross the Melling Road, I hand over to my colleague Niall McVeigh.

The judge rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. Warby ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing about the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living from commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”A spokesperson for Carter-Ruck, which acts for both NT1 and NT2 in their case against Google said that it has several other clients with ongoing de-listing and take-down complaints.“The decision should cause Google to put in place improved reviewing processes of de-listing requests,” he said.He added that the case should also cause Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office to reassess its own approach to a review of de-listing requests."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

As guest host, Paxman isn’t the first man to talk down to a female panellist on the show – this time, delivering supercilious praise when McGovern answered a question correctly – and, as long as it lumbers on, he won’t be the last.Now into its 55th series, HIGNFY squats in the schedules like a smug toad, resolute in its if-it-ain’t-broke-don’t-fix-it folly. A festival of schoolboy sniggering, watching it is much like crashing a college reunion that’s gearing up for a rose-tinted game of soggy biscuit. One wonders if Will Self, in describing the show as “the very cockpit of British satire”, wasn’t being so flattering after all. While there are odd glimpses of the old humour, the mood is frequently toxic, with captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton piling in on guests and then scratching their heads when producers struggle to find fresh ones.The most recent upset came when Hislop and Merton were quizzed in the Radio Times about the absence of female guest hosts, specifically women MPs, to which they replied, “Everyone you think should have been asked has been.” The real problem, they decided, is that women are too modest to come on their show. You what, lads? If modesty is how you interpret a woman weighing up her options and deciding she’d rather feast on fire ants in the Australian jungle than endure your special brand of humiliation then perhaps that says more about you than them?Editors could construct a sports-style montage out of the times that Hislop, Merton and male guests have talked over, patronised and bullied female panellists. For some choice lowlights, let me point you to the time Jimmy Carr jeered at Ann Widdecombe, “Ooh, take off your glasses, you’re beautiful”, or when Hislop and Merton interrogated Paula Yates about her breasts and choice of boyfriend. Their modest women theory is particularly precious when you consider the debate surrounding the gender pay gap and the claim made by an economist on a recent Today programme that men are paid more because of “choices freely made”. Apparently structural barriers are a figment of the female imagination, a consequence of all those hormones pulsing through our systems and paralysing our ability to see our own lack of ambition.But back to HIGNFY and the search for the lesser-spotted female MP, which is now, by all accounts, rivalling the hunt for the yeti. Tip-off, chaps: Anna Soubry has said she’s game. But even the presence of more women – more, at least, than one per episode – won’t save this sinking vessel. Last week, Merton, who has napped through the show for at least a decade, did little more than the odd cartoon double take, and left Hislop’s pompous proclamations unpunctured. Meanwhile, Paxman bellowed pointlessly and Josh Widdicombe barely uttered a word. Rarely has a show appeared more tired, more flabby, more blunted by its own complacency. The time has come to put it out of its misery. To go quietly would surely be the modest thing to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures. Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities. With so many options for fun in the sun, we take a look at some of the best.A full beach experience right on the Strip. Body surf in the wave pool, relax on a day bed, or take a gentle float down the lazy river. There are cabanas for all temperaments, whether you want seclusion or want to party. To really get away from the crowds, hire a cabana or gazebo with private pool and lounge area. The beach is family friendly, but head to the nearby Toptional Moorea club for a more grown-up experience.Mandalay Bay, 3950 S.

Las Vegas Blvd.Pick a pool. Caesars Palace has seven to choose from, each with its own theme. They all feature cabanas and day beds, so be guided by your mood. The Apollo pool receives the most sunlight, while the Jupiter is more secluded. Gamers will like the Fortuna, which has a swim-up blackjack table, while those looking for a European vibe should head for the Venus pool lounge.

Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E.

It’s known for its hiking trails (there are 26 numbered hikes), which cater for all levels of fitness and reach from canyon floors to the highest points. A 13-mile paved road provides a scenic drive through stunning desert landscapes other activities include mountain biking, horseback riding and target shooting — it’s also a wonderful spot for stargazing.This luxurious but relaxed resort, away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, has two pools. The M Pool is the family-friendly version it has plenty of seating and cabanas for hire, and there are two large hot tubs on the pool deck.

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the US-led strikes on Syria a “military crime”. According to state news agency IRNA, Khamenei spoke at a meeting with Iranian officials and ambassadors from some Islamic countries.“The attack this morning against Syria is a crime,” Khamenei added later on his Telegram channel. “The American president, the French president and the British prime minister are criminals, they will gain nothing from it.”Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said the allied strikes in Syria were a “necessary and appropriate” response to what the US and its allies say was a recent chemical attack in the Syrian city of Douma.Merkel said Berlin viewed the US, UK and France had taken “responsibility in this way as permanent members of the UN security council ... to maintain the effectiveness of the international rejection of chemical weapons use and to warn the Syrian regime against further violations”.In a response to questions about the strikes, China’s foreign ministry called any military action that bypasses the UN security council a violation of international law. “We consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement.“China believes that a political solution is the only realistic way out for the Syrian issue,” she added. “China urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.”The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said those who rely on chemical warfare must be held to account by the world.Juncker said the suspected use of poison gas last week in the Syrian city of Douma was as he puts it a “heinous chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime”. He said the world “has the responsibility to identify and hold accountable those responsible” for the attack.The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who this week ruled out his country’s participation in military action in Syria, announced his unequivocal support for the targeted bombings.“Canada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime’s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people,” he said. Trudeau added that Canada would continue to investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria and that those responsible for the recent attacks “must be brought to justice”.Israel, which was recently accused by Iran of carrying out its own airstrikes on military bases in Syria, was among the first to praise the strikes. “Last year, President Trump made clear that the use of chemical weapons crosses a red line. Tonight, under American leadership, the United States, France and the United Kingdom enforced that line.”The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the actions by the US, France and UK coalition should be supported because they would “reduce the government’s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons”.“Nato has consistently condemned Syria’s continued use of chemical weapons as a clear breach of international norms and agreements,” he said. “The use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable.”Turkey’s foreign ministry said it welcomed the strikes as an “appropriate response”.Ankara said chemical weapons attacks that indiscriminately target civilians “constitute crimes against humanity” and should not go unpunished.UN secretary- general, António Guterres, said that while use of chemical weapons was “abhorrent” and “horrendous”, he urged caution in retaliating, expressing concern that any escalation of the violence would only increase the suffering of those living in Syria.“I urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,” Guterres said in a statement. The strikes carried out by the US, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said, calling the raids “a very dangerous development”. “Such action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,” it said.

Dean is fluent in Irish and attends Gaelscoil an Bhradain Feasa, near their home in Drogheda, Co Louth.Thousands of people are attending an Irish language street festival in Dublin city centre on Saturday, coming from all over the country for the ‘Beo’ (Alive) event. The festival took place in Merrion Square, and featured entertainment, music and speeches, with President Michael D Higgins addressing the crowd. Dean Afolabi, who turns 11 years old tomorrow, was one young man attending the festival. His mother Tomi Matuluko, who came to Ireland from Nigeria 15 years ago, accompanied him on Saturday. Dean is fluent in Irish and attends Gaelscoil an Bhradain Feasa, near their home in Drogheda, Co Louth. He said there was “no difference” to learning Irish and English, and he enjoyed his school. His mother Tomi said the pair travelled to the Beo event, because “we are proud to be Irish citizens”. “My son here speaks Irish, he goes to Irish school, we have to celebrate our heritage, so that’s why we are here. We are here to show we have integrated and we are proud to be Irish,” she said.Language groups, schools, sports clubs, third level societies, community groups and Gaeltacht groups took part in the street festival, one of the main events of Bliain na Gaeilge 2018.Buses travelled from 15 locations around the country to the event which started at Parnell Square at 1pm. A rally proceeded down O’Connell Street at 2pm to Merrion Square, where the festival took place.“I suppose what Beo is all about today is to show the vitality and vibrancy of the language. What we’re showing is despite 125 years of revival that there’s still challenges out there, and we do face many, especially in Gaeltacht areas.“The public in general have a huge interest in the language, and they’re always looking for more opportunities to use it. So today is an opportunity to come together. It’s a chance to celebrate and realise the language is so integral to who we are as a country,” he said. Sarah Scannell was another Irish language enthusiast who attended the festival. Living in Dublin, she has a young son in a Gaelscoil. “We came out as a family, there’s three generations of us here today. We make an effort every day to speak it,” she said. The festival was an opportunity to bring people interested in the language together, which was important, “especially when you’re trying to pass it on to the younger children,” she said.The growth in popularity of Gaelscoileanna was “great” she said, but added it was important to make sure they were open to children of immigrant families as well. “The schools are doing a great job to try and make it more accessible to people that are coming into Ireland” she said. Bliain na Gaeilge 2018 is a year-long celebration of the Irish language organised around five key themes - the revival of the language over the last 125 years the creativity of the language the vibrancy of the language community participation and the value of Gaeltacht areas.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Syria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest newsEvidence shows Syria \u0026#39attacked own people with chemical weapons\u0026#39, say US, UK and FranceComment: In the name of the children of Douma, we must punish those who murder with gasFrench court rejects plea from luxury wine label to stop cheap blends being sold under \u0026#39Petrus\u0026#39 nameBritish murder suspect named as one of Europe\u0026#39s most wanted men after London knife attackComment: It\u0026#39s not enough to just lob missiles into Syria.

The Government should do whatever possible to push Russia and the United States to agree to an independent UN-led investigation of last weekend\u0027s horrific chemical weapons attack so that those responsible can be held to account.\u0026quotThe leader of the opposition was visiting to Huddersfield on Saturday and spoke to his Conservative counterpart late on Friday. He said: \u0026quotI had a late night conversation with the Prime Minister and my whole point is that Parliament should be consulted, parliament should be allowed to take a view on this but, instead, the strikes were launched last night.\u0026quotParliament is in session on Monday. She could have come to Parliament on Monday to discuss the whole situation. Instead, they\u0027ve launched these strikes.\u0026quotShe claims there\u0027s a legal basis for it.\u0026quotI\u0027ve asked her in a letter I\u0027ve just to sent her this morning to publish in full the legal basis and justification for it.\u0026quotDuring the Yorkshire visit, Mr Corbyn added: \u0026quotAlso, why she hasn\u0027t heeded the words of Antonio Guterres - the general secretary of the United Nations - who wanted the strikes to be stopped, who wanted the UN charter to be observed, and give time for the OPCW to do its inspection of chemical weapons in Syria?\u0026quotAnd, also, to work again to get a ceasefire in Syria so that no more people are killed in this ghastly civil war in Syria.\u0026quotHe said: \u0026quotWe\u0027ll be pushing for publication of the legal advice that the government has given.\u0026quotWe will be demanding that the government goes back to the United Nations with the support of the Swedish government, or in support of the Swedish government in order the get a new UN resolution and bring Russia and the United States together along with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey - all the neighbouring states there. This civil war is ghastly. It\u0027s killed hundreds of thousands.\u0026quotIt\u0027s driven millions into refuge in other countries and the chemical weapons are obviously appalling and disgusting and completely illegal within international law.\u0026quotMr Corbyn said there was only a legal basis for action if there was a direct threat to the UK.He said: \u0026quotYou could only do it under the basis of self-defence - if there was a direct threat to us, and there wasn\u0027t.\u0026quotIntervention in Syria | Read moreStewart McDonald, the Scottish National Party spokesman for defence, said UK forces had been engaged in \u0026quotgesture bombing with no major international consensus\u0026quot.\u0026quotMost worrying is that she has acted at the behest of presidential tweets and sidelined Parliament,\u0026quot he said on Twitter.\u0026quotWhat does this new bombing campaign do to help move Syria towards peace? Nothing.\u0026quotInstead, it has the potential to dangerously complicate the war, making matters on the ground worse for the people that the strikes are supposed to help. There is no peace strategy.\u0026quotOwen Smith, the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, also attacked the decision, writing on Twitter: \u0026quotThe House of Commons is elected to represent the people of our country and to hold our Executive to account.\u0026quotParliament should have been recalled and consulted before we engaged in this military action in Syria.\u0026quotBut Carwyn Jones, Labour\u0027s First Minister of Wales, backed the action, as long as it was part of a wider plan to bring peace to the region.Mr Jones said: \u0026quotI spoke with the PM late last night about the action in Syria. I offered my support to any intervention that could prevent a further atrocity, but it is vital that any action forms part of a wider long-term plan for the region.\u0026quotI have urged the Prime Minister to do all she can to avoid civilian casualties given the complicated picture on the ground in Syria, and she has given me assurances in that regard.\u0026quotOur thoughts today are with our service personnel and the people of Syria, who have endured beyond all measure.\u0026quotAt a Pentagon briefing shortly after President Trump announced strikes had taken place, Gen Joseph Dunford said a scientific research facility in Damascus, allegedly connected to the production of chemical and biological weapons, had been hit, along with a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs and a chemical weapons equipment storage site and command post, also near Homs.Syrian state television said government forces had shot down more than a dozen missiles, and claimed only the research facility in Damascus had been damaged.

I clearly declare that the president of the United States, the president of France and the British prime minister are criminals,\u0026quot Khamenei said in a speech, according to his Twitter account.\u0026quotThey will not benefit (from the attack) as they went to Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan in the past years and committed such crimes and did not gain any benefits,\u0026quot Khamenei said.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei poses for a portraitIran - the dominant Shi’ite Muslim power which is in rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the United States’ other Sunni Arab friends - has fought decades of sectarian proxy wars in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.Iran\u0027s pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani also warned that the U.S.-led missile attack on Syria would lead to further destruction in the Middle East, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\u0026quotSuch attacks will have no result but more destruction ... the Americans want to justify their presence in the region by such attacks,\u0026quot Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim.Rouhani signalled that Iran\u0027s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would grow.\u0026quotThe Syrian nation will continue to resist against foreign aggression ...Iran has always helped and will continue to support oppressed nations in the region and around the globe,\u0026quot Rouhani said.Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan said: \u0026quotThe Syrian people will certainly answer these attacks and the people of the world should condemn this aggression,\u0026quot Fars news agency reported.An official in Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the Islamic Republic\u0027s most powerful arm, said the fallout from the attacks will be at Washington\u0027s expense.Britain, the US and France on Friday night bombed Syria. Pictured is an RAF Tornado GR4 landing at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be deployed against the Syrian government\u0026quotWith this attack ... the situation will become more complex, and this will surely be at the expense of the United States, which will be responsible for the aftermath of upcoming regional events that will certainly not be in their interest,\u0026quot Yadollah Javani, the Guards\u0027 deputy head for political affairs, told Fars news agency.\u0026quotThe resistance front will be strengthened and it will have more capacity to act against (U.S.) acts of intervention. Americans should expect the consequences of their actions,\u0026quot Javani said.Iran often refers to regional countries and forces opposed to Israel and the United States as a \u0026quotresistance front\u0026quot.\u0026quotUndoubtedly, the United States and its allies, which took military action against Syria despite the absence of any proven evidence ... will assume responsibility for the regional and trans-regional consequences of this adventurism,\u0026quot Iran\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by state media.\u0026quotIran is opposed to the use of chemical weapons on the basis of religious, legal and ethical standards, while at the same time it ... strongly condemns (using this) as an excuse to commit aggression against a sovereign state,\u0026quot it said.Iran has been Assad\u0027s most supportive ally against insurgents throughout the conflict. Iran-backed militias helped his army stem rebel advances and, following Russia’s entry into the war in 2015, turn the tide decisively in Assad’s favour.Analyst Hossein Sheikholeslam, a former Iranian ambassador to Damascus, told state television the attacks would help unite Syrians behind the government.\u0026quotThese attacks will stabilise the Syrian government... and unite the different tribes in Syria as Syrians become aware of their honour and come to the defence of the independence, territorial integrity and the government of their country,\u0026quot Sheikholeslam said.Israel said in response to the American-led strike in Syria that the Middle Eastern country\u0027s \u0026quotmurderous actions\u0026quot had put it in danger.An official said in a statement that Mr Trump made clear last year that the use of chemical weapons was a red line not to be crossed.Damascus sky lights up with service to air missile fire as the U.S. launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, Syria, early Saturday, April 14, 2018He said the overnight operation carried out by the United States, France and Britain followed that example. The official said that \u0026quotSyria continues to carry out murderous actions and be a base for these actions and others, including Iran\u0027s, that put its territory, forces and leadership in peril.\u0026quotThe official spoke anonymously according to protocol. There has been no other official Israeli response yet.Israel has issued several stern warnings of late about Iran\u0027s increased involvement along its border in Syria in Lebanon.Air strikes carried out by the United States, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said on Saturday.The air strikes marked a \u0026quota very dangerous development\u0026quot, the ministry said in statement.\u0026quotSuch action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,\u0026quot it said.The ministry called on Arab leaders to discuss the situation at a summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.Saudi Arabia has expressed its full support for US-led strikes on Syrian government military installations, saying they were a response to \u0026quotregime crimes\u0026quot against civilians.\u0026quotSaudi Arabia fully supports the strikes launched by the United States, France and Britain against Syria because they represent a response to the regime\u0027s crimes,\u0026quot a foreign ministry statement said.Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud meets with U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump during a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 20, 2017The statement, carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said the strikes were prompted by the \u0026quotSyrian regime\u0027s use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians, including women and children\u0026quot.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have been key backers of Syrian opposition groups fighting Assad.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed Western strikes against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime as \u0026quotappropriate\u0026quot in retaliation for Damascus\u0027 \u0026quotinhumane\u0026quot attacks.\u0026quotWe consider this operation as appropriate,\u0026quot Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling party in Istanbul.\u0026quotThe regime has seen that its mounting attacks in recent days against dissidents ... will not be left unanswered.\u0026quotChina said it was \u0026quotopposed to the use of force\u0026quot following US-led air strikes against Syria and called for a \u0026quotreturn to the framework of international law\u0026quot.\u0026quotWe consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries,\u0026quot foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on its website.Hua said unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council would \u0026quotadd new complicating factors to the resolution of the Syrian issue\u0026quot.Xi Jinping and Donald Trump\u0026quotChina believes that a political solution is the only realistic way out for the Syrian issue,\u0026quot she added.\u0026quotChina urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.\u0026quotChina is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.Beijing has consistently said the Syrian crisis needs a \u0026quotpolitical solution\u0026quot but has numerous times vetoed Security Council measures aimed at addressing the conflict - including an investigation of war crimes in the country.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday the air strikes against the Syrian regime were \u0026quotnecessary and appropriate\u0026quot after the suspected chemical weapons attacks that killed dozens in Douma.\u0026quotWe support the fact that our US, British and French allies ... assumed their responsibilities. The military intervention was necessary and appropriate,\u0026quot Merkel said in a statement.\u0026quotEverything leads us to believe that (Assad) bears responsibility\u0026quot for the Douma attack, Merkel said.The chancellor on Thursday had ruled out Germany joining any military action against Syria.On Saturday she said it appeared likely that the Syrian regime \u0026quothad used chemical weapons against its own people on several occasions in the past\u0026quot.Merkel added: \u0026quotA century after the end of World War I... we must fight against the erosion of the (international) convention on chemical weapons\u0026quot.\u0026quotGermany will undertake, in a determined way, diplomatic efforts to support this,\u0026quot Merkel said.The head of Nato expressed his support for Western strikes in Syria.Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u0026quotI support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotThis will reduce the regime\u0027s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons.\u0026quotUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday called for restraint and for countries to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation in Syria after the United States, France and Britain carried out strikes.Guterres delayed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to deal with the aftermath of the military action.\u0026quotI urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u0026quot Guterres said in a statement.\u0026quotAny use of chemical weapons is abhorrent. The suffering it causes is horrendous,\u0026quot Guterres said.The UN chief said it was important to act in line with the UN charter and international law.He urged the UN Security Council to agree on establishing an inquiry that would identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks.European Council president Donald Tusk said the European Union would stand with its allies \u0026quoton the side of justice\u0026quot.\u0026quotStrikes by US, France and UK make it clear that Syrian regime together with Russia \u0026amp Iran cannot continue this human tragedy, at least not without cost,\u0026quot he wrote on Twitter.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU commission, said the use of chemical weapons was \u0026quotunacceptable in any circumstances\u0026quot:Boris Johnson will meet with European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday at a meeting to dominated by the strikes on Syria, James Crisp reports from Brussels. Through the weekend, British diplomats and ministers will be in touch with their EU counterparts to lay the groundwork for discussion over Friday night\u0027s air strikes. EU Ministers are expected to back language condemning the use of chemical weapons in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council. Before the joint US-UK and French attack, London and Paris was pushing to toughen up the language of the draft joint statement, which will decry the use of chemical weapons and the greying of the international line against their use. Those efforts are continuing. The debate among ministers will include discussion over the strike but also how to prevent the use of chemical weapons in the future and secure a ceasefire in Syria. Mr Johnson can expect support from other EU member states such as Belgium and the Netherlands. The meeting was always going to be important for Britain as it is the first Foreign Affairs Council after Theresa May secured EU support for condemning Russia for the Salisbury attack.The Telegraph understands the conclusions will take a tougher line on Russia and Iran than the statement agreed by EU leaders on March 21. This will not include sanctions at this stage but there is likely to be language stating that option remains on the table. Indonesia expressed concern over the airstrikes while strongly condemning the use of chemical weapons that caused the loss of many innocent lives, Nicola Smith reports.“Indonesia is concerned about unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in response to the chemical weapons attack tragedy in Syria,” foreign ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said.Jakarta argued that taking military actions without prior authorisation from the UN Security Council was not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes.The country further requests the UN Security Council take immediate steps to resolve the crisis in Syria, reported the Jakarta Post.“For Indonesia, peace and stability in Syria can only be achieved through dialogue and an inclusive political process,” said Mr Arrmanatha.Meanwhile, the Philippine foreign ministry advised all its citizens in Syria to remain in their homes until further notice, said spokesman Elmer Cato.Cato said the Philippine charge d’affaires in Syria, Crescente Relacion, had “described the more or less one hour missile barrage” as “like New Year in Manila.”Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has ruled out Canadian participation in the strikes but said that Canada supports the decision by its allies in the US, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotCanada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u0027s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria,\u0026quot said Mr Trudeau, in a statement issued from Lima, Peru, where he is attending the Summit of the Americas.\u0026quotCanada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u0027s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.\u0026quotWe will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u0026quotEarlier on Friday, Canada became the latest country to lay the blame for a deadly chemical-weapons attack in Syria last week at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s doorstep, despite Russian suggestions to the contrary.\u0026quotWhen it comes to this use of chemical weapons, it is clear to Canada that chemical weapons were used and that they were used by the Assad regime,\u0026quot said Chrystia Freeland, Canadian foreign minister.Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the attacks on Damascus and Homs, but issued a statement lending its support to the coalition’s actions.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, said in a statement jointly issued with the foreign and defence ministers: “The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible.“The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity.”Mr Turnbull said the strikes were “a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response”.“They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.”Please review our commenting policySyria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest newsEvidence shows Syria \u0026#39attacked own people with chemical weapons\u0026#39, say US, UK and FranceComment: In the name of the children of Douma, we must punish those who murder with gasFrench court rejects plea from luxury wine label to stop cheap blends being sold under \u0026#39Petrus\u0026#39 nameBritish murder suspect named as one of Europe\u0026#39s most wanted men after London knife attackComment: It\u0026#39s not enough to just lob missiles into Syria.

Fourteen days of strikes have already hit 65 universities since 22 February.But members of the UCU voted to call off more action after bosses at Universities UK agreed a joint panel would be set up to reassess the pension issue.The news was welcomed by the National Union of Students (NUS), with estimates suggesting up to 1 million students were affected by previous walkouts.Shakira Martin, NUS president, said: “We are pleased to see a deal has been reached.

Universities UK had said the alterations would help make up a £6bn deficit.But, with the proposals now dropped, members of the UCU voted almost two to one to stop more walkouts and instead reopen negotiations. There was a record 63.5 per cent turn out, the union said.Sally Hunt, UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.”And she added: “We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.“UCU has more work to do to ensure that the agreement delivers the security in retirement that university staff deserve.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I’d believed one thing all\u0026nbspmy life and all of a sudden it was a lie’A woman from Carlisle has been told she is not British, despite being born in the UK and living in the country all her life.Irene Kaali, 24, who was born in Bradford and now works in local government, had her application for British citizenship “failed” because her parents did not have indefinite leave to remain at the time of her birth. Her parents moved to the UK from Tanzania shortly before she was born. They now both have settled status, with her mother working as a nurse and her father as a lecturer.Number of Britons getting EU citizenship doublesBritish-born man receives Home Office letter ordering him to leave UKBritish citizenship for children 22 times more expensive than GermanyBut despite this, and despite the fact that Ms Kaari has grown up, studied and worked in Britain, the Home Office informed her she had “no automatic claim” to British citizenship, and that if she wanted to apply, she would have to pay £1,163 plus an admin fee of £80. A response to her request for a passport stated the application had been “failed” because in order to have a claim to British citizenship, “one of her parents would need to have been settled or British at the time of her birth”.It went on to state that although she has no “automatic claim” to British citizenship, “from the information provided it appears she may have a right to register as a British citizen under section 1(4) of the BNA 1981”.Undocumented mother pledges to stay in New York City church until she earns reprieve from deportationMs Kaali told The Independent: “This was very confusing. I was born here, so I just assumed that I was British. I felt disheartened and confused about who I was. I’d believed one thing for my whole life and all of a sudden it was a lie.”Out of frustration, Ms Kaali posted a status on Facebook about what had happened. She received a flurry of responses from people saying they were shocked and surprised.“They didn’t know this was a thing that happened they always knew me as being British,” she said.Friends persuaded her to create a GoFundMe petition to raise funds for her citizenship application, and within the first 20 hours she had raised half the money needed. She has now reached the target.British-born man receives Home Office letter ordering him to leave UK“It’s incredible and I’m so thankful, but for me it doesn’t really end there. There is an issue in terms of what they class someone as British is – it’s very vague. It’s a case of your parents’ status, and there are a lot of boxes you need to tick to apply,” she said.“It says you have to have lived here up until you were 10 years old, you have to have not left the country for more than five years, and the last one is you have to be of ‘good character’. “It almost feels like that’s a sneakily vague thing they put in there so they can decide at their own discretion who they deem to be British or not.”Ms Kaali now hopes to launch a petition to change the rules around applying for British citizenship, and is in the process of speaking to lawyers and other experts to propose a viable alternative.She added: “I don’t feel like it’s enough to just stop here knowing that so many people are in a similar situation. Not only do you have to meet that criteria but you have to pay the ridiculous funds as well. Not every has access to those kind of funds.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May gives a press conference at Downing Street following British military action, alongside US and France, against Syria.

He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
