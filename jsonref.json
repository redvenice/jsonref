It rained the entire day long. It was cold, it was miserable, it was wet.\u0027The young Prince had to dress up in a kilt, black jacket and white lace jabot for the Royal Family procession into Westminster Abbey.          Pictured: Michael Crawford at 11Actor Michael Crawford was an 11-year-old schoolboy when he watched the occasion with his family in The Mall. He tells the programme: ‘This brought our country together – it’s very stirring, moving and brings out great pride.’Looking at his scrapbook from the time about the Coronation he admits: ‘It was a passion. Everything I could find in the newspapers I cut out.’Crawford, above, who went on to find fame on television and stage, says: ‘You see thousands of soldiers and it’s the pageantry, the uniforms, the regalia… There was this extraordinary spectacle.’                                                    Watching film commissioned by the Queen to record the atmosphere inside Buckingham Palace on the day, he says: \u0027Imagine the build-up and the excitement. A great deal of hustle and bustle and fiddling around making sure things were put on the right way round. I remember how glamorous the Queen looked, this radiant figure.\u0027In one sequence, a line of carriages in the Palace courtyard prepare to transport members of the Royal Family and VIPs including Winston Churchill to the Abbey.The Prince recalls the journey in a carriage with his mother, Princess Marina, his sister, Princess Alexandra, and brother, the Duke of Kent. \u0027There was an enormous crowd and they had periscopes, a lot of them, which were strange-looking devices where you looked through a viewer, and it then went up and you could look over the heads of the people in front of you… \u0027So you had a forest of these strange-looking things which were sticking out from the crowd.\u0027The sight of the Queen\u0027s four-ton Gold State Coach with eight grey horses also transfixed him.\u0027I don\u0027t think there are very often occasions where eight greys pull a coach. You have to have as many as that because the Coronation coach weighs so much.\u0027The Prince, 75, adds: \u0027It was a wonderful occasion and it\u0027s amazing to think we are here all these years later.\u0027The Queen\u0027s Coronation In Colour is on ITV tomorrow at 9pm.

Jeppesen said he found North Korean people to be friendly, pictured above with two friends in 2016          In his book he reveals how he lived in a lavish but empty hotel, was escorted by two mandatory guides in public at all times, and was woken up every morning to a 5am ode to Kim II-sung          He adds that the hardest part of the trip was the psychological toll of being constantly watched and monitored as he studied in the nation\u0027s capitol, railway station in Pyongyang above          He describes everyday life where men and women wear colorful clothing, head to the zoo for fun, and are under the constant watchful eye of their official housing unit spy, view of Pyongyang aboveBut that doesn\u0027t mean there aren\u0027t loopholes. Relaxed inminbanjangs would turn a blind eye to certain rules such as one woman Jeppesen met who was \u0027known to rent out her second room as an hourly love hotel for extra income.\u0027Contrary to the mental picture of uniformed citizens and regimented society many might have of North Korea, Jeppesen says times are changing and fashion has become more relaxed. Men were seen wearing short-sleeve shirts of all colors and designs as well as flashy Rolexes on their wrists, though they\u0027re often fake ones.Women wore skirts and occasionally jeans were permitted for certain positions.A hot trend for the ladies was high heels sported with socks.   One of the more bizarre sights for the student was seeing North Korean citizens visit the zoo which boasts more than 6,000 animals and 650 species and mostly displayed dogs and cats.\u0027Having pets was never really part of the culture. North Korea has always been a very poor country, and they’ve always had difficulty feeding their citizens. Keeping an animal you have to feed when you yourself aren\u0027t getting enough rice to get you through the day is an outrageous luxury to them,\u0027 Jeppesen said. It was at the zoo he was stunned to find an elderly woman selling ice cream and candy be violently taken away by two police officers. \u0027I subtly tried to watch where they were taking her, but I lost sight of them...I don’t think it ended well for her,\u0027 he wrote in his book.  As for home entertainment, Jeppensen said the evening news was a monotone review of Kim Jonh-un’s daily schedule recited as \u0027cheery symphonic music\u0027 played in the background.While watching TV at a government official’s home, Jeppesen said the officer turned off the news and instead played a \u0027pirated copy of Zootopia he bought at a DVD stall.\u0027    The sun sets in Pyongyang pictured last April where Jeppesen was shocked to see housing unit spies and locals gawk at pet animals at the zoo          Locals are pictured walking around the North Korean capital in a photo from April 2017For the student, the hardest part of the experience being constantly watched as he assumed his hotel room, computer and phone were all bugged.\u0027Psychologically, it was very difficult and stressful. It had all these weird side effects. There were moments when I finally was alone and nobody was watching me, yet it felt creepy because I was so used to being watched,\u0027 he said. \u0027Also, even when you’re not being monitored, people are staring because I’m a white guy and they’re not used to seeing foreigners in North Korea,\u0027 he added.He said he felt \u0027psychological stress of not being able to communicate with my parents and my partner back home.\u0027Despite the hardship of being away from family and friends, he opted against buying a SIM card that gives internet access to his mobile phone to avoid having his e-mail spied upon.At the end of his term Jeppesen was awarded a certificate for successfully completing the beginners level Korean language for foreigners course.He returned for an additional two weeks of class last spring. Despite his desire to return yet again, he was not allowed to do so following a US travel ban on the country following the imprisonment and death of American student Otto Warmbier, who was jailed in North Korea after stealing a banner from a hotel in 2016."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/09/05057867000007D0-5800021-image-m-6_1528013181673.jpg","title":"Gangster Kenneth Noye allowed home leave enjoy Sunday roasts","story":"Stephen Cameron (left) was murdered on the M25 in 1996.

Including fares and petrol, travel would cost less than £250.The half term rip-off: Family holidays in the UK to popular...Woman tricked into having a massage by a pervert at Center...Share this articleAt the same time, chain restaurants at the UK parks, such as Café Rouge, Bella Italia, Las Iguanas and Strada, charge more for family meals than at their outlets in other places in Britain.This means Center Parcs and the food brands can take advantage of what are effectively thousands of captive customers. For example, a Rouge Breakfast at Café Rouge is £9.50 at Center Parcs in the UK, which is 60 per cent more than the £5.95 charge at a standard city outlet of the chain.          The price difference is so great that it could be cheaper for a British family to visit a Center Parcs on the Continent rather than in the UK (Pictured: a family on a raft ride at the resort in Sherwood Forest, Nottingham)At Las Iguanas a children’s meal is £7.95, which is 35 per cent more than the £5.90 the chain charges at a city centre outlet. There are also mark-ups on pizza, pasta, drinks and children’s meals at Bella Italia and Strada.It has long been known that Center Parcs hits parents in the pocket by putting up prices at its five UK holiday centres as soon as the schools break for the summer at the end of July.          What is less well known is that the prices to stay at the UK parks, with their woodland lodges, lakes, pools, and sports facilities, are so much higher than the prices in Europe.The UK and European parks are separate businesses, but the accommodation, facilities and services are similar. UK parks offer three levels of accommodation: woodland lodges, executive lodges and exclusive lodges.The standard lodges have a family bathroom, kitchen, TV, wood burner and patio. The top of range options add en-suite bathrooms, housekeeping services, a sauna, a hot tub and, generally, a games room with a pool table. A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle. It sold the European part of the business to a French holiday company and German investment group in 2003.          The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/15/4CA5D84100000578-0-image-m-17_1527345300131.jpg","title":"Churchgoers urged report suspicious behaviour local car wash expose slave labour","story":"    Churchgoers will be urged to report any suspicious behaviour or evidence of workers being abused when they take their car to be cleanedChurch members are also asked to give information on whether the car wash boss ‘appears over-controlling or intimidating’ and whether ‘the body language of workers appears fearful or withdrawn’.The campaign, developed by the Church of England, yesterday won backing from the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, and from the leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols.Francis becomes the first Pope to denounce a \u0027culture of...Church of England tells parishes not to publish prayer...Share this article     It comes as part of a Church of England scheme to help victims of slave labour (file image)For this reason people using car washes are asked by the churches to check whether they can pay through electronic banking systems as well as by cash, and whether or not the car wash offers its customers receipts.The Church of England Bishop of Derby, the Right Reverend Alastair Redfern, said: ‘It is shocking that an act as simple as having one’s car washed can help perpetuate the human misery involved with modern slavery.‘This practice, and our indifference to it, needs to be challenged and reversed.’Bishop Redfern said the campaign ‘is looking to mobilise the Church’s grass roots presence in an unprecedented intelligence gathering exercise to better understand this problem’.He added that information provided by people using the Safe Car Wash App ‘will help the police and other agencies calibrate their responses accordingly’.The Clewer Initiative said: ‘The more people that use the mobile app the better quality intelligence we will be able to provide to the police and the greater the chance that perpetrators will be prosecuted and victims rescued.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/22/4CE245F300000578-5801525-image-a-87_1528062475739.jpg","title":"Mary Berry slashes 150 000 price six bed mansion","story":"    Mary Berry, 82, and her husband decided to move from their home in Buckinghamshire to greener pastures in Henley          The eighteenth-century Queen Anne-style farmhouse boasts a number of attractive featuresThousands of bottles of Mary Berry’s £3 salad dressing are...Better than the Bake Off tent!

Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) has put a UK-wide ban on candidate lists for workers coming into the firm at a senior level that do not include any womenWhile Deloitte and EY do not have an outright ban on all-male candidate lists, they said they too look for a erse range of employees.Following compulsory gender pay reporting rules which came into force following a Government consultation in 2016, companies with more than 250 staff must declare their gender pay gap.As a result many financial services companies are reconsidering their hiring policies. Price comparison website GoCompare recently insisted on an all-female shortlist for an executive position. It comes as it was revealed last week in a report that top executives had been using ‘pitiful and patronising’ excuses to keep women out of boardrooms.FTSE company chiefs claimed women ‘don’t want the hassle’ of top jobs and could not deal with ‘complex issues’. The report, backed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, then published a list of the worst culprits after it emerged ten of the UK’s biggest firms lacked a single female board member.On the same day as the report, the Treasury picked the only man on a shortlist of five for a role on the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee.The appointment of the academic, Jonathan Haskel, sparked fury from women’s campaigners.The Treasury said in a statement: ‘We actively contacted 44 women to apply for this role, 80 per cent of those interviewed were women and the majority of those on the interview panel were women.

A family of four staying for seven nights at a woodland lodge in Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire, at the start of August would have to fork out £1,958.That is more than double the price of £909 for similar accommodation at the German Center Parc at Hochsauerland, in Medebach.It is also some £930 more than a premium cottage at the De Vossemeren park, in Lommel, Belgium, which is around £1,027.The holiday company was set up by a Dutch entrepreneur and later bought by the British brewing and hospitality chain Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle.

The British business was subsequently bought by the American private equity firm Blackstone.Consumer advocate Helen Dewdney, who runs The Complaining Cow website, said: ‘It is really shocking that British families can be charged hundreds of pounds more than those in Europe for what is effectively an identikit holiday, but this is typical of rip-off Britain.’ Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, was particular critical of the higher food prices. ‘Families have already paid a lot of money for their Center Parcs stay and will be rightly upset to find they are being charged inflated prices for the food at chain restaurants on site,’ he said.A Center Parcs spokesman said: ‘Center Parcs UK is a separate company to Center Parcs Europe we operate in very different market conditions.‘We heavily reinvest in our accommodation, activities and restaurants each year and our pricing is based purely on demand for the short break experience we offer in the UK, which does differ from Center Parcs Europe significantly.’Café Rouge, Bella Italia and Las Iguanas are all part of a company called the Casual Dining Group.A spokesman said: ‘As is common practice across many retail businesses, such as car dealerships, supermarkets and restaurants across the UK, we operate a range of different price brackets across our brands, dependent on where a site is located.’Strada did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/03/10/4CDECA9700000578-0-image-a-6_1528018447154.jpg","title":"Pubs Britain remove Saudi Arabia flags World Cup bunting","story":"    The Air Balloon pub in Filton, Bristol.

I will not stand by and do nothing while there are landings after landings,” he later told a crowd in the city of Catania. “We need deportation centres.”His visit came as at least 35 people were reported drowned off the coast of Tunisia, which has become a major departure point for migrants seeking to reach Italy. The Tunisian defence ministry said 67 others were rescued by the coastguard, and the search continued. Around 180 people were believed to be on boardAs interior minister of Italy’s new populist government, sworn in on Friday, made up of ministers from the League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), Salvini has pledged to “send home” around 500,000 undocumented immigrants. His plans have prompted alarm among migration experts and humanitarian groups, although they are also seen as highly unrealistic as Italy does not have resources to pursue mass deportations.“I’m going to Sicily to see where the latest landing took place,” Salvini told reporters at the presidential palace in Rome ahead of the visit. “The good times for illegal migrants are over.”The interior minister also described NGO rescue boats as “smugglers’ deputies” for their role in bringing migrants to safety. Riccardo Gatti, head of the Open Arms rescue mission, predicted its work would become more difficult. “Salvini will not simply make worse the future of the people who save lives at sea, but the life conditions of the migrants,” he said. “Since I’ve started working at sea, dealing with rescue operations, I have seen how our work is becoming harder and harder. Writing in Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper, Soros said that the strong showing of the League, Italy’s largest rightwing party, could partly be attributed to “Europe’s flawed migration policies that imposed an unfair burden on Italy”. He said that if the EU wanted to “constructively influence” the next elections, which he believes may be sooner rather than later due to the “uneasy” alliance between the coalition partners, it must address that burden.“Until recently, most refugees could move on to northern Europe, where they wanted to go,” he wrote. “But since September 2015, both France and Austria closed their borders and the rescued migrants were stuck in Italy. This situation was not only unfair but also financially very burdensome at a time when Italy was economically lagging behind most other European countries. That was the main reason why Lega Nord, in particular, did so well in the recent elections.“It follows from the voluntary principle that the problem ... cannot be addressed by forced resettlement, but only by the EU financially compensating Italy for the migrants that land there.” The controversial Dublin rule requires that would-be refugees must file for asylum in the first bloc member-state they enter, heavily penalising Italy, which has seen 700,000 migrants arrive – the vast majority from north Africa – since 2013. The introduction of EU-backed processing centres to ensure migrants are identified at their first European entry point and tighter border controls installed by France, Switzerland and Austria have compounded the problem.Salvini will be in Luxembourg on Tuesday for a meeting of EU interior ministers with the agenda set to be dominated by discussion about the Dublin rule.The Hungarian-born hedge fund owner’s generous backing for charities helping migrants, and support for the EU’s resettlement plan during Europe’s 2015 refugee crisis, brought him into direct conflict with ultra-conservative, rightwing governments.Most markedly, Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, based his successful re-election campaign this year on attacking a supposed “Soros plan” to flood Hungary with Muslim migrants. In his opinion piece, Soros rubbishes the accusation as “false and ridiculous”. As hundreds of leftwing activists gathered this morning in Sicily to protest against Salvini’s controversial anti-immigrant plan, a man killed a 29-year-old asylum seeker from Mali and injured two in Vibo Valentia, Calabria. Police said the migrants were stealing material from an industrial site in the area.

Last week, it urged the government and the European Union to fight sanctions imposed by Donald Trump’s Republican administration, which it said would harm steel exports.The EEF, which represents manufacturers, said the continued political uncertainty over Brexit negotiations had dragged down business investment to the lowest level for a year. A poll of more than 300 manufacturers found they remained generally positive, with business confidence holding up looking forward to the second half of the year. “However, the durability of this upturn is looking somewhat more fragile as many of the positive forces driving expansion last year such as a resurgent eurozone, a surge in global manufacturing investment and competitive pound are starting to fade,” said the organisation’s chief economist, Lee Hopley.“New or heightened uncertainties have come into play, not least what feels like crunch time in the Brexit negotiations which have led to amber lights flashing again on the business investment outlook.” The manufacturing sector has failed to regain the level of output seen before the financial crash in 2008. In the recession that followed, hundreds of companies went bust or moved production overseas. Low oil prices and slump in the value of sterling helped manufacturers to increase exports during 2016 and 2017, but firms recorded weaker growth in the first quarter of the year as the stuttering Brexit talks increased uncertainty and a rise oil prices coupled with a higher pound increased import costs.Tom Lawton, of the business advisory firm BDO, which helped with the research, said companies were still cautiously optimistic, but “we are starting to see the impacts of the ongoing political and economic uncertainty on the UK manufacturing sector”.

Britain, so the story runs, is an exceptional country with an exceptional history, exceptional institutions and an exceptional destiny. For Europeans inured to political instability and bloodshed, supranational institutions are needed to keep the peace. These chosen British lands have no such need. The Brexit vote was a protest vote against an order that had created insupportable lives for too many British citizens, intensified by fears over immigration, but it was underpinned by this cultural narrative of Britain’s uniqueness.Like all caricatures, this story contains enough truth to be plausible. As the dominant part of an island to the west of the continent, England after 1066 was able to develop parliamentary government, religious toleration and common law without the periodic invasions that beset other parts of mainland Europe. It was not occupied by Napoleon or Hitler or ravaged for decades by territorial-cum-religious war. It was first into the Industrial Revolution and built the most extensive of the European empires on the basis of maritime prowess as an island nation. It was on the winning side in the 20th century’s two world wars. English, once spoken only in the Thames valley, became the world language.But there are limits to this account. It greatly overstates the uniqueness of English history, our differences with Europe and our differences with the other nations of the British Isles.We have never been truly orced from our continent. How could it be otherwise? England’s violent record in Ireland, Scotland and Wales should disabuse anyone who thinks our history is distinctively peaceful – and our record in empire-building was of a piece. All the currents that have shaped us – Roman, Saxon, Danish and Norman occupations, the Renaissance, the rise of Protestantism, the gains of overseas expansion, the concept of the nation-state, universal suffrage and the welfare state, industrialisation, the brutalities of early capitalism and the emergence of socialism – have shaped the rest of Europe, too. The development has been symbiotic.Thus, Magna Carta was part of a family of European settlements that fettered monarchical feudal rights across Europe. England’s break with Rome under Henry VIII prefigured the cataclysm that overcame the Holy Roman Empire England was part of the European state system established by the 1648 peace of Westphalia.Sometimes, as with industrialisation, Britain was ahead of the pack, although we soon lost the advantage to Germany. Sometimes, as with votes for all women over 21 in 1928 or laying the foundations of a welfare state before the First World War, we were well behind Scandinavia and even ex-colonies Australia and New Zealand. On the welfare state, we took our cue from Bismarck. The Enlightenment was a pan-European movement. Indeed, there is a powerful argument for viewing the British Industrial Revolution as a European event, given how many of the key inventions had origins in European thinking and in immigrants, many of them refugees compelled to seek better lives here.The truth is that Britain has been integrating immigrants and sharing sovereignty for centuries. As urban centres grew and trade and cultural networks flourished, supported by revolutionary advances in technology from the three-masted sailing ship to the printing press to electrification to containerisation, these connections have woven Britain, Europe and the rest of the world closer together.This interconnectedness has made cooperation more, not less, essential over time. Since 1834, Britain has signed more than 13,000 treaties and international conventions – a red-tape mountain – virtually all of which have diluted our notional sovereignty while advancing our national interest. The EU continues this process. The EU buildings that Boris Johnson sees ominously “looming over cobbled Brussels streets” are not representatives of some terrifying “other”: none of the EU’s members has ambitions – whether public or cryptic – to submerge their nation into a federal superstate. There is no European army massing in Calais. The EU’s buildings represent an often ticklish interdependence in which we Europeans devise solutions to shared problems – from environment to trade, from security to terrorism – that we could not have applied on our own. It is a construct for the future. Brexit is a step back to an imagined past that never existed.Even as England became a separate state from parts of the European mainland in the 16th century, engagement remained intense. Elizabeth I spoke six European languages and regarded herself as a “prince of Europe”. Resisting marriage advances by French and German princes lest they cramp her options, she was as deeply engaged as any of them in the culture and politics of the European Reformation and Counter-Reformation.Shakespeare’s Jaques (As You Like It) said that “all the world’s a stage”, but Europe was Shakespeare’s actual stage – all of it, together with its history: Venice, Verona, Sicily, Denmark, Athens, Rome, Paris, Vienna, Milan, Naples, Mantua, Cyprus, Bohemia, Illyria (Croatia), Navarre (Spain), Troy and Antioch (Turkey). And most exotic of all, the unnamed, heavenly Mediterranean isle of The Tempest, of which Caliban tells the shipwrecked Stephano: “Be not afeard. The isle is full of noises, Sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.” Political unions between England and mainland Europe continued long after Mary I, married to Philip II of Spain, was evicted from Calais in 1558. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 brought William of Orange (the Netherlands) to the English throne. After the death of the childless Queen Anne in 1714, the throne passed to her cousin George, Prince of Hanover, an Anglo-German union of crowns that continued until Queen Victoria’s accession in 1837. Victoria promptly united with Saxe-Coburg in her marriage to Prince Albert. Victoria’s great-great-granddaughter, Elizabeth II – Elizabeth I of Scotland, which “the Faerie Queene” did not rule – is cousin to the kings or queens of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands. Her husband, Prince Philip, is a prince of Greece and Denmark and son of a German princess.So the monarchy is the most European of English institutions, just as it is the most Scottish and Welsh. It is nonetheless ambiguous. For as well as her European relationships, the Queen continues to be head of state of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. She is also head of the Commonwealth, a club of 53 mostly ex-colonies which still have strong cultural, educational, sporting and economic links to Britain despite the relative decline of the mother country. If those bonds are weakening, it is not because of the EU – it is because of Britain’s fading economic and political relevance.A similar story of tension between England Alone and European Britain is told across England’s intellectual, political, diplomatic, religious and cultural life. David Hockney was strongly influenced by Picasso, David Bowie’s talent flowered in Berlin, George Orwell wrote in Paris and Catalonia. Isaac Newton was far more internationally famous than Shakespeare in his day, because he wrote for a European audience in Latin. Only since the late 18th century have English language and culture held significant sway in mainland Europe. Even then, it took 150 years of revolution, turmoil and occupation for London to replace Paris as the capital of Europe. By the late 18th century, Britain’s leading scholars were writing in English, but no less engaged in Europe for their ideas and influence.Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, started writing The Wealth of Nations in Toulouse, while touring the continent as tutor to the Duke of Buccleuch. He met Voltaire in Geneva and David Hume in Paris, where his fellow Scot was secretary of the British embassy. Hume introduced him to all the great writers of the French Enlightenment. Smith even intended – his sudden death intervened – to dedicate his great book on the “invisible hand” of the free market to François Quesnay, a French economist as well as physician to Louis XV.The Industrial Revolution arrived in Britain not just because of British genius, or because we had abundant coal and running soft water, but due to the interplay with the European Enlightenment. The leading economic historian Joel Mokyr argues that the quest for knowledge that defined the Industrial Revolution – led by great inventors such as James Watt, Richard Arkwright and Josiah Wedgwood – was inspired by an Enlightenment seeking to open up the world to the force of reason.Inventors and thinkers alike converged on Britain, whose political institutions, tolerance and openness made it a European hub. As Hume wrote: “Notwithstanding the advanced state of our manufactures we daily adopt, in art, the inventions and improvements of our neighbours.” Whether it was Leblanc’s soda-making system, Jacquard’s loom or De Girard’s wet-spinning process, the British proved adept at absorbing European ideas from whatever source to reinforce their technological prowess and leadership.The Industrial Revolution transformed not only British but also European societies and polities. Managing the convulsions and uncertainties associated with industrialisation led to common responses: while the details differed, social unrest allied to Enlightenment views of inidualisation and human rights was a catalyst for democratisation, which opened the door for redistribution and the extension of social and educational rights to the masses. William Beveridge, godfather of the NHS and postwar welfare state, studied extensively the systems of compulsory social insurance for pensions and sickness that Bismarck had introduced into Germany in the 1880s.The greatest Briton, Winston Churchill, exemplifies the English European who never turned his back on the European mainland. Churchill had an American mother and an imperial destiny from his boyhood at Harrow and Sandhurst, as a young officer on India’s North-West Frontier and then a reporter in the South African war. Yet he was equally proud of being a descendant and biographer of the Duke of Marlborough, victor of Blenheim in league with Germans against the hegemonic Roi Soleil, Louis XIV.And therein lies an episode of significance for the history of Europe. While visiting Marlborough’s battlefields in Bavaria in 1932, Churchill nearly met Hitler. The Nazi leader, about to take power, had been due to meet Churchill at his hotel in Munich but – in a moment rich with symbolism – he cancelled at the last minute because Churchill had berated the Nazi leader’s press secretary the night before about antisemitism.“Why is your chief so violent about the Jews? What is the sense of being against a man simply because of his birth? How can any man help how he is born?” Churchill recalled saying. And the upshot: “He must have repeated this to Hitler, because about noon the next day he came round with rather a serious air and said that the appointment could not take place.”Maybe the most fateful non-meeting in history.Churchill never saw empire as a reason for British isolation from Europe. Faced by the ultimate crisis, he spurned Chamberlain’s isolationist view of Czechoslovakia as “a far-away country”. Instead, he stood up to Hitler, offered the French an “indissoluble union” to keep them in the war as Hitler’s armies advanced on Paris in June 1940, refused to contemplate the armistice urged on him by his foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, after the fall of France and pursued to the end a war to liberate Europe from “the pestilence of Nazi tyranny”. But note for devotees of Darkest Hour and Dunkirk: Britain was never “alone” and could not have triumphed had it been so. Even in its darkest hour Britain could call on its then vast empire and, within 18 months, on the Americans, too. It also had a powerful defence industry incorporating Europe’s largest and most sophisticated aviation industry, built up in the 1930s by methods that rejected laissez-faire. Britain could and did outproduce Germany.Today’s pro- and anti-Europeans quote different Churchill postwar speeches. “We must build a kind of United States of Europe” is the classic federalist quote from his 1946 Zurich speech. “We are with them, but not of them” is the classic anti-integration quote when he was prime minister for the second time in 1953. However, swapping quotes out of context is no substitute for understanding Churchill’s thinking, which was consistently in favour of strong European engagement.For Churchill, as for Attlee, his internationalist Labour counterpart, the issue of the 1940s was to combine European engagement, imperial power and global partnership with the United States.Churchill’s approach was unambiguously to maximise British influence in all three circles, not to disengage. Seventy years after Llandudno, Britain has only one circle left intact – “United Europe” – and it is implausible that Churchill would have favoured disengagement from that one. On the contrary, he would have seen British leadership of the EU as all the more imperative because it is now our principal circle of influence. He would have been equally resolute in support of Nato, being the legacy of his wartime alliance with the United States that still secures British security and influence, but it is inconceivable that he would have regarded this as a substitute for the EU.The key point about Churchill’s 1953 “with them but not of them” remark is that it was in the context of France and Germany debating the establishment of an integrated “defence community” separate from the US, a stillborn precursor of the economic community that they went on to found in 1957.Churchill was not in principle against close military engagement with France and Germany, but in the context of the early 1950s he did not want to weaken the Anglo-American bedrock of Nato by supporting a speculative bid for a European army.In the event, the French parliament rejected the defence community, for reasons similar to Churchill’s. However, on economic cooperation Churchill was consistently positive. “We are prepared to consider, and if convinced to accept, the abrogation of national sovereignty, provided that we are satisfied with the conditions and the safeguards,” he said of the Schuman Plan in 1950. A year later, he was more explicit in disowning isolationism: “There are disadvantages and even dangers to us in standing aloof.” And after he left No 10, he supported Macmillan’s application to join the EU, having privately opposed Eden’s ill-fated Suez expedition in 1956.“In defeat, defiance” was another Churchill maxim. He never gave up the struggle to change public opinion and the Conservative party to his way of thinking, even when threatened with deselection as Tory MP for Woodford in Essex, now Iain Duncan Smith’s constituency, for opposing Chamberlain on his Munich agreement with Hitler to dismember Czechoslovakia.The Brexiter argument that Britain has outgrown the old continent has a long pedigree. Global Britain, descended from the “blue water” tradition, assumes a future in which Britain escapes European geography, European engagement and European immigration. Out in that blue yonder, there are no risks, no power imbalances and no limitations on sovereignty.This Global Britain, ludicrously branded “Empire 2.0” by some Brexiters, is a piece of flimsy nonsense, particularly as our former empire is entirely self-governing, the Commonwealth is a club with no clout and there are no uncolonised continents besides the Antarctic ripe for exploitation. The reality is that British strategic thinking has always been – has always had to be – at least as European as global. To argue, as Brexiters do, that we are not leaving Europe but rather the EU is elemental fatuity. The institutions of the EU are today’s Europe: they are where Europe’s states cut their deals, organise the economics, politics and security of our continent, hammer out joint foreign policy and are through which the shared rules that keep our borders open to the friction-free movement of goods, services, money and people are sustained. And all is congruent with democracy, the rule of law and accountability. They are a magnificent achievement. To argue differently is to traduce the evidence of our eyes – and a betrayal of our interests as a European power.For European balance-of-power politics, so advancing our national interest, has been a central theme of our history. We resisted the emergence of Spain, then France and then Germany as would-be dominators of our continent by building countervailing alliances. We helped defend Europe against outside predators – the Turks in their time, and in the last century the Soviet Union. The crusades, misguided as they were, were in their day quintessentially European. Britain built its overseas possessions in part to secure a better counterweight in Europe.As Churchill said, Europe is “where the weather comes from”. It is a Brexit fallacy that being out of the EU means being spared what happens in the EU and the eurozone. Britain has an existential interest in what happens in Europe, as it always has. There is no hiding place in the Atlantic.Today, risks are mounting, democracy is under threat worldwide, even in recently confident and progressive western Europe and North America. Putin’s Russia is behaving like the fascist regimes of the 1930s, backed by sophisticated raids from online troll factories. Citizens – and ominously younger voters in some European countries – are more and more willing to tolerate the subversion of democratic norms and express support for authoritarian alternatives.Oleg Kalugin, former major general of the Committee for State Security (the KGB), has described sowing dissent as “the heart and soul” of the Putin state: not intelligence collection, but subversion – active measures to weaken the west, to drive wedges in the western community alliances of all sorts, particularly Nato, to sow discord among allies, to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and thus to prepare ground in case the war really occurs. To make America more vulnerable to the anger and distrust of other peoples.In Brexit-voting Weymouth, Captain Malcolm Shakesby of Ukip is unruffled by Putin or European populism. He inhabits the cartoon world of British exceptionalism, and his main concern today is Mrs May’s “sellout” of the referendum result. Brexit, uncorrupted, will be a success. “It will work because the British people are resilient,” he says. Then, in full Dunkirk mode: “In the Second World War, when we were down, we managed to pull through. The French couldn’t hack it, the Netherlands couldn’t hack it, the Belgians couldn’t hack it. We would have done what Churchill said, fight them on the beaches. That’s what nobody else ever does.” Of course Churchill did not actually do that – fighting on the beaches – and his whole statesmanship was to ensure that we did not have to, either.The MP for Shakesby’s South Dorset constituency is a Conservative who won the seat from New Labour in 2010. He, too, is a captain, one Captain Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, educated at Harrow, then Sandhurst and the Coldstream Guards, grandson of Admiral Sir Reginald Drax and great-grandson of Lord Dunsany, second oldest title in the peerage of Ireland. Drax is quintessential governing class. At least six of his ancestors since the 17th century were MPs for Dorset or Gloucestershire. His home: the ancestral seat, Charborough House, Grade I listed, deer park and 7,000 acres. The grounds are open to the public twice a year, when the villagers of Sturminster Marshall are admitted to sell tea and cakes.Drax’s view on Brexit? “Resignation is the only honourable path” for MPs who won’t accept it. Drax is tribute to the Faragist takeover of the Tory party. It is a party now indifferent to Britain’s place in Europe and blind to the vital need for full engagement with our continent.

One was obviously tautologous waffle and the other was just as obviously untrue. Now that both have been abandoned, we can see that untruths are sometimes better or at least more informative than waffle.Brexit will always mean Brexit, but it has become horribly clear that even a very bad deal would be preferable to no deal at all. Leaked research done within David Davis’s Department for Exiting the EU suggests that without deals on customs and trade, parts of the UK would run out of food and even medicines within a\u0026nbspfortnight of the present agreements lapsing – and that is not the worst possible scenario: it is one that lies in the middle of the range of possibilities.The architects of Brexit, the people who brought us to contemplate this brink of ruin, know that perfectly well. Lord Lawson has applied for residence in France Dominic Cummings publishes a hysterical screed denouncing everyone but himself for the consequences that everyone else had all along warned were inevitable. For the rest of us, those without properties to retire to abroad, money to invest elsewhere, or even a fantasy world to retreat to where everything goes according to the glorious plan, the problem remains. What is to be done?This is not a problem that the UK can solve on its own, even if it is one we caused. The costs of Brexit will largely be borne by the British but some will fall on the EU27 as well. It is in no one’s interests to have Britain decline into a sullen and impoverished island locked for decades into a bitter and interminable argument with itself over who was to blame for its condition, like a orced man drinking alone in a bedsit. Who would want that for a neighbour?The first requirement is realism, on both sides. The long, forensic speech by Sir Ivan Rogers, who was, until he resigned last year, Britain’s chief negotiator in Europe, argues that all three of the preferred political stances towards Brexit at the moment are based on self-delusion. He does not believe it will be possible to reverse the decision nor – of course – to reach the sunlit uplands promised by Boris Johnson. Neither does he suppose that the aim of the present government, to “resume total control of our laws, borders and money and exercise full sovereignty, without intrusion by a foreign court, but still retain virtually all the benefits of current trading arrangements with our former partners, whilst erging from them to taste, wherever we derive advantage” is anything other than a fantasy. That will become clear enough over the next 10 months, just as the cost of “no deal” has done.At the same time, the EU cannot expect that a future British government will see the error of its ways and come back begging for forgiveness and a\u0026nbspfresh start. The worse the consequences of Brexit become, the more the leavers will blame them on unreasonable foreigners. Nor will this kind of nationalist rage against Brussels be confined to the UK. The inability of the eurozone to deliver prosperity or even hope to large swathes of southern Europe results from policy errors that must urgently be addressed. The “addiction to austerity” of which George Soros recently warned may come to seem an act of collective self-harm that stands comparison with Brexit. The realism to recognise facts, the humility to accept them, and the courage to act on them, have seldom been more needed on both sides of the Channel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deca6a179ea5662fc0eef9e3daf669ae1e3cead8/0_3_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a1f5b7950687c8ace7d2c2a3b4a5ca9","title":"tories islamophobia gentrified theresa may rightwing politics","story":"The lack of pressure on Theresa May to act is an alarming indication of where rightwing politics is taking BritainThe Conservative party has a problem with Muslims. It is not a few bad apples not a few social media posts taken out of context. The problem has been growing unchecked for years, despite warnings by Muslim party members, and has now become so normalised that incidents are being reported with alarming frequency. Last week, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following more-than-weekly occurrences in the party last month. In these past four weeks alone, Conservative party representatives and candidates have called Islam “the new Nazism”, posted a picture of bacon on a door handle as a way to “protect your house from terrorism”, and shared an article that called Muslims “parasites” who “live off the state and breed like rabbits”.Muslim party members also reported casual racism linked to the religion, and conversations where it was heavily implied or overtly spelled out that to get ahead in the party, they had to shed as much of their Muslim identity as possible. This is now a pattern. Peter Oborne wrote last week that in his research over the years he has shown that it is impossible for a practising Muslim to make his or her way to the very top of the Tory party.Prejudices do not just land at the door of certain parties. They bubble upwards from some foundational corruption. There is a reason that the anti-Muslim bigotry that has developed over the last two decades nested on the right, and found a home in the Conservative party. There is an overlap between specific antipathy towards Muslims and general hostility towards immigration, a cornerstone Tory attitude. And there is a reason it has intensified under the auspices of today’s party. A nativist\u0026nbspgovernment tone sharpened after the Brexit vote and overtures to the far right have won over Ukip voters and even ex-BNP supporters.Just as antisemitism on the left arises from a warped, conspiratorial view of a world in which Jews are enablers of powerful interests that conspire against the weak, anti-Muslim prejudice on the right arises from an obsession with immigration gone haywire, hence Muslims are hordes, invaders, breeding like rabbits and changing the culture with their creeping sharia.Hate speech against Muslims also conveniently channels a racial element that on its own would meet with far more opprobrium. There are many fig leaves that cover the naked prejudice, such as: people have legitimate concerns about immigration Muslims change the culture of a place far more than people of other religions do is it so wrong for a nation to want to preserve its culture? A handy manual for this sort of obfuscation is Douglas Murray’s The Strange Death of Europe: a masterclass in how xenophobia can take on a respectable shape by sublimating prejudice towards Muslims – and by extension immigrants – into a legitimate cultural anxiety.But the biggest fig leaf of all is that, somehow, it is all just legitimate criticism of Islam, that no one really has an intrinsic problem with Muslims. There is not much value in arguing against this logic because it is a set-up. Those who have been grappling with the whole “Islam is not a race” ersion for a while now know that it is obvious that hate speech, mockery, calling for internment and damaging people’s employment prospects, as studies have found, is not a legitimate interrogation of a faith. The religion-not-race canard is a threadbare semantic excuse deployed cynically by those who know that, once the religion element is stripped away, all that is left is the racist bigotry.A party that engages in populist rhetoric against immigration, the party of the Windrush scandal and the “go home” vans, is the natural home for the politics of fear. Zac Goldsmith’s shameful smear campaign against Sadiq Khan still stands as its monument. On Sunday morning, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, dismissed the MCB’s claims, citing its supposedly “favourable comments” on extremists, and refusing to engage with the fact that senior Tories, journalists and junior party members have all made the same claims. This is deliberate strategy. Raise the spectre of extremism and just hope everyone moves on.Of course legitimate interrogation of Islam can be, and is often, mislabelled as anti-Muslim prejudice, just as legitimate interrogation of Israel is often mislabelled as antisemitism. But it really is not hard to also see that, just as antisemites use Israel to hide their prejudice against all Jews, anti-Muslim bigots use Islamic extremism to excuse theirs.But the similarity ends there when it comes to popular condemnation. The difference in the public outcry against Labour and Conservative failures to tackle effectively race and prejudice issues in their parties is telling. We have become inured to the sharpness of the tone against Muslims, because criticising Islam has lent a civilising comfort to those who just don’t like Muslims, and Islamophobia has been successfully twinned with immigration in the public consciousness. There will be precious few pundits calling for an inquiry or radio shows asking callers whether Theresa May is fit to lead a party whose members bully and stigmatise Muslims. There will be few voters at the ballot box who will shun the Tory party because it makes their fellow citizens feel unsafe.Pressure must continue to grow on May to tackle the problem, but the only way that can happen is if the cause is taken up by others, not just the MCB. The present situation says much about the Conservative party and the alarming direction in which rightwing politics is taking the country. We’re seeing Islamophobia not just popularised, but gentrified."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f124cf1b8c1509941f2a28f65bb0a5c38732ccf/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX29waW5pb25zLnBuZw\u0026amp;s=605cdd8b92956fd563850206cb6a607f","title":"street cricket the sport transforming birmingham kids lives","story":"In inner-city areas where children have few facilities, it’s easy to fall in with a bad crowd. One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981. NatWest are proud to be the principal partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the official partners of Chance to Shine, reflecting the bank’s own values and commitment to fairness and inclusion.To find out more, visit Natwest Cricket"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1ad3c2a1f080684bed00f508ae332b5959183d/43_0_5671_3402/master/5671.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37ee8c57e3345b15d1351dea7dd9112a","title":"the joy of pints and pies how i learned to love uk holidays","story":"Travel writer Anna Hart on how she finally left her passport behind and learned to love holidaying at home in the UKFor most of my life, travel to me meant going as far as I could for as long as I could. I was a glutton for international trips, ticking off European cities I could visit in a weekend, backpacking around swathes of south-east Asia and Central America, and road-tripping across New Zealand and California. A relentless neophiliac, I firmly believed that “away” was intrinsically superior to “home”.It was a trip to New Zealand that planted the first seeds of doubt about my internationally-attuned travel palate. Campervanning around the islands, I realised that I’d been taking a lot of the delights of the UK for granted: our storied towns and villages the fact that long country walks can be bookended by pints and pies in historic pubs a public transport system that reaches into the peripheries our shark-free waters and uncrowded beaches. When enthusiastic UK-bound Kiwis would ask me for recommendations, I desperately wanted to be able to share insider tips beyond the three cities I’d lived in so far: Belfast, Glasgow and London.This experience gently encouraged me to view my homeland through the eyes of a tourist, and when I returned home, I launched Project UK. I began gently, with a day trip to the Somerset town of Bruton, where I wandered around the Hauser \u0026amp Wirth art gallery and stumbled upon a restaurant, At the Chapel, which I would cheerfully eat at every day. Next was a camping trip to Dorset, travelling entirely by public transport and drinking cider at the Square \u0026amp Compass. I swam off Shetland’s wild, deserted beaches I cycled the Kentish coastline, I rock-climbed in the Peak District, and then I realised that much of what I thought I had to travel for was right here on my doorstep.As well as pure pragmatism - saving time travelling, the absence of a time difference or jetlag, reducing my carbon footprint - there are a growing number of “pull factors” keeping me closer to home, stopping me from straying abroad.Embarking on a meaningful relationship with my home country - rather than flightily flouncing off for flings with far-flung destinations - has enriched my enjoyment of history, literature, music and art. These days I track different destinations and bands via Songkick so I can plan UK city breaks around gigs I want to go to - because Cardiff, Liverpool, Leeds, Belfast, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh are some of the best cities in the world in which to catch a gig. I keep a rolling list of destinations that have, until now, only existed in my imagination – the Yorkshire moors that inspired my beloved Brontës, the lakes that I read about in the poetry of Wordsworth, Shelley and Coleridge, and, um, parts of the Northern Ireland coast that provide the backdrop for sex, blood and gore in Game of Thrones.It’s rewarding to bump into a Glaswegian and enthuse about the burgeoning culinary scene in Finnieston. It’s been satisfying to join up some of the dots and understand why post-industrial Birmingham became the birthplace of heavy metal music. And now, when I read a Daphne du Maurier novel like Rebecca or My Cousin Rachel, I can visualise the Cornish scenery she renders through words. I’ll never lose my lust for long-haul international travel, but learning to see the UK through the wide eyes of a visitor means I’ll never take home for granted again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/023f29a85170eda53eb8ecd4ee1d932ab6ee3fc9/0_0_5651_3391/master/5651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=597bff482d92a878015e406dd1722157","title":"quiz have you got the entrepreneur gene","story":"Dreaming of ditching the nine to five?

Torn rather than sliced, those jagged edges are sharp enough to grate a cut clove of the new season’s softly fragrant garlic, something I like to do when there are good tomatoes in the house for pan con tomate.I was brought up on tomatoes on toast made with sliced white Wonderloaf and tinned tomatoes, so the first time my friend James made it for me the way his grandmother did in Spain, the idea suddenly made sense. The thick, open-pored bread was baked until thoroughly crisp, rubbed with a clove of new, sweet garlic, then moistened with grated tomatoes, olive oil (we used Nuñez de Prado) and flakes of sea salt. I begged for basil, but he said no. At home, his family would probably use pan de cristal, similar to ciabatta but thinner and more crisply crusted, and with a chewier and larger-holed crumb (infinitely superior in other words). It is almost impossible to find here, but pretty much any bread is fine, as long as isn’t too dense, or brown, too crusty or too fresh.As with everything so simple, the details need to be carefully thought through. Stale bread is lighter and more airy than fresh, the olive oil needs a peppery kick and the tomatoes are best when verging on the over-ripe, so they collapse into a juicy dressing. A simple thing, perfectly executed.On a slightly more complex note, I’ve been baking this week: a savoury apricot and rosemary-scented foccacia made specifically to go with goat’s cheese. It was worth taking 10 minutes to cook the fruit before adding it to the dough, the result being silky fruit but also a fantastic apricot and rosemary-scented oil with which to moisten the baking bread. As a fruit and herb bread for a sharply lactic, snow-white cheese, it proved easy to make and difficult to beat.ciabatta or pan de cristal 200gcherry tomatoes 400g, ripe but not too sweetolive oil 4 tbspgarlic 3 or 4 cloves Split the bread lengthways. This is easiest with a very long, slim-bladed knife, but tear rather than slice if possible. Cut each half into pieces roughly 7cm x 9cm.Using a coarse-toothed grater, grate the tomatoes into a mixing bowl, then stir in the olive oil with a good pinch of sea salt.Place the bread, cut side up, on a baking sheet and brown lightly under an overhead grill, or else cut side down on a hot griddle.Peel the garlic and cut each clove in half. Rub the garlic over the surface of the toast, discarding each piece as it loses its juice, then spoon the tomato and olive oil over the toast. Trickle with a little more olive oil and serve, with more salt for those who wish it.I have long been an advocate of the baking stone – a thick piece of stone or chunky unglazed tile left in the bottom of the oven to heat up, on which to cook bread or pastry. The extra heat held by the stone ensures a crisp base to pies, loaves, tarts and foccacia. My own has done years of service both as direct heat for a pizza or loaf and as something on which to sit a baking sheet or tart tin. If you are thinking of picking one up for your oven, may I suggest the heavier the better? Whatever, they do wonders for a foccacia.For the dough:strong white bread flour 500geasy-bake yeast 1 7g sachet sea salt 1 tspolive oil 2-3 tbspwarm water 350mlapricots 400golive oil 4 tbsprosemary 3 bushy sprigsRub the bottom of a baking tin, approximately 22cm in diameter, with a little of the olive oil. Set the oven at 230Cgas mark 7.Put the flour and yeast into a large mixing bowl and crumble in the sea salt, then the olive oil and the warm water. Mix thoroughly, adding more water if necessary, to produce a soft, but not sticky dough.Generously flour a board or work surface, tip out the dough, then knead or fold gently but firmly for about 5 minutes. If you wish, use a food mixer with dough hook.When the dough feels elastic, transfer to a lightly floured bowl, cover with a cloth or clingfilm and leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour, until it has doubled in size.Cut the apricots in half and remove their stones. Warm the olive oil in a shallow pan, add the apricots and let them cook for a few minutes until they have softened. Pull the rosemary needles from their stems and add to the apricots, then set aside.Gently remove the dough from its bowl and push it into the oiled tin, pressing it out to reach the edge.Place the apricots on top of the dough then spoon over the rosemary and oil from the tin. Cover with a cloth and leave to rest in a warm place until the dough has risen almost to the top of the tin.

The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57082aedd34f2e7176d5f6f718ec97c462592add/0_314_3008_1804/master/3008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96a98d8783500ec0d2e620d259547af0","title":"simon cowell says giving up mobile phone has made him happier","story":"Not using phone is ‘a strange experience but really is good for you’, music producer saysSimon Cowell has revealed that he has not used his mobile phone for 10 months in an attempt to boost his mental health and happiness.The music mogul said the move had paid off in terms of his quality of life. “I literally have not been on my phone for 10 months,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “The difference it made was that I became more aware of the people around me and way more focused.“The thing I get irritated with is when you have a meeting everyone’s on their phone – and I was probably in that place too.

The neo soul queen may be upfront about her age – tweaking the lyrics of Me to sing: “This year I turned 46” – but she still has the youthful insouciance that brought her acclaim as a thrilling live performer in the 90s. Drowned by an oversized cream suit and enormous wodge of crimped hair, Badu is the sparky counterpoint to her ultra-tight backing band, bashing out beats on a drum machine as she introduces “the 90s babies” to classics like Next Lifetime and Tyrone.But she’s late, and the curfew comes anyway – after barely an hour, she’s on a mid-set high during Bag Lady when the plug is pulled. It was always going to be this way Badu isn’t renowned for her punctuality, for a start, but Field Day, now in its 11th year, is under strict orders to keep a lid on the noise and chaos. This is the festival’s first appearance in south London after events behemoth AEG nudged it out of its slot in east London’s Victoria Park. Residents of the affluent area around Brockwell Park were quick to raise the alarm, warning of vandalism and damage to bioersity. Their concerns seem to have been taken seriously, with curfews strictly monitored and stewards for miles around. The downsizing just about works – Field Day has always had a homespun feel to it – but at times the site feels overwhelmingly packed. With Badu in the headline slot, Friday’s lineup demonstrates a shift in priorities for London’s younger music fans, who have developed a serious thirst for jazz. From the 70s-style ensemble showdowns of Moses Boyd Exodus and the Comet Is Coming to the hypnotic Ethio-jazz of Hailu Mergia, about half the day’s acts are loosely jazz, often cross-pollinating with hip-hop, Afrobeat and soul. And on the main stage, the extraordinary falsetto of Moses Sumney heralds a potential successor to Badu’s eccentric crown, with the LA singer beefing up songs from last year’s Aromanticism with violin, clarinet and guitar. The perplexing charms of Jimothy Lacoste start Saturday off on a different note, as north London’s viral wonderkid brings a hint of knowing wit to his absurd iPad pop about “future baes” and London buses. New York rapper Princess Nokia caters to a similarly young and enthusiastic crowd, mixing juicy autobiography with hip-hop, jungle and, on new tracks, early 00s emo. Her a cappella Blink-182 cover is dreadful, but who else would dare?Elsewhere, dance music is the focus. The Barn, a high-spec rave tent, fills up immediately and stays full – Four Tet’s headline slot has to be paused temporarily to relieve the crush. Finally, Fever Ray closes the weekend with a dose of a radical art-punk energy. Karin Dreijer is flanked by two singer-dancers – one in a stunningly grotesque muscle-suit – and an all-women band as she turns the abrasive rave-pop of 2017’s Plunge into a choreographed celebration of queer sex and mental rebirth. The anthemic peak comes with To the Moon and Back, as Dreijer’s voice is drowned out by thousands of (mostly women) hollering: “I want to run my fingers up your pussy!” For once, it’s a welcome disruption to the festival order."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a287333a791cf4c1126d3565f15ce4c4c2a66688/0_164_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d12397a4a9246ca1563e501b57fb82f","title":"patti smith review brighton charismatic goof punk rock poet","story":"The punk rock poet’s snarl was nowhere to be seen and she even got away with telling fans this was a London warmupIt feels a little strange to hear Patti Smith, poet laureate of punk rock, expounding on her love of the Sunday evening Inspector Morse spinoff Endeavour between songs, but here we are. Confined to her hotel room on Friday night by a heavy Brighton sea mist, she says – “I couldn’t see shit” – her evening was enlivened by watching an episode of the period detective drama on ITV3. Over on her Instagram page, she’s even been ruminating on the philosophical qualities of the show’s dialogue.This is not necessarily what one might expect from someone regularly held up as the living embodiment of a certain fearsome rock and roll cool – a woman who recovered from slipping over on stage at Glastonbury by snarling “I fell on my fuckin’ ass … because I am a fuckin’ animal” – but tonight at least, Patti Smith cuts an unexpectedly goofy figure onstage. She fluffs lyrics, stops one song, argues with her backing band about how to end another, chucklingly announces that she’s treating the gig as merely a rehearsal for her appearance at a London festival the following day and demands the house lights be turned up “in case there’s a potential boyfriend” in the audience. Indeed, Smith is so charismatic and likable that she can pretty much get away with anything, up to and including departing the stage midway through the set “to go to the bathroom”, her backing band busking through a medley of Velvet Underground songs in her absence. At the conclusion of Ghost Dance, she tells the audience to raise their arms and “shake out the ghosts” and the venue is suddenly filled with hands dutifully flapping above heads. She plays a cover of Midnight Oil’s late-80s stadium rocker Beds Are Burning, which isn’t much improved by Smith appending some ecologically themed incanting – “Man in his infinite lack of wisdom sent his toxins into the sea!” she bellows – and a plodding version of John Lennon’s Mind Games, which features Smith reading the lyrics off a sheet of paper and concludes with the singer’s own appraisal of Lennon’s lasting message: “He wanted you to make love! Not war! Not war!” Smith has long had a thing for unlikely cover versions – in the mid-90s she was wont to favour audiences with a version of Deep Purple’s Smoke on the Water, while among the selections on her 2012 album Twelve was her interpretation of Tears for Fears’ Everybody Wants to Rule the World – but it’s hard not to think she’s got far better songs of her own tucked away in her back catalogue than either of these. Her own music ranges from chaotic – Because the Night sounds oddly rickety – to transcendent: Dancing Barefoot benefits from having its studio gloss stripped away, a version of Pissing in the River has a glowering power. Listening to her attack Gloria with a ferocity that makes it feel like something she came up with yesterday, rather than 43 years ago, you’re struck by the fact that her voice has proved apparently immune to the ravages of time: she sounds exactly the same at 71 as she did in 1975. It ends with a ragged attack on People Have the Power, prefaced by a sly apology from Smith herself. “I made a lot of mistakes tonight. I always fuck up in Brighton,” she shrugs. “Everywhere else I’m perfect.” And then she heads off, perhaps to see what’s on ITV3.

Take a piece of white sliced and rub it in your hands it quickly turns in to a grey, tacky ball that looks as unappetising as old chewing gum. Try the same with a well-made loaf and it just breaks in to crumbs. Think about the chewing-gum-like lump in your stomach. You may be able to buy a large loaf of that for as little as 45p in the supermarket, but how much good will it do you?“We focus on time – it takes anything from 27 hours to 152 hours to make one of our loaves. The bread is more nutritious, more flavoursome and more digestible. The children are so not used to it, but they are converted,” Barker said. He has passed on his award-winning bread-making skills to more than 12,000 children to date, visiting primary and secondary schools as well as giving classes in his bakery.This inequality gap has grown much bigger in the past decade. Obesity is a disease of poverty, much as cholera was in the 19th century. It does not exclusively affect the poor, and rates are going up across the board, but those who live in deprived areas have far less chance of escaping it – or the catalogue of diseases that come with it, from cancer to diabetes.Researchers studying this “social gradient in overweight” across different countries see a pattern emerging. Obesity is a form of malnutrition, they argue, and the greater the structural inequality within a society, the more that people living under financial and social constraints lack the opportunities for an active, healthy life.Tam Fry, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, says: “The simple matter is that obesity is usually the province of socio-economic grades D and E, who cannot afford fruit and vegetables even when they know about good diet, so they feed their families highly processed food, which is less nutritious.”How we now make our bread – a staple for centuries – sums up the problems of a society where healthy eating comes at a price that is just too high for many. “I don’t touch white sliced bread myself,” said Fry, “but it’s cheap, and you can stuff something cheap between it, which may also be highly processed and unhealthy, and call it a sandwich, a meal. There is a distinct difference between the lower and the middle-class larder.”Barker makes bread the way it has been made for generations, using just well-milled flour, yeast, water, and a little salt. Bread like this is called the staff of life because it contains so many vital nutrients: essential fats, fibre, protein, more than 20 vitamins and minerals, and carbohydrates. Since staples by definition account for a large proportion of our intake, if the staple of the diet is healthy, it is much easier to ensure that the diet overall is healthy. But the nutritional gulf between a well-made wholemeal loaf and a white-sliced factory one is enormous.When whole wheat is milled into white flour, the vitamins and minerals are reduced by more than half. The essential-oil-rich germ, which has the greatest concentration of nutrients, is sold off as animal feed. Concern that over-refining might be leaving humans malnourished compared with their livestock was first raised in 1919, and eventually governments required millers to put back a few of the vitamins and minerals through fortification, although they are not restored to the levels found in wholemeal flour.It was in the early 1960s that scientists at the British Baking Industries Research Association in Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, developed a way of making bread that dispensed with the time required by traditional methods.They found air and water could be incorporated into dough if it was mixed at very high speeds in mechanical mixers. It needed double the quantity of yeast to make it rise, and chemical oxidants to get the gas in, and hardened fat to provide structure – without the fat the bread collapsed, in early experiments.Since flavour develops during proving, the new loaf needed more salt to make it taste of something. It also needed emulsifiers to plug the gaps, enabling the dough to retain more air. The process removed labour, reduced costs and gave much higher yields of bread from each sack of flour because the dough absorbed so much more water. The chemicals needed are now mostly incorporated into a premix of additives with soya flour, and labelled as “flour treatment agents”. Extra pure gluten is added to strengthen the flour so it can survive the factory process. This Chorleywood bread process is now ubiquitous, and just three giant baking companies dominate the British market.White bread like this has a glycaemic index score of around 70 (the GI index measures how rapidly food triggers a rise in blood sugar and the release of insulin). Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates over-stimulates insulin production, leading to blood-sugar highs and lows, which leave you feeling hungry and liable to overeat. Wholemeal bread scores only 50. Stoneground wholemeal is lower still at 30. The slower release of its energy keeps you feeling full longer.On health grounds the choice between the two should be simple. But Barker’s bread costs £2.45 for a large white, and more than £4 for a large speciality wheat and rye loaf. A supermarket white sliced loss leader can cost just 45p. And this is only one example of the poor being routinely priced out of healthier food.Whatever the government comes up with this week, Elizabeth Dowler, professor emerita at Warwick University, who has researched food poverty for the government, says better wages must be part of any solution. Which should mean less cheap bread in shopping baskets.“Obesity is the canary in the mine. It tells us there is something seriously wrong with not just the food system but the whole economic system. When you talk to poor parents about how they manage on very low incomes, you learn that they have so little that food is a long, long way down the list. Unless you address the social contexts in which people live, you’ll never really tackle obesity. What they are up against will continue to defeat them.”Felicity Lawrence is author of Not on the Label (Penguin, £9.99).The price of a basic sliced white loaf – fifth of the cost of a traditionally made white loaf from a specialist bakerNumber of vitamins and minerals in a non-processed loaf of bread which, with essential fats, fibre, protein and carbohydrates, make up what we need for good healthThe number of British four- and five-year-olds who are severely obese when they start schoolGlycaemic index score for a basic loaf of processed white bread its wholemeal equivalent scores 50 and stoneground wholemeal 30"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e09838fec2c7aaed67d8fb7850d91fad95567f8c/0_84_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39b42bc30084476f3be82cfb207a6f20","title":"renters union shoddy housing cost fortune acorn bristol","story":"Faced with soaring rents and mouldy rooms, Bristol’s angry tenants have formed the Acorn renters’ union – and their protests are spreading around the countryIt is a warm, sunny Saturday lunchtime in the centre of Bristol. Somewhere else in the country a royal wedding is about to take place, but here a group of two dozen demonstrators in red T-shirts are heading into TSB, armed with a list of demands. “Private renting isn’t fun,” they sing, “when you’re paying for a slum. Stop it happening to you, better join the Acorn crew. Housing is a human right, won’t give up without a fight”.The organisation behind the good-natured protest is a trade union for renters called Acorn, first set up in Bristol four years ago. Since then, as frustration and anger about the housing market – and particularly the conditions for private renters – has grown, the group has gradually spread around the country, with branches springing up in cities including Brighton and Sheffield. Anny Cullum, an activist and NHS administrator, says that until she got involved in Acorn, “there didn’t seem to be anything similar in the community. The way to ensure you have your right to a proper, decent and dignified way of living is for ordinary people to band together.”Acorn frequently works through direct action: members organise protests in their spare time, taking photos on their mobile phones and sharing them on social media with the aim of embarrassing their targets into agreeing to their demands – forcing landlords to repair mouldy properties or stopping evictions they consider unjust. They have targeted TSB because the bank has clauses in its buy-to-let mortgages that forbid landlords from renting to people on benefits, to asylum seekers, and in some circumstances to students. But on the night before the protest, having notified the bank of their intention to demonstrate, TSB relents an email is sent to Acorn indicating the bank will change its terms and conditions so that buy-to-let mortgage holders can rent to people on benefits.“This is a massive win,” Cullum says, using a megaphone to address the assembled protesters. “If we weren’t here today, we wouldn’t be finding out about this, this wouldn’t be happening.” (Although the group is quick to argue that the other prohibitions ought to change too.) For its part, TSB confirms the policy change in an email the bank says it has been reviewing this “for some time”, but the timing of its concession does not seem coincidental.In April, a group of Acorn protesters in Bristol prevented a court-appointed bailiff from evicting Sally Andrews and her three children from a property owned by Ernest Arathoon, a former director of Bristol City. Andrews complained about the property’s disrepair after moving in a year ago – there were problems with the gas and damp. Arathoon said she was behind on her rent, and the property had only fallen into disrepair after she moved in. Acorn argued that the eviction was illegal anyway, because the tenant had not received the documents she should have done when she moved in, including gas safety and energy performance certificates. The landlord said Acorn had got its facts wrong. “A lot of us showed up – about 30 of us,” says Ajmal Miah, an Acorn activist and student at the University of the West of England. “There was a community of people standing up for this tenant.” There is persistent frustration among Acorn members about private landlords who supply poor quality housing Ballard recalls an early battle on behalf of a woman who had been living with “extreme levels of damp, fist-sized mushrooms growing on the walls of her bedroom”. Acorn members picketed a letting agency and the landlord’s business. Ultimately, the campaign apparently forced the landlord to pay for thousands of pounds worth of damp proofing at the woman’s house.In recent years, rents in Bristol have been soaring, fuelled in part by a buoyant local economy, and also by Londoners, priced out of the capital, moving west. Louie Herbert, an Acorn organiser, says that in the five and a half years he has lived in Bristol, rooms that cost around £250 a month, in the Easton area, are now going for £400-500. This inner city neighbourhood was once multicultural and working class, but Herbert says he has had to move out: “I can’t afford to live in that area any more.”Students in the city have their own set of related concerns. Bristol Cut the Rent is a sister group to Acorn, and its members are frustrated by the price and quality of housing in a city with two expanding universities, Bristol and the University of the West of England. Bristol University student numbers were 17,100 in 2004-5 in 2017-18 they were 25,024. Nic Hamer, a second year who studies English, says: “I struggled to pay my rent in my first year and it was £107 per week – pretty much the cheapest you could pay”.After four years of successful campaigning, Acorn is now recognised by the city council as a voice for private renters. There is wide sympathy in the union for the local authority, particularly since the election of Labour’s Marvin Rees as mayor of Bristol in 2016. While there are repeated complaints that there is not enough social housing, there is also an acceptance that the council’s ability to build is constrained by central government. But that didn’t stop Acorn from opposing a clumsy attempt last year to end a council tax exemption for some of the city’s poorest households. “We were only asking councillors to stick to their manifesto,” says Aidan Cassidy, a former Bristol University student who now works for the local energy supplier, Bristol Energy.There are two tiers of Acorn backers: there are around 500 paying members in Bristol. There is no specific fee, although people are asked to contribute one hour’s pay per month and the website suggests £8, £10 or £15 as possible sums. On top of that there are around 7,500 supporters: those who sign up for the mailing list and could be willing to turn up if needed. With some external support, it is enough to pay for a handful of organisers, and Acorn hopes to boost its presence around the country.Ask Acorn members what frustrates them most about the housing market, and they tend to reply that the system seems increasingly rigged against them. There is too much damp, too much hassle, and economic interests are conspiring to ensure rents keep rising. Sasha Sadjady, a civil servant and one of Acorn’s founder members, says she got involved because renting was “incredibly precarious … places are snapped up in 24 hours. Landlords want to know all sorts of information about you. Then, when you are in the house, you only have six months’ security. Such is the precarity, you are never ever able to feel comfortable in what should be your own home.”Sadjady says what annoys her the most about the housing market is a lack of understanding of the underlying economic forces at work – indicating what sort of longer term politics may emerge from a group like Acorn. “Sometimes it annoys me when you say it amounts to problems with certain landlords. There is always an antagonism there, because they are making a profit out of something that should be your right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b66f9599dc8d8e366ce3e495c77369c76fb55ea/384_137_2580_1548/master/2580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ac0a6ab5d2db503eb349935e2fd3407","title":"alexander zverev dominic thiem showdown french open","story":"Alexander Zverev had not played a five-set match in two previous visits to Roland Garros. On Sunday he completed his third in five days, guided by his Russian-born father, to beat the talented young Muscovite Karen Khachanov 4-6, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in just under three and a half hours.To borrow from Fred Trueman, if the 21-year-old Zverev does win this French Open “he’ll be bloody tired”, although he gave no indication he was about to collapse in a heap on Court Suzanne Lenglen after breaking down the resistance of the 22‑year‑old Khachanov, the world No\u0026nbsp38.The two youngest players left in the draw needed all the energy of youth on a hot, still day. Zverev, seeded second here in Roger Federer’s absence, will take 11 hours and 46 minutes of muscle-sapping baggage into the quarter-finals against the bustling Austrian Dominic Thiem, who stopped him in the third round two years ago.That might not be long by the standards of the past decade but, cumulatively, it is a significant workload, and one Zverev says he is still getting used to, although he bridles at suggestions he lacks staying power over five sets – and he now has a respectable 6-6 record.Asked if he thought Khachanov was flagging at the end, he said: “At the beginning of the fourth I thought ‘OK I can turn this match around’, especially when I saved a few break points. He’s a very fit player, so I don’t think it’s that easy to make him tired. Obviously playing five sets, anyone would get tired a little bit.”He added: “I know who I am. It’s not about learning any more. It’s about trying to find a way and trying to win. That’s what I am able to do in the last few matches, and I’m very happy about that. I’m very happy about being in the quarter-finals here, going the hard way, going the distance every single time and showing myself, showing everybody, that I can play for as long as I need to. If you’re mentally fatigued then something is wrong with you. Physically, it’s not easy to play back‑to‑back‑to‑back five-set matches – but I will manage it somehow.”Thiem, who outlasted a weary Kei Nishikori 6-2, 6-0, 5-7, 6-4, is one of the busiest and quickest players on clay. There will be no rest for Zverev when they return on Tuesday.For Zverev to become the first from his country to win the title since Henner Henkel beat Bunny Austin in 1937, he has to win three more matches. The most daunting challenge will be in the final, barring calamity, against the greatest player in history on clay, the 10-times champion Nadal.To eliminate the Spaniard from the equation, Zverev’s countryman Maximilian Marterer will have to pull off the upset of the tournament, year, decade and millennium on Monday – and then all bets are off. The 22-year-old left-hander from Nuremberg, ranked 70 in the world, can only hope Nadal stubs his toe on the morning of the match.In the top half of that side of the draw, Novak Djokovic served his way through some scrappy moments to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win against the Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, whose blistered feat in the second set can hardly have added to the experience over two hours and 25 minutes on Chatrier.Having dropped just one set on his way into the second week, he said courtside: “I like my connection with the public here. He’s a clay specialist and it wasn’t an easy match. He stayed concentrated with a good deal of intensity.”Djokovic has an unexpected opponent in the quarter-finals – the 25‑year‑old Sicilian world No\u0026nbsp72, Marco Cecchinato, who upset David Goffin 7-5, 4-6, 6-0, 6-3, and becomes the lowest-ranked man to get this far here since Ernests Gulbis in 2008."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38b67906be493a8a5ab1e45f5acd1efec240e570/0_69_4757_2853/master/4757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd460cc8b738cd69770d8f59e6ab82ed","title":"emily defroand england womens hockey world cup","story":"Emily Defroand is late, just, for her interview. Training overran. The England forward is in intensive preparations for the hockey Women’s World Cup, which begins at London’s Lee Valley park in seven weeks’ time. Not that she’s complaining.“It’s all go, go, go,” she says from Bisham Abbey. “We just finished training and we ran over slightly. Next we’ve got a team meeting, and that’s before our next training session. It’s a lot of work. Our gym work is based around being really buff, being strong and preventing injury. To be honest, I don’t think I appreciated it was such a key factor for performance athletes, and it really is brutal. But we wouldn’t have it any other way.”Listening to Defroand run through the schedule of her working week could get you out of breath by itself. It’s double sessions every day, with an emphasis on gym work. Even the rest day, on Wednesdays, is used by many players for swimming and yoga to help their muscles recover from the rest of the week. The Thursday sessions are the most notorious, though not for their physical demands.“Thinking Thursdays” recreates a match scenario but for a game nobody has played before. By changing the rules (two points for a goal, for example, or points for entering the shooting circle), players have to literally think on their feet breaking the habits they have formed and creating new ones. Defroand loves it.Playing club hockey for Surbiton, Defroand is a full-time athlete, benefiting from UK sport funding as part of the Great Britain squad. The 23 year-old’s career has run in tandem with professionalisation and, after graduating from Birmingham University in 2016 with a masters in sports science, she became part of a new generation able to dedicate themselves entirely to the sport. “I submitted my dissertation a couple of weeks after the girls won gold in Rio,” she says. “It’s really been lucky, the timing of it all, it’s been a natural progression for me. I finished university, was able to trial for the squad and now I’m living my dream.”Defroand made her Great Britain debut in February and her current training is as part of that group. Like most of the GB squad, however, she will be representing England at the World Cup. The relationship between the two teams is a fluid one (and, indeed, England earned their second-placed seeding at the World Cup in part thanks to GB’s performance in Rio) and it was while playing under the flag of St\u0026nbspGeorge that Defroand got her first experience of tournament competition at the Commonwealth Games this year.“I will always remember that first game,” says Defroand. “The moment when I stepped out on to the pitch. We’re a sport-mad family and I’d always watched the Commonwealth Games as a kid, every one. I wanted to take a step back and think, you know? To think, wow this is it, this is why I’ve trained so hard. I looked into the crowd and my mum and dad were there and that’s just such a proud, proud moment for myself.”In the countdown to the World Cup, England hockey has encouraged its players to share details of their sporting role models as part of a campaign called Behind Every Great Player. There is no doubt about Defroand’s inspiration her mother, Gill.“My mum has been the biggest influence for me growing up and becoming the hockey player that I am,” she says without a moment’s hesitation. “I got into hockey through her. I started playing at age seven because I used to watch her play every Saturday at our local club in Havering.“Mum would say that I’d steal her stick at half-time and be running up and down the pitch. By the age of 10 or 11 I was lucky enough to be playing in the same team. Since becoming a team-mate my mum’s been my club, my county and my regional manager. She’s my biggest fan and my biggest critic and this campaign is about trying to get that relationship between parent and child, get that support network, because it does make such a difference in sport. My mum has been such a fundamental part of my journey and I can’t thank her enough.”The Lee Valley is not far from the Defroand family home, which adds an extra local flavour to a competition already being billed as the biggest ever women’s sporting event on UK soil. Every England match is sold out and, after winning bronze at the Commonwealth Games in a strong field, the onus is on the hosts to match or better their\u0026nbspperformance.As Defroand counts down the days until the first centre pass, she is typically bullish about England’s potential. “You’ve got a mixture of experience and youth. You’ve got a real blend of pace but complete composure in our team,” she says.“I think we would be kidding ourselves if we didn’t think we could get on that podium. That’s what we focus on day in day out to make sure we get these major medals. Over the last year we’ve come away with a European bronze, Commonwealth game bronze so why not go a few better this summer with our home support behind us?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55a4b482f2cc088c0c9b148127dea72bcd05cd75/0_55_4273_2564/master/4273.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02fa571daf0ba7932dff8eb2ae637611","title":"england pakistan second test day three match report","story":"It is a pity there is no third Test. This one at Headingley was a mirror image of the match at Lord’s except this time England were the resounding victors as Pakistan were thoroughly outplayed. Thus the series ended at 1-1 after no more than six days’ play and it would be a brave person who could predict what would happen if they met again. No doubt England, after a thumping victory by an innings and 55 runs at Leeds, would be confident of prevailing but so they were before the first Test.Here everything went better than anticipated for selectors as well as players and punters. There was blistering strokeplay in the morning from Jos Buttler he reached his half-century with a pull for six off Mohammad Abbas. It is debatable whether that came from the middle of his bat but the one he hit on to the rugby ground building site in the middle distance off Faheem Ashraf most certainly did. It was just as well that this was Sunday, when innocent construction workers were putting their feet up at home.Buttler was left on 80 not out and the rest of us were left wondering why convention had not been defied earlier by parachuting the white-ball king into the Test team. It is still early days in Buttler’s renaissance as a Test player but this is an experiment that must run and run.So England had a lead of 189 and by lunch Pakistan’s three senior batsmen were back in the pavilion. Then the youngsters, with a bit of help from old Chris Woakes, took centre stage with Dom Bess taking his first three Test wickets and Sam Curran, on his 20th birthday, chipping in. It may never be as gloriously simple for this fresh-faced pair but along with the return of Buttler they have brought zest and charm to a side that was in danger of stagnating. Along the way their naivety will be exposed now and again but there is no doubt that both of them are relishing being Test cricketers.The Pakistan batsmen were as hapless as England’s at Lord’s as they were bundled out for 134. First Azhar Ali, the senior man unable to show the way in this series, played all around a full‑length delivery from Jimmy Anderson. Then Haris Sohail punched a drive in the air from the middle of his bat to the left of mid-off. Stationed in this vicinity was Bess, who ed, stuck out a large left hand and it was there that the ball magically resided, a superb catch beyond the capacity of most English off-spinners of my experience. This is not the first time that Bess has had onlookers gasping at his capacity to conjure wickets in the field. Then Asad Shafiq was given out on review when feathering a leg-side catch off Stuart Broad so that Pakistan were creaking at 48 for three at lunch.There were 45 minutes of tranquillity after the break when the pitch had a little doze, and Imam-ul-Haq and Usman Salahuddin were suitably watchful against the old firm. Now Root gave Bess his first bowl of the match. To his first ball Imam skipped down the track and pummelled the ball straight for four he opted to block the last ball of the over, missed it and was lbw in the modern manner after reviewing unsuccessfully. So the irrepressible Bess had registered his first Test wicket.Out came Sarfraz Ahmed oozing gung-ho aggression in response to an almost hopeless cause. He, too, cracked his first ball from Bess to the boundary and then crunched drives against the pacemen at the fielders before he was palpably lbw to Woakes, whose return to Test cricket was only marred by having to leave the field with “tightness to his right quad”.Next Shadab Khan succumbed to Curran, caught at slip by Alastair Cook, a more conventional mode of dismissal than the left‑armer’s first wicket in Test cricket. Now Root could happily fiddle around with his quintet of bowlers amid minimal resistance. The batsmen swung and the fielders unerringly took their catches. Both Faheem Ashraf and Salahuddin holed out against Bess, who ended up with three for 33, and then Stuart Broad returned to mop up the tail to give him match figures of six for 66.So are we any wiser? For many the conclusion after Lord’s was that Trevor Bayliss as coach was obviously a complete duffer on the verge of losing his job so, after this remarkable resurrection, is he now a minor genius? Of course both these conclusions are way wide of the mark. There must be relief for Root and the rest of the England camp at their first win in nine Tests. The players have atoned for that horrible performance at Lord’s.The rehabilitation of Buttler is an obvious and intriguing plus and the blooding of the two uncluttered 20‑year‑olds, Bess and Curran, has added sparkle to the team. They have so much to learn but they are hungry to do that. They are not tailor-made solutions and they will not necessarily be regulars from here onwards the old pros will query Curran’s lack of pace and Bess’s rawness as a bowler on flat pitches but this was hardly the day to dwell upon that.In the meantime the sharing of 11 wickets by Broad and Anderson has provided their most eloquent argument for staying in the team together. But this is nothing more than a start to the rehabilitation of England’s Test team. There is now a two-month hiatus. Come 1\u0026nbspAugust and for the next Test the pitch (at Edgbaston) will probably be flatter and the opposition (India) more formidable, but in the intervening period we are at least spared a constant feeling of foreboding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ce60288cd36a3fe7895dbe2a6f2a09822bd0c5c/0_14_3556_2134/master/3556.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5598e42b89d6fbea7205dc5c33520a","title":"us national spelling bee facial expressions in pictures","story":"Competitors in the Scripps National Spelling Bee often struggle to contain their emotions when asked to spell obscure or complicated words.

The QC35 II are the second edition of the company’s wireless noise-cancelling cans and set the standard by which everyone else is measured.They’re excellent not only for active noise cancelling (ANC) but passive (noise blocked by the design of the headphones, rather than by playing ambient sounds) too, which is where some rivals fall short. Bluetooth connectivity is good, but only supports AAC and not other HD audio formats, a cable is there if you need it and the battery lasts around 20 hours with everything turned on.They have a distinct, tightly controlled “Bose” sound, which most but not all will like. The Bose app allows you to turn down or off the ANC, while volume and playback controls are on the right ear cup. An action button on the left invokes Google Assistant or toggles noise cancelling.They’re light and comfortable, relatively small and understated on the head, fold up for travel and are durable enough to survive day-to-day commuting.Verdict: They’re not quite as feature‑rich as some, but they’re more comfortable and have the best noise cancelling.Sennheiser’s PXC 550 are a bit dull to look at. They’re also not as comfy as some. But being light and relatively airy when worn, they’re more likely to better accommodate those of us with large ears.The PXC 550 have Sennheiser’s characteristic wide soundscape, which sounds less direct than rivals. They lack a little energy with electronica, and bass heads should look elsewhere, but fed guitar and vocals they sound fab.Sennheiser’s app lets you adjust the level of noise cancelling, change the EQ and turn on smart pause, which stops the music when you take them off. Unfortunately, to get smart pause to work reliably you have to wait for two seconds once you turn the headphones on before putting them on. Given you turn them on and off by twisting the earcups into place that quickly gets annoying. The right ear cup has a touch-sensitive pad – tap to pause, swipe right and left to skip, or up and down to adjust volume. A switch turns noise-cancelling off, to dynamic adjustment based on noise level or to maximum, while a button cycles through sound effects such as “club”, “movie” and “speech”.Noise-cancelling is good, but not quite on a par with Bose and Sony, particularly on the daily commute where they struggle to block out noise of fellow passengers and screeching trains.The PXC 550 support aptX for Bluetooth and come with a cable. The battery lasts around 30 hours between charges and the headphones fold up for travel.Verdict: A long-lasting option with a wide soundscape.The headphones you wear can be a statement. If you’re wearing B\u0026ampW PX you’re stating that you like your headphones to look as good as they sound, with much finer, metal-articulated arms, platinum highlights and fabric-covered earcups and headband.The PX aren’t ostentatious, but they look more like a £300-plus set of headphones from yesteryear than the bright plastic of the Beats generation.I found that to get the best out of them you have to crank them up loud, which sort of defeats the point of having noise-cancelling. They’re also more affected by the noise-cancelling, which noticeably changes the sound for the worse when turned on.Noise cancelling is good with droning engines, but not quite as good as the rest in an office or on the commute. They handle the wind the best of them all, however.The B\u0026ampW app allows you to customise the noise cancelling between “office”, “city” and “flight”, including the level of ambient noise let through. Buttons on the right ear cup control playback and volume. Taking them off pauses the music, while they’ll accept music over Bluetooth with aptX HD support, analogue cable or USB-C.They feel heavier and are less comfortable than rivals, with thinner, harder pads that squeeze the sides of your head more firmly. They don’t fold down for travel either.Verdict: They look great and will sound great if you like your music really loud.Sony’s top-of-the-line noise-cancelling headphones may not have a snappy name, but they pack a real punch. They are arguably the best Bose rivals money can buy, matching the standard-bearer in noise-cancelling. What Sony adds is slightly better sound, including HD and hi-res audio support over Bluetooth, and a number of customisation options such as noise-cancelling that can be adjusted either manually or automatically.The smartphone app also allows you to change the perceived direction of audio: to make it sound like the music is coming from in front of you or behind, or all around. There’s a full equaliser too.The right earcup is touch-sensitive – double tap to pause or play, swipe up or down to adjust volume or left or right to skip track. Cover the touch-sensitive area with a hand and it pipes ambient sound into the headphones so you can hear announcements or similar. A switch on the left ear cup can also turn ambient sound on or off.The battery lasts around 30 hours and they fold up for travel and are very comfortable for extended listening periods. The downside is that they’re a bit bigger than the Bose QC35, aren’t great at handling two devices connected at the same time, and aren’t quite as good at dealing with wind noise.Verdict: Ideal if you want more features or don’t like the way Bose sounds.While not exactly cheap, Plantronics’s BackBeat Pro 2 offer wireless noise-cancelling for £100 less than the best of the rest and for the most part you wouldn’t be able to tell.They have a decent set of controls on the outside. Pause, track skip, noise-cancelling switch and volume jog dial are all on the left cup, while the right has a button to fire up the virtual assistant, a power switch and a microphone mute button. Take them off to pause the music, put them back on to start it again.Noise-cancelling is good, but not quite best-in-class, letting in a bit more office chatter than the Bose or Sony. Battery life is an excellent 24 hours or so, but they take around three hours to charge when flat.The Plantronics are very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods, with big, plush ear cups and a nice padded headband, but they do not fold up, only rotating the ear cups to flat.If you like bass with your noise-cancelling, these are the ones for you: they have the deepest bass available here. It’s tightly controlled and doesn’t ruin the rest of the music, sounding great with thumping bass lines.Verdict: Excellent deep bass and good noise cancelling for less.The third-generation Beats Studio 3 Wireless are a step up over previous versions of Dr Dre’s noise-cancelling headphones. They’re available in a range of colours and have cups big enough to accommodate most ears.They’re quite tight on the head, with no rotation in the cups, which means they don’t come close to the Bose or Sony for all-day listening comfort. They do fold up, but not flat like most others, and can be a bit creaky each time they’re opened.Controls on the outside are fairly simple. There’s a big Beats button for controlling playback, hidden buttons above and below that for volume control, and a power button. Press the power button twice to turn off the noise-cancelling, hold the Beats logo to fire up Siri or Google Assistant on an Android phone.They work well with Android smartphones and Windows machines, but better with Apple’s products thanks to the company’s W1 chip. Simply turn them on near an iPhone and the pairing is shared between any other Apple devices you might own. They support AAC audio over Bluetooth, with a strong connection in all scenarios.The active noise-cancelling is good, but not on a par with the Bose and Sony, letting in more commuting noise. The headphones have a particular “Beats” sound, which is energetic and heavy on mid-bass, suiting pop but less so ambient electronica.Verdict: Great if you have an iPhone, but better comfort, sound and noise- cancelling are available elsewhere.Microphones on the headphones detect ambient noise heading to your ear. The system then plays the inverse of those unwanted sound waves through the headphones. The sound waves meet and cancel one another out before hitting your eardrum. This is normally described as active noise-cancelling (ANC) noise blocked by the design of the headphones is described as passive noise-cancelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70110d33c5d6a9db7c3b4b2951078c1bda668bdf/421_79_2126_1275/master/2126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3105efb1d386e8e3b1992885ad7bbc22","title":"amazon delivery firms face legal action over workers rights","story":"GMB union is demanding gig economy drivers get sick pay and national minimum wageDrivers delivering goods for Amazon are to fight for better employment rights, including sick pay, holiday pay and the national minimum wage.The GMB union announced on Monday that it is taking legal action on behalf of members working for three delivery firms used by Amazon, arguing that the companies wrongly classed them as self-employed.A statement from the union, which represents professional drivers, said: “The drivers were required to attend scheduled shifts that were controlled by Amazon, meaning they did not have the flexibility that is integral to being self-employed. In this situation, the couriers were treated like employees in terms of their working hours and the GMB union contends they should be treated as employees in terms of their rights too.”The case is the latest in a string of gig economy legal disputes challenging what unions say is bogus self-employment among couriers and other drivers. The GMB won a landmark judgment against Uber in 2016 and others, including Deliveroo, Addison Lee and CityLink, are all involved in ongoing legal action.The case is being handled by solicitors Leigh Day. Partner Nigel Mackay, a specialist in employment and discrimination law, said seven drivers – including two who had been dismissed – were involved in the claim at this stage and he expected that number would grow. One of the drivers described his experience of leaving the house at 6am, not returning until 11pm at night and as a “thank you” for his hard work, had £1 per undelivered parcel deducted from his wages. On more than one occasion he was told by the company that he would not be paid if he did not complete a route and had sometimes driven when “half asleep at the wheel” in order to ensure he got paid.Two of the members are also claiming that they were dismissed because of whistleblowing, claiming their roles were terminated because they raised concerns about working practice. These included that the number of parcels allocated to drivers resulted in excessive hours andor driving unsafely to meet targets, and that drivers were expected to wait a significant time to load their vans, extending their working hours.  GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: “The day to day reality for many of our members who deliver packages for Amazon is unrealistic targets, slogging their guts out only to have deductions made from their pay when those targets aren’t met and being told they’re self-employed without the freedom that affords.”“Companies like Amazon and their delivery companies can’t have it both ways – they can’t decide they want all of the benefits of having an employee, but refuse to give those employees the pay and rights they’re entitled to.” “Guaranteed hours, holiday pay, sick pay, pension contributions are not privileges companies can dish out when they fancy. They are the legal right of all UK workers, and that’s what we’re asking the courts to rule on.”An Amazon spokesman said delivery providers are contractually obligated to ensure drivers they engage receive the National Living Wage and are expected to pay a minimum of £12 per hour, follow all applicable laws and driving regulations and drive safely. “Allegations to the contrary do not represent the great work done by around 100 small businesses generating thousands of work opportunities for delivery drivers across the UK,” he said.He added: “Amazon is proud to offer a wide variety of work opportunities across Britain – full-time or part-time employment, or be your own boss. Last year we created 5,000 new permanent jobs on top of thousands of opportunities for people to work independently with the choice and flexibility of being their own boss – either through Amazon Logistics, Amazon Flex, or Amazon Marketplace.”In April, the delivery company Hermes, which delivers packages for retailers such as Next, Asos, John Lewis, Topshop and River Island, began a legal battle with eight of its own drivers. It is under pressure to settle after rival delivery firm DPD offered all its drivers sick pay and holiday pay as part of wholesale reforms to its gig working model sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed and died.In 2016 the ride-hailing firm Uber was told its drivers should be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights.Uber, which says its drivers are self-employed, lost its appeal against the decision last year but said it would appeal again. The case could end up in the supreme court this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3f3f2dedec5c39d69820789805ebbb68b0dba0/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba8d67ae52f94fbdbe53d615fbebdb48","title":"japans demographic time bomb can a calendar help otaris single men find love","story":"Dropping birth rates and a dwindling population prompts group of rural men to put their faith in PR to revive their ailing towns, and love livesKeito Kobayashi has swapped his usual work clothes for the uniform of his second job as a volunteer firefighter. He is, the caption in the calendar says, only doing what comes naturally – keeping his family and his village safe. Seigo Fujiwara’s picture shows him staring into the middle distance, his head swathed in a traditional tenugui. The 29-year-old surveyor is looking for a woman with a “beautiful smile” with whom he can travel the world.They and 10 other men from Otari are the faces of Japan’s ticking demographic time bomb. They hope their calendar poses will generate interest from potential love matches and help end their search for love and companionship.Finding a partner in Otari, a village in Nagano prefecture in Japan’s northern Alps known for its dramatic scenery and some of the best skiing in the country, is proving a thankless task for Kobayashi and his friends.Its population is about a third of what it was in the 1950s in the past decade, the number of residents has fallen from 3,734 to 2,795, including fewer than 180 children of primary and middle school age.According to the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, its population will fall to just over 900 by 2060 if current demographic trends persist. As of last March, just 275 men and 218 women in their 20s and 30s lived in Otari.Young women are more likely to leave in search of jobs, and perhaps a partner, while the men are expected to stay and inherit family farms and businesses, leaving them with little prospect of marrying and having children. Otari’s predicament is repeated in many places across the country. According to one study, 869 municipalities – almost half the national total – are at risk of disappearing due to the low birth rate. In a report titled Local Extinctions, the Japan policy council said those towns and villages would cease to function if the number of women in the 20-39 age group falls by more than half by 2040.Yuki Nozaki Quilkey, a former foreign ministry official who advises Otari’s mayor, came up with the idea after seeing the success of the New York fire department’s Calendar of Heroes.She is convinced that Otari’s best hope of long-term survival is attracting a small number of young professionals who are sick of city life but do not have any connection to the countryside.She is behind a programme to disassemble some of the village’s grand, but abandoned, farmhouses and move them to more convenient locations in the hope of attracting start-ups. Two tech companies are due to start sharing a renovated 250-year-old house in the village next year.“The time came to dispense with the laissez-faire attitude and actually do something to rejuvenate the village by incorporating its assets into a proper business model,” she says. “The calendar was the first step in changing that mindset. It was money well spent.”Kobayashi, who works in the village office, was instrumental in rounding up the 11 models and says he encountered surprisingly little resistance. “There are very few opportunities to meet young women here – and I speak from experience,” he says.Kobayashi and the other calendar models are reluctant, though, to go through the upheaval required to take their search farther afield. He partly attributes that to a “village mentality”, but says there are clear advantages to life in this unspoiled corner of northwest Nagano prefecture.“I went to university in Tokyo and I would get stressed out just taking the subway in the morning,” he says. “Here it’s a totally stress-free existence.”The calendar lists the models’ professions and hobbies, and a few words about their goals in life and their ideal partner. To date, the village office has received enquiries from eight women, four of whom have followed up by sending in their photographs and profiles.While Japan has seen a slight rise in the fertility rate in recent years, government incentives such as one-time cash payouts have had limited impact. In Otari, parents with bigger families receive one-off payments that rise with each child, as well as discounts on education fees. But the return has been minimal.“We don’t have a silver bullet for depopulation,” the mayor, Hisashi Matsumoto, conceded. “The population will probably continue to fall, but if we can persuade more families to have, say, three children, then we can at least slow down the rate of decline. “At the very least I want the people who already live here to lead as happy and healthy lives as possible. The same goes for anyone who decides to move here.”Daniel Hunter, a 21-year-old Australian who is in the middle of a plastering and tiling apprenticeship, has fallen for Otari since his first visit to the area a few years ago. He is single and wouldn’t mind having a girlfriend, but sees the calendar as more of a PR opportunity for the village than a personal plea for companionship.“I thought it was a cool opportunity to show people that there are foreigners living happily here,” says Hunter, whose parents spend every winter running a ski lodge nearby. “I can see myself sticking around for a while, although there are times when I wish it was a bit livelier.”No one in Otari expects the calendar to spark an influx of young women and a localised baby boom. But Fujiwara, who doubles as Mr May, hopes it will get people talking about the village.“I’m part of a family business so I will be here for the foreseeable future,” he says. . “In any case, moving to a place where there are more women would mean there are also more men, who would be my rivals.”At 26, Kobayashi is not fretting about marriage just yet. But he is typical of many Otari men who must reconcile their determination to stay put with a desire to find a life partner. “The thought of leaving the village has never crossed my mind,” he says. “But I don’t want to stay single either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c947c5ef54aff873e412ab713253b9c763c5b8/0_167_2800_1679/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103a6401acf4e68e83b500caa0fb622c","title":"north koreas top three military officials sacked as nuclear summit nears","story":"US officials believe there was dissent over Kim Jong-un’s approach to foreign diplomacyNorth Korea’s top three military officials have been removed from their posts, a senior US official said on Sunday, a shakeup that could signal the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, is working to silence dissent ahead of a summit with Donald Trump in Singapore next week. The US official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, was commenting on a report by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency that all three of the North’s top military officials were believed to have been replaced. Trump on Friday revived the proposed 12 June summit after cancelling it a week earlier. The US is seeking a negotiated end to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. US officials believe there was some dissent in the military about Kim’s approaches to South Korea and the US. Kim likely wants to ensure any deal struck in his meeting with Trump will not face opposition at home. Since coming to power in 2011, Kim has conducted several purges in an effort to consolidate power. The young leader was just 27 years old when he took power in a society that reveres older cadres. Kim had his uncle and potential rival for control, Jang Song-thaek, tried and executed in 2013. Kim’s older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was assassinated last year in an operation widely believed to have been directed from Pyongyang. The US official did not identify the three military officials. Yonhap identified them as defence chief Pak Yong-sik chief of the Korean People’s Army’s (KPA) general staff, Ri Myong-su and Kim Jong-gak, the director of the KPA’s General Political Bureau.Trump wants North Korea to “denuclearise,” meaning to get rid of its nuclear arsenal, in return for relief from economic sanctions. North Korea’s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival. Citing an unnamed intelligence official, Yonhap said No Kwang-chol, first vice minister of the Ministry of People’s armed forces, had replaced Pak Yong-sik, while Ri Myong-su was replaced by his deputy, Ri Yong-gil. It said army general Kim Su-gil’s replacement of Kim Jong-gak was confirmed in a North Korean state media report last month. The White House, State Department, CIA and Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for official comment. Lower-level US-North Korean talks to prepare for the summit are continuing but have made only “halting progress,” according to a second US official briefed on the discussions. That official said US negotiators’ efforts to press for definitions of immediate, comprehensive, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea had run into opposition from the White House. In a remarkable shift in tone eight days after cancelling the summit, citing Pyongyang’s “open hostility,” Trump welcomed North Korea’s former intelligence chief Kim Yong-chol to the White House on Friday, afterward exchanging smiles and handshakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e27b9d79f11f7a7ae6449c828e2bde58dd4fb16/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7cce2145351e84fc07a422a676d8ec","title":"sao paulos gay pride parade in pictures","story":"Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered in Brazil’s largest city for its 22nd annual celebration.

Photograph: Eric Luke The National Transport Authority (NTA) has shelved plans to close Dublin’s Merrion Gates level crossing to traffic and build a flyover between Strand Road and Merrion Road in Dublin 4, following huge local opposition. However, the authority has warned that traffic congestion at Merrion Gates is likely to worsen and a solution will have to be found in the future. It is also developing a new off-road cycle route, likely to involve property acquisition at Seapoint.In October 2016, the NTA published plans to tackle lengthy tailbacks on the Merrion Road and Rock Road caused by the funnelling of traffic through Merrion Gates into the narrow Strand Road towards Ringsend.The plan proposed the closure of the level crossing, with traffic erted on to a new flyover road over the rail line further north through the car parks of Merrion Hall on Strand Road and Our Lady Queen of Peace church on Merrion Road.The project would also facilitate the extension of the Dublin Bay cycle path – a continuous coastal route from Sutton to Sandycove, known as the S2S – to the south side, by digging an underpass at the level crossing for use by cyclists and pedestrians.The scheme would require the widening of Merrion Road and Rock Road with the acquisition of 35 properties, mostly front gardens, but a small number of houses and other buildings.By January 2017, the NTA had received 680 submissions, almost half of which opposed the construction of the traffic flyover.However, the NTA said it had been unable to come up with an alternative scheme because of EU protections on the seafront.“Other than closing Merrion Gates without providing a replacement road link, we have not identified a viable alternative scheme that complies with current environmental law.”Having identified no alternative, the NTA has now decided to shelve the scheme. “However, this means that the issue of the reduced time that will be available for traffic and other road users at the Merrion Gates level crossing as the frequency of Dart services increases, is not addressed, and will need to be addressed at a future date,” it said.The NTA said it would proceed with the section of the cycle route south of Merrion Gates to Seapoint, but would not turn Seapoint Avenue into a one-way street as previously planned, a measure which had been opposed by one-in-five submissions.Instead it proposes to build a cycling and pedestrian bridge over the Dart line at Idrone Terrace to allow the cycle route to run between the sea wall and the Dart line. The route will then travel around the perimeter of Maretimo headland and then onto an elevated boardwalk from Maretimo to Seapoint.While planning for this new proposal is in its early stages, “property acquisition is likely at Seapoint”, the NTA said.It said it would also fund the Dublin city end of the cycle path from Sean Moore Park in Irishtown along the coast to Merrion Gates.

Photograph: Katie CollinsPA WireIreland has just two full-time specialist psychiatrists for every woman in Ireland who is either expecting a baby or who has recently given birth. An official report last year demanded that seven be employed country-wide. The HSE’s own policy states that there should also be 10 specialist mental health nurses in maternity hospitals across the State, but it has confirmed there are only two.More than 12,000 women require mental healthcare before or after having a baby every year, based on a typical 64,000 births a year. James Browne, Fianna Fáil’s mental health spokesman, said the “atrocious” lack of perinatal care feeds into a narrative of revelations from the recent referendum on the Eighth Amendment to the cervical cancer scandal and the adoptions controversy. “Only two consultants in place, only two nurses, for the entire population of women who are pregnant or who have given birth – it is an absolutely stark figure. Effectively, the service doesn’t exist outside of Dublin. Someone in Cork or Galway who needs that support, it simply is not there. In 2018 it is unacceptable.”Mr Browne said any expecting or new mothers with mental health issues “need very particular support and care, and clearly they are not getting it. They can’t be with that number.”Perinatal mental health disorders, which complicate pregnancy and the first year after the birth, are regarded as unique in their potential to affect the relationship between mother, child and family, with subsequent consequences. It is estimated between 6,400 and 9,600 women in Ireland every year are likely to suffer mild to moderate depression while pregnant or after giving birth. Up to 2,240 may suffer more serious mental illness. Around 130 are likely to suffer from a postpartum psychosis, and the same number again are likely to suffer from other serious or complex disorders. The risk of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) after emergency Caesarean section – the prevalence of which is increasing – mean the overall figures “are likely to be an underestimate”, according to the HSE’s own report on perinatal mental health. Launched last November, it states there should be seven full-time perinatal psychiatrists and 10 designated mental health nurses. Prof Anthony McCarthy, one of Ireland’s two full-time consultant perinatal psychiatrists, based in the National Maternity Hospital, said the HSE was moving in the right direction. “We are coming from a stark history, we’re coming from a stark background. But we finally have some movement. The history of how Ireland has treated women in pregnancy plus how Ireland has put such a low priority on mental health – put the two together and it is not surprising that perinatal mental health is a way behind.”The other full-time psychiatrist is based at University Maternity Hospital Limerick. The HSE said it was currently “in process of approval” for a full-time consultant post for the Coombe, which already has a part-time posting, and for a part-time consultant at the Rotunda, both in Dublin. Approval has been granted for a consultant psychiatrist at both Galway University Hospital and Cork University Hospital. Another two part-time posts “are currently at various stages in the recruitment process”, while plans are in place for four mental health midwives for the National Maternity Hospital, and Kilkenny, Mullingar and Wexford hospitals.

Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market, which, of course, is Great Britain.”  Photograph: PA WireDemocratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has threatened to pull her support from Theresa May’s government if London agrees a plan that gives Northern Ireland special joint EUUK status.Ms Foster rejected the latest idea floated by the UK government to avoid a hard border on the island post-Brexit and break the impasse in negotiations between the EU and the UK.Speaking to Sky News, the DUP leader, whose party keeps Ms May’s Conservative Party in power at Westminster, said she would withdraw her support if Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Ms Foster said maintaining alignment between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was a “red line” that if crossed would result in Ms May losing the support of the 10 DUP MPs in the House of Commons.“For us our only red line is that we are not treated any different from the rest of the United Kingdom, that there are no trade barriers put up between Northern Ireland and our biggest market, which, of course, is Great Britain.“That’s what we will judge all of the propositions that are brought forward, we will judge it against that red line, and she’s very much aware of that, and I have confidence that she knows that she cannot bring forward anything that will breach that red line or we simply will not be able to support them.On Friday, it was reported that the UK’s Brexit secretary David Davis was creating a plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and EU status so it could trade freely with both and set up a “special economic zone” of 10 miles (16km) along the Border to eliminate the need for checkpoints.The idea has been dubbed Mr Davis’s “max fac 2” – an advanced version of his “maximum facilitation” or “max fac” solution relying on technological solutions to maintain an invisible border on the island.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator in the Brexit talks, has rejected this plan, and the option of a customs partnership proposed by London as neither operational or acceptable to Brussels.Failure to find a solution to avoid a hard border jeopardises negotiations to secure a deal ahead of the UK’s formal departure from the EU next March, and raises the prospect of a disorderly Brexit.Britain would experience shortages of medicine, fuel and food within a fortnight without a deal under a “Doomsday Brexit scenario” drawn up by senior civil services for Mr Davis, the Sunday Times reported.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said the British people should be allowed to vote again on Brexit if there was a risk of such a “nightmare” scenario materialising, something he described “as a treasonous act”.“If the no-deal scenario materialises, we owe to our friends in the UK to support a referendum which would allow the UK to reverse the previous referendum result,” he said.Negotiations are entering a critical period as Dublin and Brussels have urged London to show substantial progress on Border proposals by the next European Council meeting of EU leaders at the end of the month.Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said Mr Barnier’s EU taskforce must receive detailed proposals in writing from the British government within a fortnight if they are to be agreed at the June 28th-29th council.On Friday, in response to Mr Davis’s reported “max fac 2” plan, Mr Coveney’s department called on the British to engage “in a more detailed way” on other solutions and a legal text on the “backstop” option that would effectively keep Northern Ireland under EU economic rules if there is no other plan for the Border.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement

health funding","story":"The State has warned that a successful legal action by hospital consultants over withheld pay increases could have “catastrophic consequences” for health services funding.Consultants have challenged the withholding of agreed pay increases in 2009, and the State is contesting their claims.The HSE had previously forecast that in a worst-case scenario, about 2,000 consultants could have to be reimbursed, at an ultimate cost of about €700 million gross.In High Court affidavits on behalf of Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and others in defence of the cases, it is claimed 700 other consultants have identical claims, and that there are a further 2,280 on the same contract who may also be affected.The cases – 10 of which are due to be taken this week – are being defended by Mr Donohoe, as both Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Minister for Health Simon Harris, the HSE and inidual hospitals.Paying all these claims would be “beyond the means and normal budgetary management” and would have “catastrophic consequences for service delivery”, their affidavits argue.It is understood there has been significant contact between the two sides in the dispute in recent weeks and that this week’s hearing may be adjourned to allow for further talks with a view to a possible settlement.However, any settlement is still likely to cost the State hundreds of millions of euros.Under a contract introduced in 2008, consultants agreed to major work-practice changes, including the restriction – and in some cases, the elimination – of private practice, weekend working and extended rosters. In return, then minister for health Mary Harney offered them salaries of between €170,000 and €240,000, with increases to bring the rate up to these levels to be paid on a phased basis.The first payment was made, but not the second phase, following the collapse in the public finances, and the State later cut consultants’ pay by 15-25 per cent.The affidavits on behalf of the State say the “economic, fiscal and banking” circumstances at the time were of “unparalleled severity”.They also argue that the government of the day “made clear” in April 2009, including with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, that some pay increases “would not be sanctioned andor approved due to the serious disturbance in the economy and a decline in the economic circumstances of the State that had occurred”.“In circumstances where there are approximately 700 other plaintiffs seeking identical relief to the plaintiff and a further 2,280 consultants on the 2008 contract, if the relief sought is granted the liability accruing is wholly beyond the means and normal budgetary management.“In the circumstances it would be contrary to public policy, to the administration of justice and to principles of good administration” if claimants were allowed pursue their cases “outside the time limits provided for judicial review”.The doctors are understood to argue they signed up to and operated the contract with the legitimate expectation its terms would be fulfilled. Other arguments understood to have been put forward by the consultants include an increase in the number of hours worked per week and how working arrangements, including in private practice, were affected. Mr Donohoe has previously said the Government would “vigorously defend” any legal actions by consultants.Mr Donohoe has declined to say how much the potential costs to the exchequer of settling or losing cases against a large number of consultants would be.

Photograph: iStockThe Government is preparing for a “worst-case scenario” of extradition arrangements with Britain breaking down entirely after its planned pull-out of the EU in less than a year’s time.And it fears a “very significant” deterioration of co-operation between Dublin and London, causing “immediate and serious problems” in dealing with criminals and terrorists if the UK also exits a handful of key EU-wide conventions.Under the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system, police in any EU country can ask its counterparts in another member state to arrest a criminal suspect and return them for prosecution.The process takes as little as 48 days to complete at present.Documents from the Department of Justice show assistant secretary James Martin, head of international policy, briefed staff that the “best-case scenario” for extradition post-Brexit is the transfer of accused criminals taking “four or five years”.“Worst-case scenario is that extradition breaks down,” Mr Martin told his international policy unit, records released under Freedom of Information show.“This is not an understatement. Before the EAW, there were a whole series of cases where people were not extradited to the UK because it was regarded as political or courts said a person would not get a fair trial.“There was practically no extradition between Spain and the UK.”Last week, a senior EU figure told journalists during a briefing in Brussels that Britain would not legally be able to continue in the EAW system after it leaves the bloc.Several appeals are already before the courts in both the UK and Ireland challenging extradition on the basis of Brexit.In a separate discussion on the matter, Mr Martin told criminal justice figures last October that the UK’s decision to exit the EU had “alarmed” his department.Notably, the UK’s insistence on ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will “pose serious and complex obstacles” to close co-operation between the two countries, he said.It could take between “10 to 15 years before new agreements enter into force”, he told a private meeting of the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, his speaking notes show.The figure is based on the length of time it took for Norway and Iceland to negotiate a “surrender agreement” with the EU, which remains subject to a political clause.The “fall-back situation is the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition,” which “has many flaws”, he said.In a heavily redacted release of the department’s official assessment of the impact of Brexit, it says there will be a “noticeable practical effect” on Ireland through more than 700 EU regulations, directives and other instruments .Some 86 were identified as needing immediate attention, but a handful – including the EAW, Mutual Legal Assistance, Europol and the Prum convention on cross-border co-operation on crime and terrorism – are deemed among the most important.“If the UK was to exit all these instruments, the level of criminal justice and police co-operation between Ireland and the UK would be adversely affected to a very significant degree for both ordinary crime and terrorism,” it states.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you.

Photograph: Stephen CrowleyThe New York TimesIt was a moment of peak Spock.Hours after the globe-rattling election of a man whom Barack Obama has total disdain for, a toon who would take a chain saw to the former president’s legacy on policy and decency, Obama sent a message to his adviser Ben Rhodes: “There are more stars in the sky than grains of sand on the earth.”Perhaps Obama should have used a different line with a celestial theme by Shakespeare: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”As president, Obama always found us wanting. We were constantly disappointing him. He would tell us the right thing to do and then sigh and purse his lips when his instructions were not followed.Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, Rhodes writes in his new book, The World as It Is, Obama asked his aides, “What if we were wrong?”But in his next breath, the president made it clear that what he meant was: What if we were wrong in being so right? What if we were too good for these people?”“Maybe we pushed too far,” the president continued. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”So really, he’s not acknowledging any flaws but simply wondering if we were even more benighted than he thought. He’s saying that, sadly, we were not enlightened enough for the momentous changes wrought by the smartest people in the world – or even evolved enough for the first African-American president.“Sometimes I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,” Obama mused to aides.We just weren’t ready for his amazing awesomeness.It is stunning to me, having been on the road with Barack Obama in the giddy, evanescent days of 2008, that he does not understand his own historic rise to power, how he defied impossible odds and gracefully leapt over obstacles.He did it by sparking hope in many Americans – after all the deceptions and squandered blood and money of the Bush-Cheney era – that he was going to give people a better future, something honest and cool and modern.But by the end of his second term, he had lost the narrative about lifting up people, about buoying them on economic issues and soothing their jitters about globalisation. They needed to know, what’s in it for them?He pushed aside his loyal vice president, who was considered an unguided missile, and backed a woman who had no economic message and who almost used the slogan, “Because It’s Her Turn”. Then he put his own reputation for rectitude at risk by pre-emptively exonerating Hillary Clinton on the email issue, infuriating federal agents who were still investigating the case.The hunger for revolutionary change, the fear that some people were being left behind in America and that no one in Washington cared, was an animating force at the boisterous rallies for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.Yet Obama, who had surfed a boisterous wave into the Oval, ignored the restiveness – here and around the world. He threw his weight behind the most status quo, elitist candidate.“I couldn’t shake the feeling that I should have seen it coming,” Rhodes writes about the “darkness” that enveloped him when he saw the electoral map turn red. “Because when you distilled it, stripped out the racism and misogyny, we’d run against Hillary eight years ago with the same message Trump had used: She’s part of a corrupt establishment that can’t be trusted to change.”Bad time to figure that out.Where were the next Barack Obamas? Obama had never been about party building. He was the man alone in the arena.Even though he could make magic – like the time he sang Amazing Grace at a funeral for black parishioners murdered by a white supremacist in South Carolina – Obama did not like persuading people to do what they didn’t want to do. And that is the definition of politics. He wanted them simply to do what he had ascertained to be right.President Obama could be deliberative, reticent and cautious to a fault, which spurred an appetite for a more impulsive, visceral, hurly-burly successor. He got tangled in a cat’s cradle on the twin FBI investigations into Hillary’s emails and Russian meddling in retrospect, he probably should have been more transparent about both.Rhodes says that weeks after the election, he warned Obama that a narrative was developing that they didn’t do enough about the Russians and fake news.“And do you think,” Obama replied, “that the type of people reading that stuff were going to listen to me?”Obama was well aware during the campaign that his chosen heir sometimes seemed to be phoning it in. Campaigning together in Charlotte, he was nonplused to find out that Hillary had quickly slipped out of a barbecue joint where they had stopped to get food and greet people, while the president was left on his own, shaking every hand.Afterward he told his aides: “Most of the folks in these places have been watching Fox News and think I’m the antichrist. But if you show up, shake their hand, and look them in the eye, it’s harder for them to turn you into a caricature. You might even pick up a few votes.”The Clinton campaign, Rhodes reports, asked Obama to go the day before the election to Pennsylvania and Michigan, a state he had won by 10 points in 2012.“Michigan,” Obama said in wonder. “That’s not good.” – New York Times "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen

method could help regenerate tooth enamel","story":"The discovery could help tackle tooth decayScientists say they have developed a material which could help regenerate tooth enamel - and prevent tooth decay or sensitivity in the future.Coating the outer part of the teeth, enamel is the hardest tissue in the body and can resist extreme temperatures and acidic food and drinks, helping it last for decades.Researchers at Queen Mary University of London now say they have developed a new way to grow mineralised material, which could pave the way for regenerating hard tissues such as enamel and bone.Dr Sherif Elsharkawy, a dentist and first author of the study, said: This is exciting because the simplicity and versatility of the mineralisation platform opens up opportunities to treat and regenerate dental tissues.How to | Brush your teeth betterFor example, we could develop acid-resistant bandages that can infiltrate, mineralise, and shield exposed dentinal tubules (microscopic channels) in human teeth for the treatment of hypersensitivity.The team found a protein that is able to trigger the growth of crystals, in a similar way to how crystals grow when dental enamel develops in the body.Dark chocolate, strawberries and sauerkraut: the surprising foods that will keep your teeth healthy and whiteLead author Professor Alvaro Mata said the key discovery had been finding a way to exploit proteins to control and guide the process of mineralisation.Through this, we have developed a technique to easily grow synthetic materials that emulate such hierarchically organised architecture over large areas and with the capacity to tune their properties, he added.The experts believe their work, published in science journal Nature Communications, has the potential to be used in a variety of ways in regenerative medicine.Please review our commenting policyGuatemala volcano eruption: Several dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through

fares could way","story":"Passengers who buy tickets on board could pay the same price as those who have booked months in advanceCheap advance rail fares could be phased out under radical industry plans to modernize the way people book train journeys.  The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, is calling for a digital overhaul of fares which could see passengers who buy tickets on board paying the same price as those who have booked months in advance. At present advance tickets costing as little as £15 are available for the same journeys for which last-minute tickets can cost hundreds of pounds. Under the plans, passengers will be given a national travel account letting them manage and book journeys with any rail provider through a single smartphone app. This could eventually be extended to buses and taxis, RDG said. Journeys booked through the app will be automatically allocated the lowest available fare, mitigating the need for so-called split-ticketing, where two separate tickets to a destination are cheaper than the cost of a single fare.  The change would be the biggest change to rail fares in a generationThe national travel accounts will also form a centralized database which allows firms to reward passengers with personalized loyalty discounts and promotions.The shakeup, set to be the biggest change to rail fares in a generation, is designed to stop passengers getting ripped of by confusing fares, as well as the need for so-called split-ticketing.Any measures will be designed to be revenue neutral with no change in average fares and no extra support from taxpayers. If more expensive fares were removed therefore, then cheaper fares would have to rise to ensure any changes remain neutral.It comes just weeks after the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, defended train companies that charge more than £300 for last minute fares. “It is no different on the railways to the airlines,” he said. “Walking up at the last minute on a principal business route will cost you a lot more than booking a month in advance.However consumer groups came out in support of ending advance tickets, arguing that the current system unfairly penalizes people who needed to make emergency journeys, for example to travel to friends or family in need.  Which are best: road trips or rail journeys?James Daley, director at consumer campaign group Fairer Finance, said: There will be winners and losers but the good thing is that it would stop really unfair outcomes. It don\u0027t think its right that someone who book two months in advance should get a super cheap ticket when someone who has no choice but to book last minute can pay hundreds of pounds. Last minute tickets are also where a lot of the rip-offs happen as people choose the wrong tickets at machines.The RDG\u0027s consultation, which launches on Monday, will propose a range of other ideas for simplifying train fares, including calculating prices based on the level of service received and scrapping peak time premiums.However, Andy Wakeford, head of fares at the Rail Delivery Group, said he thought these suggestions were unlikely to be implementedTransport and industryGuatemala volcano

rusbridger former guardian editor bid bring","story":"Malala Yousafzai at her Oxford University matriculation ceremony last yearShe has become a household name as a global campaigner for human rights and women’s education, and became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate aged just 17. Now she has turned her advocacy skills to take on Alan Rusbridger, the former  editor, in her attempt to bring back parties at her Oxford University college, after they were banned by the governing body of Lady Margaret Hall, which Rusbridger chairs, in April.Ms Yousafzai was voted in as one of the college’s social secretaries, and vowed in her manifesto to bring back ‘bops’ - college parties with cheap alcohol and fancy dress themes. The college bops were clamped down on after a student came dressed as Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer accused of rape and sexual harassment.On a visit to her hometown in March, Ms Yousafzai revealed she would return to Pakistan after finishing her studies in OxfordAnother was disciplined after he came to a “dress as your degree” themed party as Stephen Hawking, in a costume including an office chair with wheels. In an email to students, the college said that there was “a problem within college around responsible drinking and party behaviour”, and banned college parties indefinitely, Cherwell reported.The email was sent by the college’s deans, who are in charge of discipline and were acting on the decision of the governing body, made up of college tutors and senior officials.Oxford Student Union has published extensive guidance on bop themes, advising against those which “intentionally cause offence”, “encourage the mocking of gender presentation” or have “culturally appropriative themes”.But running in a college election with fellow student Tiger Akawin, Ms Yousafzai pledged to bring bops back at LMH by overturning the ruling of the college authorities.The duo promised ‘Bop Liquer’ and ‘Bop Pizza’ for future parties, which usually take place in the college and with a student DJ.Ms Yousafzai, who does not drink alcohol, also called for events for people “who aren’t keen on alcohol, crowds of people or loud music”.Alan Rusbridger, former Editor of the , is Principal of Lady Margaret HallShe has not yet begun her new role, but is expected to organise the college social calendar from the beginning of October. After tweeting about her place at Oxford on A-level results day, Ms Yousafzai received a reply from LMH Principal Alan Rusbridger, welcoming her to the college. Since beginning her studies in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 2017, she has been active in university life, taking the role of spokesperson at the Pakistani Society and joining the Oxford Union. Last month, she attracted attention after paying £400 in a student charity auction to slap the college’s Charity Rep, a video of which appeared online.In March, she returned to her hometown in the Swat Valley in Pakistan for the first time since she was shot there by the Taliban in 2012. Speaking to Pakistani media, she said that she intends to return to the country after finishing her studies in Oxford in two years’ time, and will continue campaigning for women’s education. University of OxfordGuatemala volcano eruption: Several dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through villagesBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, the

colleges admitted fewer ten black british students","story":"Cambridge University said that it cannot change ersity “on its own” Six of Cambridge University’s colleges admitted fewer than ten black British students in five years, and some admitted none at all in some years, new data has shown.The data, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Financial Times, comes after the revelation last month that one in four Oxford colleges did not admit a single black British student between 2015 and 2017. Cambridge University said that it cannot change ersity “on its own” and called for parents and schools to help boost the number of underrepresented minorities applying to its colleges.St Edmund’s College, Cambridge, did not admit any black British students between 2012 and 2016, despite receiving between 31 and 35 applications.Magdalene College, which was the last Oxbridge college to admit women in 1988, received 40 applications from black British students but only made between three and nine offers. Downing College received 37 applications from black British students between 2014 and 2015 but made no offers.Fitzwilliam College was the only college to consistently make more than four offers to black British students in the 2012 to 2016 period.The figures were released by the University as ranges, because the small numbers involved meant that the anonymity of applicants could have been compromised. “We are already doing a significant bit of outreach, but ultimately the university isn’t going to be able to bring about this change on its own. We need the support of schools and parents too,” the university told the Financial Times.“More needs to be done to prepare high-achieving black students for applications to Cambridge and Oxford, which is why we have significantly increased the funding we contribute to programmes like Target Oxbridge,” it added.David Lammy campaignd on ersity at Oxford David Lammy, MP for Tottenham, who campaigns for ersity in British universities, said: “Cambridge, and every university in the country, should be publishing all their access and admissions data every year”.“We need transparency if we are going to have progress on access to our elite institutions for students from disadvantaged and under-represented backgrounds,” he said.Last month, his information requests showed the lack of black British students at Oxford colleges. Mr Lammy also spoke out against the opacity of universities in not revealing data.“The fact that many colleges are admitting so few black British students that they argue that publishing the information would risk identifying inidual students is itself the strongest possible evidence that there is so much work to do,” he added.Guatemala volcano eruption: Several dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through villagesBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, the final: A worthy winner crowned as Rev Michael Curry gives his blessingMI5 will reveal the identity of terror suspects to police officers and teachers to help disrupt plotsAll 10 series of Doctor Who since 2005 revival arrive on BBC iPlayerLazy cooks are more likely to get breast cancer Learner car boxes can\u0026#39t withstand high speeds, report warns as learner drivers take to the motorwaysBritain faces \u0026#39full spectrum\u0026#39 of Russian threat for \u0026#39years to come\u0026#39, MP\u0026#39s report says Grenfell \u0026#39disaster tourists\u0026#39 flocked to site to \u0026#39take selfies\u0026#39, report finds Cheap advance rail fares could be on the way out Anti-immigrant party wins isive Slovenian election as coalition talks set to beginVictims of London Bridge terror attack are remembered in memorial serviceMarian Keyes accuses book prize of sexism after never being shortlisted in 18 yearsAlastair Campbell given a dressing down live on radio by his daughter over his feminism credentialsBBC pays lip service to mothers in work, says Alex Jones after breast-feeding struggleMalala takes on Alan Rusbridger, the former  editor, in a bid to bring back parties at her Oxford collegeThe Crown stardust adds lustre to medals put up for sale by the family of Queen\u0026#39s \u0026#39favourite\u0026#39 aideA Very English Scandal, episode 3, review: Hugh Grant completes transformation from romantic lead to hypocritical rotter in finale of the Jeremy Thorpe affairExclusive: Theresa May expected to lift visa cap for doctors from outside the EU within weeksSex assault victims will be offered a lifetime of counselling under new NHS pledge Comment: We should expand Heathrow, but not via this monopolistic, risky and expensive schemeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"uk sends strongest signals free navigation south china sea","story":"Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, said on Sunday that the UK has deployed three ships to the Asia-Pacific this year to send the “strongest of signals” on the importance of freedom of navigation and to keep up maximum pressure on North Korea.  His comments on board the Royal Navy’s HMS Sutherland docked in Singapore, come a day after General James Mattis, the US Secretary of Defence, accused China of “intimidation and coercion” in the South China Sea and warned there would be “consequences” if it continued. The surge of British warships, which include the Sutherland - an anti-submarine frigate - the HMS Albion and HMS Argyll, is the first deployment of three vessels to the region in a generation. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, on board the HMS Sutherland in Singapore Part of their mission is to conduct freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea, where Beijing is continuing to alarm the international community with a build up of military fortifications in disputed waters. “The reason that they are here and the reason that we are visiting is to send the strongest of signals. We believe that countries should play by the rules,” said Mr Williamson. “This is even more important at a time when storm clouds are gathering and regional fears are rising, when more nations have nuclear and chemical weapons, not to mention the infringement of regional access, freedoms and security.”But he declined to answer whether British ships would sail within 12 nautical miles of a disputed territory or artificial island built by the Chinese, as US ships have done. At the end of May China’s military said it had dispatched warships to challenge two US Navy vessels that had passed within 12 nautical miles of the Paracel Islands, an archipelago in disputed waters off the coast of Vietnam. Gavin Williamson, UK defence secretary, tours the HMS Sutherland in SingaporeChina, whose claim to the Paracel Islands is not recognised, argued that passage within 12 nautical miles constitutes a violation of the country’s territory under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Mr Williamson stressed that the UK, France and Australia had also been asserting their rights of passage in the region. “We’ve been sending a clear message to all that the freedom of navigation is absolutely critical,” he said. Since it left UK shores in January, the Sutherland and its 220-strong crew have also engaged in surveillance operations to counter efforts by North Korea to bypass UN sanctions on banned commodities through illicit ship-to-ship transfers. Mr Williamson said the UK was “very realistic about the challenges” that lay ahead with North Korea, but welcomed the prospect of the upcoming Singapore summit between Donald Trump, the US President and Kim Jong-un. “The most important thing that we have is the fact that people are talking, people are trying to work to find a solution and the diplomatic lead that has been shown is one that I think we all welcome and we know is the right approach.”    Please review our commenting policyGuatemala volcano eruption: Several dead and hundreds injured as lava river sweeps through villagesBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, the final: A worthy winner crowned as Rev Michael Curry gives his blessingMI5 will reveal the identity of terror suspects to police officers and teachers to help disrupt plotsAll 10 series of Doctor Who since 2005 revival arrive on BBC iPlayerLazy cooks are more likely to get breast cancer Grenfell \u0026#39disaster tourists\u0026#39 flocked to site to \u0026#39take selfies\u0026#39, report finds Learner car boxes can\u0026#39t withstand high speeds, report warns as learner drivers take to the motorwaysBritain faces \u0026#39full spectrum\u0026#39 of Russian threat for \u0026#39years to come\u0026#39, MP\u0026#39s report says Cheap advance rail fares could be on the way out Anti-immigrant party wins isive Slovenian election as coalition talks set to beginSix Cambridge colleges admitted fewer than ten black British students in five yearsVictims of London Bridge terror attack are remembered in memorial serviceMarian Keyes accuses book prize of sexism after never being shortlisted in 18 yearsAlastair Campbell given a dressing down live on radio by his daughter over his feminism credentialsBBC pays lip service to mothers in work, says Alex Jones after breast-feeding struggleExclusive: Theresa May expected to lift visa cap for doctors from outside the EU within weeksMalala takes on Alan Rusbridger, the former  editor, in a bid to bring back parties at her Oxford collegeThe Crown stardust adds lustre to medals put up for sale by the family of Queen\u0026#39s \u0026#39favourite\u0026#39 aideA Very English Scandal, episode 3, review: Hugh Grant completes transformation from romantic lead to hypocritical rotter in finale of the Jeremy Thorpe affairSex assault victims will be offered a lifetime of counselling under new NHS pledge We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"cultural appropriation term prom dress political correctness blackface performance costume","story":"Music, fashion, even food...\u0026nbsphave all\u0026nbspfallen foul of causing offence. Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it.\u0026nbspEven Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Fashion is, of course, a highly sensitive area for cultural appropriation. The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.And I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War\u0026nbsp(though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since 1816 they have been housed in the British Museum.Their status has long been hotly disputed. Greece, which for decades has called for their return, with several formal requests, has also in the past threatened legal action and proposed solutions such as mediation by Unesco.Lord Elgin insisted he had permission to take the sculptures, saying he had the permission of officials of the ruling Ottoman empire, and that he was worried about their being damaged.Opponents of their removal from London say that the move would pave the way for requests from other countries for artworks in British museums to returned.Supporters of the Greek position argue that the Ottoman authorities were a foreign force and had no right to let the artefacts go.Ta Nea reported: “In the exclusive interview given to Nea, Jeremy Corbyn agrees that, if elected, he will begin the return of the Parthenon sculptures to our country.”Mr Corbyn reportedly said: “They were made in Greece and have been there for many centuries until Lord Elgin took them.“As with anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession – including artefacts looted from other countries in the past – we should be engaged in constructive talks with the Greek government about returning the sculptures.”Mr Corbyn has long been a supporter of the marbles’ repatriation but this is the first time as party leader that he has made his intent so clear.The UK government’s position is that the ownership of the sculptures is a matter for the trustees of the British Museum, according to a House of Commons briefing paper.The British Museum website says: “The Acropolis Museum allows the Parthenon sculptures that are in Athens to be appreciated against the backdrop of ancient Greek and Athenian history. This display does not alter the trustees’ view that the sculptures are part of everyone’s shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries. The trustees remain convinced that the current ision allows different and complementary stories to be told about the surviving sculptures.”It says the British Museum Act 1963 bans the trustees from permanently disposing of objects unless they are duplicates of others already in the collection or are “unfit to be retained ... and can be disposed of without detriment to the interests of students”.A Labour spokesperson said Mr Corbyn was stating his long-standing personal view and that he was right to call for constructive talks.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Davis’s idea was dubbed “max fac 2”.But Brussels has already rejected both schemes, with chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier saying on Friday that neither was “operational or acceptable”.EU leaders including\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach,\u0026nbsphave called for progress by the time the European Council meets at the end of June, with Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy head of government,\u0026nbspon Saturday also telling The  the UK must produce “written proposals” for the border within the next two weeks.Sajid Javid, the home secretary,\u0026nbspsaid on Sunday that the government was making progress with Brexit plans, saying: “I’m confident that as we get to the June council meeting, the prime minister will have a good set of proposals and our colleagues in Europe will respond positively.”But shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said the government’s refusal to remain in a customs union with the European Union would ensure the UK was a “minnow trying to compete against whales” on the global stage.He told Sky News that Labour’s Brexit policy would ensure “trade in goods would continue uninterrupted”, adding: “The Tories’ red line is actually going to make it much, much more difficult.“They’re the ones who will be isolated, they will be minnows trying to compete against whales.“They will be a 70 million strong consumer market against America’s 500 million.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The approach on services therefore should be about managing ergence.”Ministers are under pressure to come up with some commonly agreed proposals that are acceptable to Brussels by the European Council summit meeting towards the end of the month.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In most circumstances, if\u0026nbspone dies, quits or\u0026nbspretires then the successor is voted for by members of their own party.Analysis by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) found that the average electorate for normal hereditary by-election\u0026nbspis only 32 voters, with only 29 people usually turning out.The group\u0026nbspfound that four by-elections had more candidates than electors in recent years – including a by-election for Labour hereditary peers with\u0026nbsp11 candidates and only three voters.Some 3,190 votes have been cast in the last 32 by-elections, which began in 2003, compared to the last 32 Commons by-elections, where 931,725 votes have been cast.ERS chief executive\u0026nbspDarren Hughes\u0026nbspsaid: “These so-called by-elections are an undemocratic farce – and make mockery of our democracy.“This time, around 25 peers are set to decide which aristocrat remains in parliament to vote on our laws, for the rest of their lives. “That is not democracy – and it’s time we ended this bizarre hangover from feudal times. \u0026nbsp“It’s vital for trust and faith in our democracy that the forthcoming farce of a by-election – brought about by the retirement of Earl Baldwin of Bewdley – will be the last. “The public should decide who votes on our laws – not a tiny clique of aristocrats.”Labour peer Lord Grocott\u0026nbspis trying to axe the by-elections through a private members’ bill but his efforts were blocked by a handful of hereditary peers in March.However,\u0026nbspConservative frontbencher Lord Young of Cookham\u0026nbspsaid the government “will not obstruct” his bill and offered it more parliamentary time.Lord Grocott\u0026nbsptold The Independent:\u0026nbsp“These were only supposed to be a temporary measure but it’s now gone on for 19 years.“There have been 32 hereditary by-elections, so I mean that’s a third of all hereditary peers who have been replaced. It’s ridiculous.“You have this situation where the government is trying to reduce the size of the Lords and the House of Commons but you have 92 peers who cannot be touched.”Only one woman is eligible to stand in the upcoming by-election out of more than 200 candidates, and just 31 peers will be able to vote, according to a written parliamentary question to Lord Grocott.The poll will also cost taxpayers more than £1,140 to stage.Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the issue was “another reminder of how archaic, undemocratic and outdated” the Lords is.“Liberal Democrats have long argued for an elected upper chamber, but sadly attempts to introduce reform were thwarted by the self-interest of the other two parties,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Isn’t it ironic, however, that murmurs from the Tories have changed in recent weeks as a result of the Lords defeating them on the EU Withdrawal Bill on fifteen occasions?”Lord Fowler, the Lords speaker, has welcomed efforts to slash the size of the upper chamber\u0026nbspafter a key Lords committee\u0026nbsprecommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in numbers.\u0026nbspA Lords spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The House of Lords recognises the need for reform and, following a report from the Lord Speaker’s committee on the size of the house in October 2017, showed overwhelming\u0026nbspsupport for reducing and capping the size of the house, and for linking new appointments to general election results.”It comes after\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspaccused of\u0026nbsp“hypocrisy” after appointing nine new Tory peers to the House of Lords, including several ex-ministers, despite promising that senior politicians would not receive automatic ennoblement.Her announcement coincided with the eve of the royal wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, prompting claims that the prime minister had tried to\u0026nbspsneak out the news when it would receive little attention.Candidates for the upcoming by-election will be announced on 15 June, with the count on 4 July.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Refusing to review it when the country nears full employment and sectors are reporting skills shortages is quite another.”The Independent, along with the Open Britain group,\u0026nbsphas been running the Drop the Target campaign to scrap the “tens of thousands” net migration policy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It says the programme is carried out in accordance with the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling.“Whales are already facing substantial threats including bycatch in fisheries and marine pollution,” Ms Wellbelove said. ”Significant conservation efforts are underway worldwide to address these issues, so the least Japan could do is put away the harpoons.“The continued killing of any whales is abhorrent to modern society, but these new figures make it even more shocking. We look forward to Australia and other pro-conservation countries sending the strongest possible message to Japan that it should stop its lethal whaling programme.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/nintchdbpict000408650359.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the sun newspaper summer internship scheme","story":"We are looking for the next generation of reporters, editors, photographers, social media stars and graphic designers to join Britain’s number one newspaper – in print and online.The deadline for applications is 9am on Monday, June 4.The internships will last eight-to-12 weeks and start on July 2.Unlike Labour MP Chuka Umunna, under fire for failing to pay his interns, we will be paying the full London Living Wage.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It had all these weird side effects,” Jeppesen says.“There were moments when I finally was alone and nobody was watching me, yet it felt creepy because I was so used to being watched.Also, even when you’re not being monitored, people are staring because I’m a white guy and they’re not used to seeing foreigners in North Korea.”On his first morning, he heard an eerie sound outside his hotel room at 5 a.m., then heard it again every day after that.The entire city, it turns out, is awakened by an instrumental version of the North Korean tune, “Where Are You, Dear General?” a salute to the countrys founder Kim Il-sung.“It’s very, very haunting, and very bizarre,” Jeppesen said.“It almost sounds like something out of a David Lynch movie. It’s one of the things that reminds you that Dear Leader is with you everywhere you go. At every moment.”What North Koreans didn’t have at every moment was electricity, which Jeppesen’s prestigious university was usually without.“The hallways were dark. There was no plumbing really in the bathrooms,” he says.“It hit home that this is a really poor third-world country. Everything is very bare-bones.”Every housing unit came with one official spy — usually a middle-aged or elderly woman — called the inminbanjang, whose job is to know everything about her residents and report back to the government.“Her job is to ‘heighten revolutionary vigilance,’ as one propaganda poster has it,” Jeppesen writes in the book.“[She keeps] a watchful eye over the comings and goings of her assigned unit, down to the smallest detail. A good inminbanjang knows exactly how many spoons and chopsticks are in each family’s kitchen and can spill that information on cue if the need should arise.Which is not to say the inminbanjang are always strict. Many let certain rules slide, such as the elderly woman Jeppesen met who was “known to rent out her second room as an hourly love hotel for extra income.”This is just one example of how life is becoming slightly less regimented for North Koreans.While virtually all citizens wore uniforms until recently, there is now a freer sense of fashion. Men wear “short-sleeve shirts of all colors and designs,” with Rolexes adorning their wrists for status (even if most are fakes from China).Women mostly wear skirts, although jeans are permitted for some in certain positions.

Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash. There would be a stampede to stop Mrs May reaching the exit.Now it seems most if not all those casualties could have escaped if they had not been penned in their flats by fire-brigade diktat.We raise our hats to the fire service teams who risked death in this hideous blaze.

I know from day one what terror attacks do to the emergency services. An incredible amount of work goes into preparing for multiple casualties. And the emergency services themselves can be very nervous. It’s a very daunting time. But without fail, our emergency services step up. It was no different during the London Bridge attack. The policemen who answered - within minutes - the first call had no idea what they were going into. It’s times like that you really do see the best of our services. We must never take for granted the sacrifices they make.  Each time there is a terror attack or a tragedy like Grenfell, we see our emergency services doing us proud. You see off-duty medics, police, firefighters coming in to help their teams. And that’s to save as many lives as possible. I worked with Dr Martin Griffiths when I was at the Royal London and he’s a great example of this. Martin was off duty when the London Bridge call came in. He made his way there as soon as he heard the news. It’s so important that people like Martin are recognised for their work. And it was great he won an award at the NHS Heroes event, where he said he wasn’t the only one who should be thanked, There are all the unsung heroes as well. The nurses and paramedics who worked double shifts. The hospital receptionists who dealt with worried relatives.

He said that he regarded the phrase as a negative term, a non-British term and said there were lessons to be learned from the controversy, in which Britons were wrongly expatriated to Caribbean nations.  Mr Javid, who replaced Amber Rudd after she resigned at the end of April, said he wanted to replace the hostile environment with a compliant environment that distinguishes between illegal and legal immigrants.  He told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show: I\u0027m going to look at how it\u0027s been implemented. I want to review aspects of the policy. I\u0027ve already made some changes.  One of the changes is suspending the ban on illegal immigrants opening bank accounts, he said, saying the Home Office was not sure its data was accurate enough. He added: From Windrush, I think there will be lessons to learn about how that compliant environment policy is actually implemented. Is it working the way that it was intended? Mr Javid also said he would like to look again at the inclusion of foreign students in net immigration figures, saying it had a perception problem, but adding that it was not my most urgent priority. He also said he was taking a fresh look at the cap on tier 2 visas which allow non-EU foreign doctors to come to the UK.  Last week the The British Medical Journal said that between December 2017 and March 2018 more than 1,500 visa applications from doctors with job offers in the UK were refused as a result of the cap on workers from outside of the European Economic Area. Mr Javid told Marr: I see the problem with that and it is something that I\u0027m taking a fresh look at. I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this and that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m doing.  Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman Ed Davey said: The Home Secretary will have the support of almost everyone in Parliament to exclude students and medical staff from the immigration cap, but it\u0027s far from clear that the Prime Minister is willing to admit her long-cherished policy is wrong. I hope Parliament can get to vote on this as soon as possible. The \u0027Windrush generation\u0027 are British residents who arrived from Commonwealth countries before New Year\u0027s Day 1973. They are named after the Empire Windrush, the ship which brought some of the first Caribbean migrants to Britain in 1948. Anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 has a legal right to stay, unless they left the UK for more than two years. But they faced being threatened with deportation under new immigration rules despite living and working here for decades. People were ordered to prove they have the right to be in the UK to rent property, work or access services and benefits. The government failed to keep detailed records of Windrush arrivals, and landing cards were destroyed in 2010. The Home Office set up a task force with the aim of sorting out cases within two weeks. Windrush immigrants are also being granted fee-free citizenship and a compensation scheme, the rules of which have not been set yet.

Official figures requested by Tim Roache’s GMB union from the Office for National Statistics shine a public light on a dirty secret well-heeled, bad bosses and a Conservative Government want ignored: low wages, long hours and poor conditions are killers.

The ‘doomsday’ scenario was produced by civil servants for Brexit Secretary David Davis, according to the Sunday Times.  They’re understood to have imagined three scenarios for what could happen if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal - a mild one, a severe one - and one branded “armageddon.” Even the moderate case, they say, would see the port of Dover collapse on day one. The Times quote a source as saying: ”In the second scenario, not even the worst, the port of Dover will collapse on day one. The supermarkets in Cornwall and Scotland will run out of food within a couple of days, and hospitals will run out of medicines within two weeks.  The documents are thought to be so explosive they have only been shared with a handful of ministers, and have been “locked in a safe”. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union confirmed the discussions had taken place, but denied the doomsday scenario would come to pass. They told the Times: “A significant amount of work and decision-making has gone into our no-deal plans, especially where it relates to ports, and we know that none of this would come to pass. In February, before the report was produced, David Davis used a speech in Vienna to reassure Britain it would not be plunged into a “Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction” after we leave the EU. But the documents predict the severe scenario would see planes chartered to ferry supplies to the corners of the UK, and petrol running out by the end of the second week.  Brexiteer Tory Iain Dunan Smith accused the civil service of re-igniting project fear by setting out the dystopian nightmare. He said: “They should be planning for what happens if there is no deal, not scaring the pants off each other. We need people with imagination and courage, not frightened rabbits.” Best for Britain champion and Lib Dem MP Layla Moran demanded the government publish the papers.

Stretching lazily, Miss Kisses, Kitten’s pink dog, yawned. On Kitten’s pink bedside table, her pink phone sat beside her pink lamp. Sunshine was peeking through the pink curtains and as Kitten gazed across her pink room, she was in heaven.  Kitten’s pink pursuit began almost by accident 34 years ago. It was her 20th birthday and she was trying to work out what to wear to her party. She settled on a pink top, pink fluffy skirt, pink shoes and pink accessories.  I felt fabulous. I thought, if wearing that much pink could make me feel fantastic, why not wear pink every day? Going back to blue jeans and a white T-shirt seemed ludicrous to me. I didn’t want to wait until the next special occasion to feel pink-credible again. I wanted to feel and look pretty in pink every day. I sold my car so I had enough money to leave my hometown of Houston, Texas, and head for the bright pink lights of Hollywood, says Kitten.   I like to say I’m a flamingo in a world full of pigeons. When I walk down a busy street during the morning commute, everyone’s wearing grey and black. There’s no expression, no individuality. Yet people think I’m the crazy one! Over the years, Kitten estimates she has spent over one million pounds on pink paraphernalia and outfits.  That sounds like a lot, but if you break it down over the decades, it’s no more than anyone else is spending on cars, sofas and soft furnishings. The only difference is, for me every pound is spent on pink, she says.  From the moment you step over the threshold into her pink palace, everything is pink. Tickled pink From the front door to the TV to the loo roll, if it comes in pink you can bet your pink dollar I’ve got it. My hairbrush, my toothbrush, my kitchen utensils, you name it, it’s pink, enthuses Kitten.  My car is customised in pink, with pink chair covers and a pink gear stick. The number plate reads PINKEST, of course! Every item of clothing I own is a shade of pink. I have a pink whisk for when I bake pink cookies, a pink chair where I sit at my pink dressing table to apply my pink make-up. I have a pink throne and a pink crown bedazzled by pink jewels. I am the Queen of Pink, after all. I even use a safe, vet-approved, beetroot-based dye to colour my dog, Miss Kisses. I don’t have children but Miss Kisses is my baby, we go everywhere together. I have a recurring dream that I have a super power, where everything I touch turns pink, as if I’m magic, Kitten says.   It’s like the Midas touch but instead of everything turning gold like it does in the mythological story of the King of Phrygia, everything I touch turns a beautiful shade of my favourite colour. When I wake up, I can’t help smiling because I look around and think dreams do come true. Celebrities, including Paris Hilton and Carmen Electra, have flocked to Kitten’s home. But while most people find Kitten’s life entertaining, she is used to fending off criticism from those who think it’s all for show. Hollywood highlights  People think there must be days I’m feeling sad or just can’t be bothered to do the pink thing. They think sometimes I must just throw on a black tracksuit, but I say, \u0027Never!\u0027 It’s not for show, Kitten says.  Every day I wake up looking forward to the day. I couldn’t wake up in this pink world and feel anything but happy – it’s such a happy colour. It’s a privilege to run my hand over my rail of pink outfits and figure out what ensemble I’ll wear each day. I’m a fashionista and I make sure my outfit is well choreographed. Not every shade of pink complements every other shade of pink. My life is a carefully curated work of art.   Kitten has now made a name for herself as the Pink Lady of Hollywood. Every year, on America’s National Pink Day in June, Kitten is called upon as the world’s premier pink specialist.   When I pulled on that adorable pink outfit for my 20th birthday, I never could have imagined I could have a pink career but now, being pink is not only my passion, it’s put a pink roof over my head too, says Kitten. I earn money through my social media platforms. It still amazes me that a three-minute YouTube video can earn me money but that’s how the world works now. I’m an influencer – I didn’t even know that was a job but I’m just doing what I love and getting paid for it.  I also work as an actress and singer. My latest song, Queen Of Pink, has just been released. I’m a big fan of the Queen of England. She wears pink too. I would love the Queen of Pink to meet the Queen of England. We could swap fashion tips! Kitten’s Instagram page @kittenkaysera has over 70,000 followers and 52,000 people have subscribed to her YouTube channel. Videos chronicling Kitten’s pink life have been viewed millions of times – her fans are hooked on her every pink move.  Kitten even writes her emails in a pink font. She has several pink cases for her phone, pink sweets in jars on her pink kitchen surfaces, pink coats to go over pink tops. There are 30 pink sunglasses and lipstick in every shade of pink, to suit every pink mood she’s in.  There will always be haters. For some reason, people take offence when other people are too sure of themselves, too happy. I never let the trolls get to me. They’re just jealous that their life isn’t as colourful as mine, Kitten says.  I take their jibes with a pinch of pink salt. Seriously – even my salt is pink. It’s Himalayan rock salt, a beautiful, soft shade of pink. Kitten is single by choice but dates occasionally. Most men find her style fun but one gentleman came to Kitten’s house for dinner and didn’t comment on the extraordinary world he’d entered. After a while I had to ask him what he thought of all the pink and he looked at me blankly, before asking if I was wearing pink. He was colourblind! To him, my outfit and home seemed grey. He couldn’t appreciate it so I had to give him the pink slip, Kitten says. ‘I’m not looking for love and I wouldn’t want a man to wear pink for me but I can only ever imagine myself being with someone who sees the pink and loves me for it. A colourful life The evolution of Kitten’s taste has seen her go through soft pink and baby pink stages, but right now, she’s loving a neon vibe. The older I get, the hotter the shade of pink I am drawn to, Kitten says. I get sent pink gifts from fans all over the world and I can’t sell or give anything away. I rent a storage unit just to keep all my pink pieces. It used to be harder to find things in pink but these days there are 50 shades of pink for just about everything I could possibly need or want in life. I’m spoiled for choice.

Collette Lee, who was just 33 when she died last month, was engaged to marry her partner Sasha Ruan next year. But the much-loved manager at the Vanilla bar in Manchester was found dead on the morning of May 24. It is thought she died from hypoglycemic shock, when the blood sugar level suddenly crashes, during the night. Ruan, 31, said that the tragedy had left the life she had planned with Lee in tatters.  In the three years that we were together, Collette did so much for me, she told the Manchester Evening News .   I never would have got into the ambulance service without her support. I had my dream job, we got this house together, we had started the adoption process, we were planning the wedding... then this happened. Lee, well-known in Manchester\u0027s Gay Village as the duty manager at Vanilla, only discovered two years ago that she had Type 1 diabetes. She first met Ruan around five years ago when they both used to get the same bus back from Manchester city centre to Bolton. I said \u0027hi\u0027 to her and she said \u0027hi\u0027 and went to sit at the back, Ruan said. I wanted her to come and sit next to me! Eventually we got to know each other. She was just so loveable. She was very kind and warm-hearted and made an effort to remember everyone.  Even if someone had just been into Vanilla once before - she would try and remember their drink and talk to them. So many people knew her in the Gay Village. When she tried on the wedding dress I cried... she only had two payments left on it. I keep saying to everyone - don\u0027t leave life too late. Steph Kay, Lee\u0027s boss at Vanilla, said she had worked there for around six years and described her as “a complete diamond”. “She was very much a people person, loved and admired by all the staff and customers, Kay said. “She was known for being an obsessive cleaner, but her main passion was cocktails - Collette probably made the best cocktails in the Village! “She was very caring and down to Earth, nothing was too much trouble for her. She would always remember your birthday or anniversary.” "},{"url":null,"title":"celeb golf club used sean","story":"NewsCeleb golf club used by Sean Connery and Tim Henman under investigation over \u0027cruel\u0027 bird traps to catch crowsBerkshire club Sunningdale, which has been in business for 118 years, is the subject of a complaint over \"Larsen\" traps passed to police by the RSPCA\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMartin Fricker18:05, 3 JUN 2018Updated18:07, 3 JUN 2018NewsColin Montgomerie playing at Sunningdale Golf Club which has been hit by an animal cruelty probe over bird traps (Image: Getty Images)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA leading golf club is being probed by police over claims bird traps were used cruelly to catch crows.

James Oliver says he was on a mission in the 21st century from the year 6491, but is unable to get home to his family and friends.  It sounds like something straight out of the plot of one of the Back to the Future films - but now there is evidence he may be telling the truth. Paranormal YouTube site ApexTV hooked him up to a lie detector test and claims he passed every question. His face is blurred out and his accent is a thick Birmingham one, which can sometimes sound American or Australian, and he has a slight lisp.  Your years are different to mine, he tells the presenter, whose face has also been blurred out. There is some obscurity as to whether he lives on planet earth or another planet, as he adds: Where I\u0027m from, the years are longer. My planet is further away from the sun than yours is, so it takes longer to get around. But we have gifted mathematicians who work to calculate our years from those from other civilisations. But he does, however, appear to be human. When he has finished speaking, the word TRUE appears on the screen over the video, but the camera never pans to the laptop to prove he is not lying. He says global warming is going to get worse and our planet is going to get hotter, and advises us to put a cap on carbon emissions. He goes on to say that everyone in the future has their own Artificial Intelligence system called Siri, which recognise users by their voice. He adds: We are constantly finding new planets and galaxies every day. Most of it is just nothing. Sometimes you hit the jackpot and find intelligent life on it. You find new planets, new eco systems. There are a lot of planets more intelligent than humans.  Planets are controlled by an umbrella of elected officials, similar to the United Nations, but all still have some independent control. When asked if there has been fights between humans and aliens, he says: Errr, I can\u0027t....yes, seemingly stuttering.

He claims to work for an alien research agency, specialising in the history and culture of the human race. When asked if he has ever met an alien, he replies: Personally? Several times.

Giorgi Kakava fled with his mother Sophie to Glasgow seven years ago from their native Georgia. The family were in danger because Giorgi\u0027s late father allegedly owed money to gangsters. But after Sophie died in February while waiting for her asylum claim to be decided, the Home Office has threatened to deport Giorgi, and his only remaining relative, grandma Ketino Baikhadze.  A petition set up in support of keeping the pair in Scotland has already reached 53,000 signatures in just three days, the Daily Record reported .   Giorgi has lived in Glasgow since he was three and, according to his grandmother, doesn\u0027t understand a word of the Georgian language. She added: He only speaks English and has grown up in Glasgow where all his friends are, so it would be very hard for him to go there. Ketino is also worried that the gangsters who threatened his father and mother would target their son if he returned to his homeland.  Since the news was first revealed of their fears for deportation , members of the public, politicians and local religious figures have come out in support of the youngster.   The petition was set up by Springburn Parish Church\u0027s Rev Brian Casey, who led the funeral to Giorgi\u0027s mum. Since it was launched just three days ago, 50,000 people have added their signature, showing their support for the boy who, as described by the minister, by all intents and purposes, a Scottish boy. A number of people, including school friends and teachers, have added comments in solidarity with Giorgi on the petition. Adam K commented: I signed because he is my friend at school, while Alyson R added: I teach him. "},{"url":null,"title":"ouch rare lamborghini worth 400000","story":"NewsOuch!

He faces animal cruelty charges and if found guilty, could be sentenced to six months behind bars and a $5,000 fine.

Shannon Vincent, 22, from Wales, had her life turned upside down when she was rushed to hospital where she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Just over a week ago, Shannon went to the doctor after suffering from headaches and a high pulse and thought she might be anaemic.  A blood test confirmed she had leukaemia and Shannon will start treatment within days, Wales Online reports .  Around 650 people are diagnosed with the rare cancer every year that affects the white blood cells.  Although rare, the cancer is the most common type of childhood leukaemia, with around 85% of cases affecting children younger than 15. Shannon, from Pontypridd, is now on a Teenage Cancer Trust ward at hospital in Cardiff waiting for her treatment to start. Explaining how quickly everything happened, she said: “I went to the doctor Friday – I’d been suffering with a fast heart rate, breathlessness, and, headaches. I thought I was probably anaemic. At the appointment she checked my heart rate and told me I needed to go to the hospital to be checked ASAP, as it could be a blood clot. “At the hospital they took my bloods, gave me a chest x-ray and just generally checked me over.  “The next thing I remember being told is that I was anaemic but there was something odd about the blood. “Not long after a specialist came down and told me that it’s highly likely that it’s leukaemia. “I felt like my head had exploded. Cancer? Me? I’m too young. “The rest of the day was a blur. “I was told I had to stay in hospital and I was referred to the Heath, Cardiff, where I received a blood transfusion and was told I had to stay indefinitely.  I’d never stayed in a hospital before and I was terrified. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life, so I just didn’t know how I’d cope with this. “Tuesday I had a bone marrow test to determine what kind of leukaemia I had. I was dreading it. It involved having a needle inserted into your hip bone and some bone marrow sucked out. Shannon then decided to cut her hair before it started to fall out due to the chemotherapy. She said: It was that day I decided to get my hair cut short and into a pixie cut like I’ve always wanted, since I’m likely going to lose all my hair anyway. I felt so liberated. It was the best day I’ve had here so far. “I’ve been diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia, which in short means that the blood cells produced in my bone marrow are growing too fast and not producing properly. “I’ve never smoked, drank heavily, or done any drugs, I was the type of person who would put off taking a painkiller for a headache.  “It’s a cancer that’s more common in children and young adults. I’m on a Teenage Cancer Trust ward and they have been AMAZING so far. Now I’m just waiting to have chemotherapy and I’m absolutely terrified beyond belief. “I don’t handle being ill at the best of times and I have a phobia of throwing up, which really doesn’t help. I’m just thankful for my friends and family, they’ve been here every day and they can’t do enough for me. Shannon said she was speaking out about her ordeal in the hopes or raising awareness about symptoms and that cancer doesn\u0027t discriminate.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope.

It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b111dfa0d8de.jpg ","title":"playpark becomes first in dundee to go smoke free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA playpark in Stobswell has become the designated first smoke-free play area in the city.New signs designed by Glebelands Primary School pupil Weronika Soltys have been unveiled at the playground in Baxter Park.The signs will now be placed across parks throughout the city, restricting smokers from lighting up in play areas.Anne Rendall, neighbourhood services depute convener, said: “By introducing smoke-free playparks in Dundee, we are able to create children’s play areas that are cleaner as there is less chance of cigarette ends being discarded.“I believe these voluntary smoke-free zones will help improve people’s health across the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b10f80c669bf-e1527838783208.jpg ","title":"ralph signs but striker desired","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have added left-back Nathan Ralph as their fourth signing of the summer – but a striker is still top of boss Neil McCann’s wishlist.The 25-year-old moves to the Scottish Premiership from the English National League after suffering relegation with Woking last season.And the Tele revealed way back in January that a move for the former Yeovil Town man was likely in the summer.Gaffer Neil, however, is still working on bringing a goalscorer to the club.He’s made no secret of the fact his team were short in the scoring department last season and adding somebody to put the ball in the net would help him achieve the top-six finish he craves for his side.The club have already made a move for Macauley Bonne.The Leyton Orient striker knocked in an impressive 22 goals in the National League last season and has drawn plenty of interest from English league clubs.The Dark Blues tried to get in there early.

It will also look at the introduction of some of its funniest and most famous characters – Dennis and Gnasher, Rodger the Dodger, Minnie the Minx and, of course, The Bash Street Kids.Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: “The exhibition is amazingly detailed.“It means that real hardcore fans of the Beano and Bash Street Kids are likely to come more than once.“To me, it’s like reading the Beano – you read it the first time then go back and see a wee joke here or there that you maybe missed.“Those wee nuggets will be picked up the more detailed your visit to The McManus is.“The exhibition includes things from the archive that haven’t been seen for years, from the very first issues of the comic right up to the CGI from the Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed series from CBBC – so it’s really unique.”The Bash Street Kids, Beanotown’s most rowdy pupils, have featured in the publication since the 1950s.Mike said: “The Bash Street Kids strip started out life as ‘When the Bell Rings’ in 1954, and that was because the editor at the time encouraged staff to look out the window when the bell was rung at the High School of Dundee for inspiration for the zany antics of the children in the playground.“What the kids were doing ended up in the strip quite regularly and helped the design of the characters.“In 1956 they became the Bash Street Kids and began to focus on the group of kids in Class 2B that we still see today.“Since 1961, David Sutherland has drawn the strip. He ‘retired’ in 1998 but continues to draw it. He’s one of the few artists who still hand in a hard copy of their work – a true legend.“You can imagine how much of his work is included in the exhibition. We will be showing a special movie in which he stars, showing the strip being put together.“I think The McManus is the only place in the world suitable for this because the cartoons are really Dundonian in nature.“Many a time there has been someone walking up Reform Street who has been the inspiration for a character or scene in the Beano, so The McManus really is the only place to showcase this.“For 80 years the Beano has been regularly enjoyed by 27 million people in the UK, so there will be things that appeal to grand-parents and grandchildren, their own memories of the comic over the years as it has evolved.”Meanwhile, illustrator Nigel Parkinson has created an original comic strip starring The Bash Street Kids designing the new sign for The McMenace.The illustration shows them tangled in the “Waldella, Dundee” by artist David Batchelor, which is one of museum’s most popular exhibits.The exhibition runs until Sunday October 21 and entry is free of charge.For further information, visit beano.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past gallery of the week  Glasgow theatres","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7151092.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Radical council plan to give residents control over budget spending","story":"                          Communities in Glasgow will get control of \u0026pound1m of council cash in a pilot scheme to give people more control over decisions."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7866672.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Can you help  Scotland  39 s top dance school needs a new home","story":"                          SCOTLAND\u0027S dance school is desperately seeking a new home with the closure of the Citizen\u0027s Theatre."},{"url":null,"title":"Cruel conmen convince Dennistoun woman  90  to hand over   600 for DIY work -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

Russell clipped in the cross from the right and McBurnie\u0026#8217s powerful header from 10 yards bounced back off the right post.However, four minutes later the Scots were lucky not to be further behind. A counter-attack from a Scottish corner ended with Vela being free in the area.But rather than shoot Vela cut the ball back for Layun, but his effort from close range was blocked by a combination of Bain and Shinnie.On 65 minutes Scotland had another let off when Dylan McGeouch\u0026#8217s poor pass allowed Lozano in and after skipping away from Mulgrew he rattled the crossbar from 10 yards and then sub Marco Fabian blazed the follow up over.With 18 minutes left the ball was in the visitors\u0026#8217 net when sub Oribe Peralta knocked in the rebound after Lozano\u0026#8217s header was saved by Bain, but Peralta was flagged offside.Scotland tried their best to force an equaliser but another clear-cut chance wasn\u0026#8217t forthcoming and Mexico were threatening on the break.In the 90th minute sub Jesus Corona got clear and lobbed the ball beyond the advancing Bain but Mulgrew headed off the line.Mexico: Guillermo Ochoa, Jesus Gallardo, Carlos Salcedo (Rafael Marquez 46), Hugo Ayala, Miguel Layun, Edson Alvarez, Hector Herrera (Marco Fabian 57), Giovani dos Santos (Jonathon dos Santos 57), Hirving Lozano (Jesus Corona 73), Carlos Vela (Javier Aquino 63), Raul Jiminez (Oribe Peralta 57).Subs not used: Alfredo Talavera, Javier Hernandez, Erick Gutierrez, Jesus Molina.Scotland: Jon McLaughlin (Scott Bain 46), Stephen O\u0026#8217Donnell, Jack Hendry, Scott McKenna, Graeme Shinnie Johnny Russell, Dylan McGeouch, Kenny McLean (Chris Cadden 55), Callum Paterson (Charlie Mulgrew 55), Ryan Christie (John McGinn 55), Oliver McBurnie (Lewis Morgan 80).Subs not used: Jordan Archer, Jamie Murphy.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/IMG_2084-e1527853798398-780x564.jpg ","title":"beer of the week stone ipa","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStone Brewing, headquartered in California but brewing in Berlin, pops up regularly when chatting to bar staff about good beers.When I spotted their IPA on the shelf at Tesco (I had popped in for milk, honest) I thought I\u0026#8217d give this West Coast IPA a go.It fills the glass with a lovely antique gold, crystal-clear beer, topped with a pleasing white head.The nose is subtle, citrus lemon and a hint of Weetabix about it.It has great body and mouth feel with a juicy attack and those citrus notes are nicely sharp, then it\u0026#8217s washed away almost immediately with a huge hoppiness.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

The council believes this will make the process faster and easier for people thinking about building their own home.A community information and feedback event will be held on Wednesday June 6 at Lochgilphead Community Centre from 1pm to 6.30pm, with presentations scheduled for 2pm and 5.30pm.Anyone interested in the Simplified Planning Zones is invited to attend and will be able to ask questions, get involved in shaping the design and find out much more about each of the proposed sites.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017).

Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland.

He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Community leaders in Stranraer, desperate to lick their own sand back in shape, want to use the South Ayrshire model of success. It follows Prestwick’s hard fought battle to convince council bosses to clean up their rubble-strewn shore. Norrie Smith, vice chair of Prestwick South Community Council, performed the role of special envoy on a trip down the coast. He said: “The guys down there were very keen to talk to us about how we went about things. “Their problem is slightly different in terms of what they need to clean up, but the premise is the same. “They’ve got a fantastic community asset, much like ours, and it’s just about returning it to its rightful state and making the most of it.”  While weeds and silt are dogging Stranraer’s shoreline, Prestwick is facing the ongoing battle of mounting rubble. Already, more than 500 tonnes has been removed from the beach since council diggers were sent in to level the sand. Norrie added: “We’re delighted that our example has been recognised elsewhere. “People in this town campaigned long and hard to get where we are now, and if we can help others by sharing best practice then great. “I’m all for collaboration, whether it’s in your own town or further afield, so linking up like this can only be a positive thing.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles.

Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached.

space development on Lowood Estate, as part of a wider Tweedbank expansion proposal, which would seek to attract existing and new residents and businesses moving into the area, including those who would wish to use the nearby Borders Railway as a key transport mode.\nThe prospectus also identifies opportunities to expand Tweedbank village and reposition the current industrial estate as a new Borders Innovation Park.\nThe Tweedbank Masterplan was developed as part of the Borders Railway Blueprint Programme, and was carried out at the same time as a similar piece of work on Galashiels.\u0026nbsp\nBoth these masterplans, which are available on the Council\u0026rsquos website, present a variety of proposals to encourage people to live, learn, visit and work in the area, as well as attract inward investment through public and private investment and partnership working.\nCouncillor Mark Rowley, SBC\u0026rsquos executive member for business and economic development, with responsibility for housing, said: \u0026ldquoAny discussions and negotiations around the purchase of land is clearly commercially sensitive and therefore we cannot go into detail, however following discussions and background work over a period of time the Council has now taken the opportunity to get a decision from Elected Members to proceed to more formal negotiations with the owners of the estate.\n\u0026ldquoThere are clear benefits to this strategic site being in the Council\u0026rsquos ownership and control in terms of facilitating the development of the land in line with the Local Development Plan and future proofing for the extension of the Borders Railway.\n\u0026ldquoClearly this is a long-term strategy, and negotiations around the potential purchase of the site are a first step, and one which must be handled sensitively and dealt with in private.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Biggest and best Junior Rideout yet in Selkirk","story":"ORGANISERS of the fourth Selkirk Junior

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Children to meet leading authors

club members looked for any trees rubbish or other obstacles that may have fallen into the river, or been washed down stream, after the winter spates, which would block or obstruct the seatrout and salmon run.Salmon and seatrout need overhanging trees and shrubs for cover and can hide from their many predators, so it is important that the cutting of overhanging trees is done with the utmost care.Members only remove and trim anything that interferes with the fish having a stress free run up river or which blocks pools to the extent that the river could start to erode its banks.This has the bonus of making the pool more accessible for anglers to cast flies or spinners.The river clearing is not only for the anglers benefit all sizes of bushes and trees are washed down stream and can also be washed out to sea causing problems for trawlers which may catch them in their nets.Carradale angling club also have the fishing on Tangy loch which has a good stock of wild brown trout.The loch provides early season fishing for members and visitors, who are waiting for the right conditions to fish the river, and for anglers who only fish on still water.The trout season started on March 15 and the loch has been fishing well with members reporting some very good catches.In May every tide gives anglers an early chance to catch seatrout and the tidal water is always worth a go even when the river is at summer levels.To fish Carradale river or Tangy loch a permit is required.To join Carradale angling club or for a day permit contact the secretary David Shaw on 07909991388 or ask Kenny

Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"picnicing in glengyles spring sunshine","story":"Last Friday, on the 10th festival\u0026#8217s final day, at Glengyle, the emphasis was on fun for all the family and the Whisky Warrior Challenges, for adult whisky connoisseurs, who thought they had seen it all.These athletic tasks, set by the Wee Toon Warrior\u0026#8217s fitness fanatic, Fiona Irwin, included: The Grubby Grubber \u0026#8211 have you got what it takes to be a master maltster?
