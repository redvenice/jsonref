I work my legs hard, I look good and I play good music – you have to pay a lot if you want that kind of luxury.‘I charged £206 because there were four people and I was going uphill. I didn’t even charge them the full amount – it should have been £412. Sure, £10 a minute is expensive, but that’s only if I go uphill. For downhill, it’s £10 for ten minutes.’In December 2015 another driver allegedly tried to charge a tourist £600 for a half-hour ride outside Selfridges.A passerby heard them being charged £10 a minute per person and the driver said the price had been agreed beforehand.Drink-driving PC sacked after getting caught at nearly twice the legal limitErdi Topalca, another rickshaw driver, told the evening standard: ‘Half an hour and he asked them for £600?

Doug Ducey, front right, met with Arizona National Guard soldiers prior to their deployment to the Mexico border at the Papago Park Military Reservation on MondayIn Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has pledged to put more than 1,000 Guard members into action, military officials said Tuesday that 300 troops would report to armories this week for preparation and training. Texas has previously kept about 100 Guard members stationed on the border for years as part of its own border security efforts.\u0027What is different now it is happening in a different context and a different narrative,\u0027 said Fernando Garcia, director of the Border Network for Human Rights, an immigrant advocacy group.Speaking from the Rio Grande Valley where immigrant crossings are the highest along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, Garcia said, \u0027When you hear the narrative of the president, it seems to him the enemy is the immigrant family.\u0027Abbott said in a statement Tuesday that the Guard has \u0027proven to have a meaningful impact\u0027 in reducing immigration and crime.In the Texas border town of Roma, about a half-dozen uniformed Guard members were seen Tuesday near an international bridge along the Rio Grande. Children played just across the river in Mexico, and it wasn\u0027t clear whether the Guard members were new or part of Texas\u0027 earlier observe-and-report missions.  Children from Anapra, Mexico, climbed a section of the new border wall recently built near Santa Teresa, New Mexico on Monday  The International border cuts through Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, right, and Nogales, Ariz.One guard member was armed with an M4 rifle and used binoculars to peer across the river. Pickup trucks with guard members inside circled the town square along with border patrol vehicles. Mexican children who had attended school on the U.S. side of the border showed their passports and paid a toll to cross a bridge over the river and walk home to the Mexican community of Ciudad Miguel Aleman.Trump said last week he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard members to the border, issuing a proclamation citing \u0027the lawlessness that continues at our southern border.\u0027Trump administration officials have said that rising numbers of people being caught at the southern border, while in line with seasonal trends in recent years, require an immediate response.Monthly border arrests surpassed 50,000 in March for the first time since December 2016. The Border Patrol, which polices between but not at official crossings, made more than 37,000 of those arrests, including more than 14,000 in Texas\u0027 Rio Grande Valley, nearly 6,000 in its Tucson, Arizona, sector and more than 4,000 in San Diego.  Aaron Hull, chief patrol agent of the U. S. Customs and Border Protection\u0027s El Paso Sector, spoke Monday where construction of a new segment of the border wall will be built  A Customs and Border Patrol agent is seen patrolling a sliver of the vast international border on TuesdayInspectors at official crossings made nearly 13,000 arrests in March, led by the Laredo, Texas, field office with more than 4,800 and the San Diego field office with about 3,800.Apprehensions are still well below their historical trends during the terms of former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both of whom also deployed the Guard to the border.Some Guard members will be armed if they are placed in potential danger, Abbott said, adding he wanted to downplay speculation that \u0027our National Guard is showing up with military bayonets trying to take on anybody that\u0027s coming across the border, because that is not their role.\u0027There is no end date for the deployment, Abbott said: \u0027We may be in this for the long haul.\u0027Trump has said he wants to use the military at the border until progress is made on his proposed border wall, which has mostly stalled in Congress.

Prince Harry interviews former US President Barack Obama as part of his guest editorship of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme in December‘This is very much about them getting married surrounded by their families and friends,’ a source said.‘It is not a big state occasion in any way. It is an intimate family wedding. Well, as intimate as a royal wedding can be.’The prince’s spokesman said the Queen backed her grandson’s decision not to invite politicians or foreign dignitaries for the sake of it.          The couple have decided not to invite any political leaders both from the UK and abroad, which means that even British Prime Minister Theresa May isn\u0027t on the list. Pictured is Prince Harry and Barack Obama at the Invictus Games in Canada last yearKensington Palace said: ‘It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international – is not required for Prince Harry and Miss Markle’s wedding. Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.’ Government sources said Theresa May ‘wasn’t expecting an invitation’.Despite the wedding being an important national occasion, Harry is not in the direct line of succession – unlike his elder brother, Prince William, who had no choice but to invite dozens of politicians and Commonwealth representatives to his 2011 Westminster Abbey nuptials.Harry is currently fifth in line to the throne, but after the birth of his third niece or nephew later this month, will slip to sixth, behind the Cambridges’ three children.Prince Harry and Miss Markle have also chosen a much smaller venue than William and Kate, who were able to fit around 1,200 guests into Westminster Abbey, including then-Prime Minister David Cameron.

Michelle and myself are interested in promoting it.\u0027When the Invictus Games was held in Florida last year the two men struck up a hilarious viral rivalry to publicise the competition, Harry playing the trump card by invoking his grandmother, the Queen to appear in a short \u0027skit\u0027 with him.There was another opportunity to catch up in April last year when Barack and Michelle joined William, Kate and Harry at Kensington Palace, where they met Prince George. The pair also attended this year\u0027s Invictus Games in Toronto this year, and were seen laughing together as they cheered on the athletes at the wheelchair basketball event.An onlooker even reported hearing the former president asking Harry about Meghan Markle and whether she was enjoying the games. The royal was one of the many high-profile guests at the former U.S. president\u0027s first Obama Foundation Summit in October.The 33-year-old was photographed sitting in the audience at the two-day event held at the Marriott Marquis McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois one row behind Obama and his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama.               Prince Harry with the Obamas ahead of a dinner hosted by William and Kate at Kensington Palace in April 2016                        "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/01/4B07E21500000578-5601473-Triathlete_James_Edgar_from_Northern_Ireland_was_sure_to_inform_-a-1_1523407958128.jpg","title":"Commonwealth Games athletes boast Tinder night","story":"    English boxer Luke McCormack (pictured) was among several Commonwealth Games athletes to inform Tinder users of his intention to \u0027have some fun while I\u0027m out here\u0027          Triathlete James Edgar from Northern Ireland was sure to inform prospective partners of his premium endurance, which ensured he \u0027can go all night long\u0027          Javelin throw star from Canada, Andre, boasted his impressive height and informed fans his sole objective was to have some funWhile some opted to keep their personal descriptions free of frisky language, others have gone in guns blazing - making no secret of their promiscuous intentions.Among those to thrust themselves onto the site was English boxer Luke McCormack, who bared his chiseled abs in a shirtless poolside photo.\u0027Sam Armytage, we still want an apology!\u0027 Angry Aboriginal...\u0027That\u0027s the best thing I\u0027ve seen all games!\u0027 Energetic young...Midas touch!

Debbie Dingell (left) pointed out how many things Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (right) didn\u0027t seem to know about his own website           Rep. Ben Ray Luján told Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that he didn\u0027t like how non-users would have to sign up for a Facebook page in order to see what the social network had scooped up about them Luján took issue with the practice because non-users currently had to sign up for Facebook if they wanted to see what data of theirs the social network collected. \u0027You\u0027ve said everyone controls their data, by you\u0027re collecting data on people that are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement,\u0027 Luján said, encouraging Zuckerberg to fix the problem. During the five-hour hearing, the Facebook CEO revealed that his own personal data had been included when 87 million or so Facebook users had their data improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  \u0027Yes,\u0027 he answered when asked by Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat, whether his data was included in the data sold to malicious third parties. \u0027Your personal data?\u0027 Eshoo clarified.  But he pushed back on  suggestions from the members of the House of Representatives that users do not have enough control of their data on Facebook in the wake of the privacy scandal at the world\u0027s largest social media network.\u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control. Right there,\u0027 he said.\u0027Not buried in the settings somewhere but right there,\u0027 the 33-year-old internet magnate told the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee.          Push back: \u0027Every time that someone chooses to share something on Facebook ... there is a control. Right there,\u0027 Zuckerberg said to the House Energy and Commerce Committee    Facebook CEO is swarmed by photographers as he arrives to testify before House members on Wednesday            No boost for Zuck: The Facebook CEO was back in a regular chair after he got an extra cushion on Tuesday when he appeared in front of the Senate joint committee  The way he was: How Zuckerberg got a boost as he testified to the Senate joint committee on Tuesday           In one of the odder moments of the day, Rep. Michael Burgess made a point to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (left) using a Dilbert cartoon about \u0027terms and conditions\u0027           Rep. Michael Burgess also shared the cartoon on Twitter explaining that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data\u0027 Once again wearing a dark suit instead of his usual gray T-shirt, the hearing was Zuckerberg\u0027s second in two days. CONGRESSMAN BRINGS DILBERT CARTOON TO FACEBOOK HEARING Beyond Cambridge Analytica, lawmakers asked questions Wednesday about Facebook\u0027s terms of use, and if the social network censored certain types of political speech.  Rep. Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, brought along with him a vintage Dilbert cartoon to make a point about Facebook\u0027s \u0027terms and conditions.\u0027  \u0027I consulted my technology consultant Scott Adams, in the form of Dilbert,\u0027 Burgess said. The cartoon strip shows Dilbert telling Dogbert, \u0027I didn\u0027t read all of my shrink-wrap license agreement on my new software until after I opened it. Apparently I agreed to spend the rest as a towel boy in Bill Gates\u0027 new mansion.\u0027  \u0027Call your lawyer,\u0027 recommends the small white cartoon dog.  \u0027Too late, he opened software yesterday. Now he\u0027s Bill\u0027s laundry boy,\u0027 Dilbert responded, referencing Microsoft\u0027s CEO. Burgess\u0027 broader point, which he articulated in a tweet, is that too few Americans read the \u0027terms and conditions,\u0027 adding that \u0027consumers should have the tools and resources they need to understand how to protect their own data.\u0027 ZUCKERBERG ASKED ABOUT FACEBOOK PREDECESSOR \u0027FACEMASH\u0027  Rep. Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, deployed an interesting line of questioning, asking Zuckerberg about the origins of \u0027Facemash\u0027 and if it was still up and running. \u0027No, congressman. Facemash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,\u0027 Zuckerberg replied. \u0027There was a movie about this, it says it was about this, of unclear truth, and the claim that Facemash was somehow connected to the development of Facebook, it isn\u0027t, it wasn\u0027t,\u0027 the CEO continued, referencing the 2010 movie, \u0027The Social Network.\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that he created that website in 2003. \u0027It actually has nothing do to with Facebook,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you put up pictures of women and decide which one was the better, the more attractive of the two, is that right?\u0027 Long asked. Zuckerberg said that was right. \u0027Congressman, that is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was sophomore in college,\u0027 the CEO said, as Long made comments about the website\u0027s beginnings.           After asking about Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s \u0027Facemash\u0027 website, Rep. Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, brought up perceived bias against Trump-supporting sisters, Diamond and Silk          Rep. Billy Long even went as far as to have an aide hold up a picture of the two women and asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who they were. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 the 33-year-old CEO answered LAWMAKERS FIXATE ON DIAMOND AND SILK CONTROVERSYLong then asked staff to hold up a large photograph and asked Zuckerberg to describe who was pictured. \u0027I believe that, is that Diamond and Silk?\u0027 Zuckerberg asked. Long said it was. \u0027That is Diamond and Silk, two biological sisters from North Carolina, I might point out they\u0027re African-American, and their content was deemed by your folks to be unsafe,\u0027 Long said. \u0027Diamond and Silk have a question for you. And that question is, What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\u0027 he continued. A number of Republican lawmakers asked Zuckerberg questions about the Trump-supporting sisters over his two days of testimony on Capitol Hill. \u0027Well Congressman, nothing is unsafe about that,\u0027 Zuckerberg answered.  Facebook acknowledged sending a message to the sisters, prominent conservative video bloggers, deeming their content \u0027unsafe,\u0027 but the social network said the contents of the message were \u0027inaccurate.\u0027 \u0027We have communicated directly with Diamond And Silk about this issue. The message they received last week was inaccurate and not reflective of the way we communicate with our community and the people who run Pages on our platform,\u0027 Facebook\u0027s spokeswoman Sarah Pollack said. In front of lawmakers, Zuckerberg was caught flat-footed, as the Diamond and Silk situation had developed over the past several days. \u0027The specifics of this situation I am not as up to speed on as I would be,\u0027 Zuckerberg told Long.   Other Republicans brought up the Diamond and Silk incident to ask the Facebook co-founder questions about political bias. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, deployed that line of questioning on Tuesday.  \u0027There are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship,\u0027 Cruz said. \u0027There have been numerous instances with Facebook.\u0027  Rep. Joe Barton, another Texas Republican, held up his phone and told Zuckerberg he was going to ask him a question that someone had submitted to the congressman\u0027s Facebook account. \u0027First question: Please ask Mr. Zuckerberg, why is Facebook censoring conservative bloggers such as Diamond and Silk? Facebook called them unsafe to the community. That is absurd. They hold conservative views. That isn\u0027t unsafe,\u0027 Barton said reading the question, and adding his own, \u0027What\u0027s your response?\u0027 Zuckerberg explained that his team had made \u0027an enforcement error.\u0027 \u0027And we\u0027ve already gotten in touch with them to reverse it,\u0027 he said, referring to Diamond and Silk. Later on in the hearing Wednesday, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican running for Senate, asked whether free speech is being censored by the site.Zuckerberg used the example of terrorism, as the types of posts that would be pulled from Facebook. \u0027Let me tell you right now, Diamond and Silk is not terrorism,\u0027 Blackburn scoffed.  WALL STREET INVESTORS LOVE ZUCK On Tuesday, Zuckerberg took questions for nearly five hours in a Senate hearing without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business, foiling attempts by senators to pin him down. Investors were impressed with his initial performance. Shares in Facebook posted their biggest daily gain in nearly two years on Tuesday, closing up 4.5 percent. They were down 0.7 percent in early trading on Wednesday.On Wednesday Zuckerberg\u0027s testimony further bolstered investors\u0027 views of the company, with the CEO\u0027s performance leading them to believe that the company would weather the storm surrounding Cambridge Analytica.   Facebook has been consumed by turmoil for nearly a month, since it came to light that millions of users\u0027 personal information was wrongly harvested from the website by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted President Trump\u0027s election campaign among its clients.Zuckerberg faced broad concerns from members of Congress about how Facebook shares user data.          A number of lawmakers have complained over Facebook\u0027s treatment of Diamond and Silk, prominent Trump supporters, which the company has said it\u0027s remedying  Lawmaker turns on Zuckerberg telling him \u0027as CEO you didn\u0027t...Dow Jones drops 200 points as markets get jittery over...Zuckerberg warns of ¿arms race¿ with Russian trolls who will...Facebook launches \u0027bug bounty\u0027 program offering up to...Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are sued by British and US...Zuckerberg is quizzed repeatedly on perceived left-wing bias...Share this article    Back in the hot seat: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned Wednesday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee after a joint committee of the Senate had questioned him on Tuesday\u0027How can consumers have control over their data when Facebook does not have control over the data?\u0027 asked Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce committee.The latest estimate of affected users is up to 87 million.Patience with the social network had already worn thin among users, advertisers and investors after the company said last year that Russia used Facebook for years to try to sway U.S. politics, an allegation Moscow denies.Lawmakers have sought assurances that Facebook can effectively police itself, and few came away from Tuesday\u0027s hearing expressing confidence in the social network.\u0027I don\u0027t want to vote to have to regulate Facebook, but by God, I will,\u0027 Republican Senator John Kennedy told Zuckerberg on Tuesday. \u0027A lot of that depends on you.\u0027Zuckerberg deflected requests to support specific legislation. Pressed repeatedly by Democratic Sen. Ed Markey to endorse a proposed law that would require companies to get people\u0027s permission before sharing personal information, Zuckerberg agreed to further talks.\u0027In principle, I think that makes sense, and the details matter, and I look forward to having our team work with you on fleshing that out,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.But those qualms didn\u0027t rattle Wall Street as Zuckerberg testified that despite the #DeleteFacebook movement, the number of uses of the website hasn\u0027t gone down significantly.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/11/15/4B0AD3DB00000578-0-image-a-6_1523456285803.jpg","title":"Inside Yoga enclave hidden deep Indian jungle","story":"    German photojournalist David Klammer\u0027s incredible photographs give a glimpse into the lives of Auroville\u0027s residents          More than 3,000 people from 50 countries co-exist peacefully without a mayor or police in the town, hidden in the South Indian jungle\u0027The people living there come from over 50 countries.

Some of the town\u0027s residents - who have come from 50 different countries from all over the world - live in small, unique homes          But over the years, apartment complexes have been built to accommodate the town\u0027s growing population          Matrimandir Inner Chamber (pictured) is a place for Auroville\u0027s residents and visitors to go for \u0027inidual silent concentration\u0027 \u0027The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity.\u0027She envisaged Auroville as a city for 50,000 people from around the world.Although the idea came to her as early as the 1930s, it was put before the government of India in the 1960s.The General Assembly of UNESCO backed it as a project of importance for the future of humanity in 1966 and an inauguration ceremony was held two years later on February 28, 1968.Some 5,000 people gathered near the banyan tree at the centre of the township, in Tamil Nadu, for the ceremony.          David Klammer has been documenting people from the utopian town of Auroville over the course of three visits           As well as residents from more than 50 countries, Auroville is also popular with tourists and backpackersAttendees included representatives from more than 100 nations, who brought with them soil from their native lands that were mixed in a lotus-shaped urn that is now a focal point of the town\u0027s amphitheatre.This year marks the 50th anniversary of the town, whose citizens apply the ideas of the Auroville Charter into their daily lives.Mr Klammer adds that over the years, the town is becoming \u0027more ordinary.\u0027\u0027There are still those nice and unique houses, but more and more apartment complexes are built,\u0027 he said.

A new “basic” fare has been introduced for passengers who have only hand baggage, with tickets costing up to £60 less than the standard return fare, the airline said.Basic fare tickets went on sale on Wednesday for flights from London to Austin, Boston, Delhi, Denver, Dubai, Hong Kong, Oakland, Philadelphia, Punta Cana and Singapore. The cheapest fare – to Dubai – will cost £143 each way.Passengers will still be served complimentary food and drink and be able to take two items of hand luggage on board. But checking a bag for people flying on basic fare tickets will cost from £80 return, with seat selection starting at £20 each way. BA already offers this type of basic fare on its short-haul flights.The airline said the move to offer a basic fare on long-haul routes was about being competitive with operators offering cheaper flights and was not about increasing the cost of a standard fare.“We know that when our customers travel with us, their needs vary from trip to trip. Some will be flying on business, some for leisure, some will be on short hops, others will be longer stays,” said BA’s chief commercial officer, Adam Daniel. “We need to ensure that the fares we provide reflect those differing needs so customers can select the best option for them on that occasion.“Someone travelling for a short meeting or leisure break, who isn’t planning to check in a bag and is happy for us to allocate them a seat, will appreciate the option to secure a lower fare. They’ll still receive our generous hand baggage allowance, a seat allocated to them in advance, complimentary food and drink, in-flight entertainment, blankets and headphones, all at no extra cost.”The changes are part of a larger rollout by BA’s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), which will see American Airlines, Iberia and Finnair also introduce the basic fare.Last month Virgin Atlantic launched its first hand-baggage-only ticket in a major revamp of its economy service. It is offering cheaper fares on its routes that are similar to low-cost competitors, where passengers can take only cabin luggage and are not able to choose their seat in advance.In January the budget airline Ryanair changed its rules to restrict passengers to take only one small piece of hand luggage into the cabin – rather than the two items previously allowed – unless they paid for priority boarding – £5 when first booked or £6 later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc7fd6ca8228d666efb528b5117a76bdf53ccdd6/0_397_5880_3528/master/5880.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33bf6a12390115482bda7f09b3d4c4f 11500w","title":"the gold coast sun drenched sin city that wants to shine","story":"Famed for parties, brawls and bikini-clad meter maids, Australia’s Vegas is more dynamic than its mythology suggests Pristine beaches stretching for 70km, enviable weather, world heritage-listed Gondwana rainforests, and enough big city infrastructure to keep punters interested – Australia’s Gold Coast is a pleasure centre. But for many it has a pervasive dark side: a city once branded as a sunny place for shady people.One of Australia’s most revered writers once told me he comes here to have his breakdowns. On a visit in 1997, Prince Charles was reported to have said its gaudy skyscrapers contributed to the “uglification” of one of the world’s top holiday spots. In 1984, the prominent Sydney architect Neville Gruzman suggested the city should be bulldozed into the surf.Today, the Gold Coast seems to be attempting that reinvention itself. It is Australia’s fastest growing city and larger than three of its capital cities (Canberra, Hobart and Darwin), with the 2018 Commonwealth Games doubtless accelerating a maturation already under way.Every month or so there’s a new hip place to be seen, an old high rise disappears and a shiny new one soars. Every week some new claim is made for the ultimate in gastronomic happiness.Do these ventures live up to the hype? Sometimes. But it hardly matters. The Gold Coast is a city built on hype, on rise and fall. As a longtime resident, I’ve experienced several waves of self-proclaimed urban renaissance and learned that, while the spin exists largely to generate the sale of sky homes, each growth phase possesses a grain of truth.The Gold Coast wants to grow up. But is that possible when the rest of the country’s estimations of it are so rigid?Unlike many major Australian cities, the Gold Coast does not retain much evidence of a colonial urban sensibility, in part because of rampant redevelopment and erasure, but largely because it never really got started.The urban vision was always more closely linked to a 20th-century American aesthetic. The influence of the strip cities of Miami, Los Angeles and particularly Las Vegas are in evidence as well as, more recently, nods to the 21st-century architectural ambition of Dubai and Shanghai. While each of these cities have marked differences they all share a postwar history of urban expansion and proliferation.All have grown at phenomenal rates, new frontier cities that owe less to major port affiliations or centrifugal notions of planning than they do to strip formations, late capitalism and experimental development. The big-ticket architecture says so.The $1bn luxury Jewel project currently under development epitomises this push for opulent new millennium design. An example of continuing high-end investment in architectural innovation, the development is a six-star three-tower structure modelled on shards of smoky quartz crystals found on a mountain in the region. The interpretation is refreshingly abstract compared with the ubiquitous “palm tree, primary colour” resort styling the Gold Coast has leaned so much on in the past.Across many sectors, the city is shrugging off the declarative localism it has played to in exchange for a more sophisticated spin on where it sits in the world. It will be interesting to note how the international spotlight will burn. In 2016, international tourism figures peaked at one million. Tourists from Asia make up the majority of those, as they have for decades. People from Singapore get the Gold Coast, as do people people from Hong Kong and Dubai – they are all cities that share a new frontier urban aesthetic.The real opposition to the Gold Coast’s ambition is national. Australians often experience the city in hyperactive mode, arriving to soak up the sun and get away with what they’re less likely to at home raging down streets like no one lives here, hiring mopeds and tuk tuks blasting Justin Bieber or ACDC, high on party drugs or table-sized martinis. Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.They may have visited in a pack of mates at the annual Schoolies festival – a Spring Break equivalent that erupted in the 1970s and still attracts tens of thousands of school leavers. Or they may have vibrant memories of flying through the hyperreal universes of the Dreamworld, Movieworld and Seaworld theme parks as kids. It’s these off-kilter experiences – the combination of bright lights, sunburnt skin and cringey recollections – twinned with the consistent media overplay that continue to define national opinions of a city locals affectionately refer to as “the Goldie”.It is not unusual for major cities to have underworlds: corrupt power centres and schlocky, sometimes violent nightclub strips. It’s just that the depiction of such things erupting on Australia’s Gold Coast makes great trash TV. Stock footage proliferates of schoolies vomiting in bins, bikies brawling in restaurants, meter maids in gold bikinis and bare-knuckle violence – but these things exist as a fraction of a much larger whole.The burgeoning arts scene is emblematic of the city’s evolution. Twenty years ago, arts visibility, policy and recognition barely existed, and certainly not at levels that could match commercial imperatives. Today, the Gold Coast can hold its own. Under the directives of the Culture Strategy 2023, the city council has invested $7m in the development of an arts and cultural programme for Festival 2018, linked to the Commonwealth Games, while a $365m cultural precinct funded by all levels of government will be launched in stages. Yet the attitude of the rest of Australia towards the city, even though it is now one of the top five tourist destinations nationally, seems to be: “We want you to stay in your box.” Evidence of the Gold Coast’s continuing appeal as a preferred place to holiday and live goes largely unacknowledged.In part, this paradox is related to class. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, but it can be highly parochial and territorial. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne is legendary neither would ever consider the Gold Coast as worthy of debate.The city’s location in Queensland doesn’t help. From 1968 to 1987, the state was under the corrupt rule of the disgraced premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, known as the “hillbilly dictator”, who fostered the creation of a police state and opposed homosexuality, abortion, demonstrations against anti-apartheid and even the 40-hour work week. Perceptions of Queenslanders have been affected ever since.This is no different from the idea that Parisians are all rude or New Yorkers unfriendly. The Gold Coast is more dynamic than its enduring mythologies suggest. It does not so much resemble an overgrown Porpoise Spit, the mythical town made famous by the film Muriel’s Wedding: an acrylic land of hoop earrings, dumb surfers and undone housewives burning down backyards.Cities have moods and boroughs, and things only locals know. They are at their best when they surprise when you sink in to the city and relate to it on its own terms. The Gold Coast has been allowed to be trashy, glitzy and even obscene, as long as it doesn’t gatecrash the VIP party – one smoky quartz slipper already dangerously close to the rope. In any case, this won’t be the city’s last renaissance.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

The BBC appoints a prominent radical leftist, a lifelong Bennite, the chairman of the publisher of a prominent leftwing publication no less, as its flagship political presenter and interviewer. This person has made speeches in homage of Karl Marx calling for the establishment of full-blooded socialism in Britain, including a massive increase in public ownership, hiking taxes on the rich to fund a huge public investment programme, and reversing anti-union laws. They appear on our “impartial” Auntie Beeb wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of a hardline leftist thinktank. Their BBC editor is a former Labour staffer who moves to become Jeremy Corbyn’s communications chief. They use their Twitter feed – where they have amassed hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to a platform handed to them by the BBC – to promote radical leftist causes.This would never happen. It is unthinkable, in fact. If the BBC establishment somehow entered this parallel universe, the British press would be on the brink of insurrection. And yet, the strange case of Andrew Neil, the ultra-Thatcherite former Sunday Times editor who is the BBC’s flagship political presenter, is an instructive example about how our media works.Neil is a formidable political interviewer in many ways: forensic, unrelenting, quick-witted, sardonic. But consider the background of this former Conservative party researcher. When Jeremy Corbyn had the audacity to meet with leftwing Jewish group Jewdas, Neil smeared them as “nutters” last year, he made a speech denouncing antisemitism on the left. To be clear, leftwing antisemitism exists and must be vanquished. But Neil has no moral authority on this issue. As editor of the Sunday Times in 1992, he hired Britain’s foremost Holocaust denier, Nazi apologist David Irving, to work on the Goebbels diaries. To hire a sympathiser of Hitler and denier of the worst atrocity in history to do respectable work for a national newspaper – to offer a reputational lifeline to a man who should have been treated as a pariah – was a disgrace for which he has never apologised. As the Wiener Library, the oldest institution devoted to the study of the Holocaust, said at the time: “David Irving denies the gas chambers. Anyone who deals with him is tainted with that.”Not long after becoming a high-profile BBC presenter, Neil made a speech in homage to rightwing radical Friedrich Hayek, in which he called for a “radical programme to liberalise the British economy a radical reduction in tax and public spending as a share of the economy” as well as a flat tax “and the injection of choice and competition into the public sector on a scale not yet contemplated”. During last year’s general election, he presented the Daily Politics wearing a tie emblazoned with the logo of the hardcore neoliberal Adam Smith Institute. His editor was Robbie Gibb, a former adviser to Michael Portillo – another longstanding colleague of Neil on This Week. Last year Gibb became Theresa May’s head of communications.Neil’s Twitter account – which has hundreds of thousands of followers thanks to his BBC gig – is routinely used to promote rightwing causes. He uses this platform to denounce the scientific consensus on climate change, reviling what he calls “the climate mafia” and claiming that deviation from the consensus meant “the witch-finders want to burn you”. It is not the first time he has deviated from scientific consensus. When he was Sunday Times editor, his newspaper ran a series of articles arguing that HIV did not cause Aids. It was a theme picked up by the Spectator 15 years later. Let’s be clear: this contemptible myth risked people’s lives. His Twitter feed, too, reveals a relentless sympathy for Brexit and denunciation of its critics. A valid political perspective, but not coming from the BBC’s main politics presenter on the biggest issue facing Britain. Again unsurprising, given that he once called “for a reorientation of British foreign policy away from Europe towards Asia and Latin America”and “unilateral free trade, regardless of the policy in Brussels”.His firebrand rightwing politics aside, Neil skins politicians alive across the political spectrum, comes the inevitable retort. There is no question that Neil is exceptionally bright and well-read with an acute eye for detail: it is a grave error to turn up unprepared with him in the chair, as I discovered in one of my earliest TV appearances. And yes, he did recently take down a Tory minister for the absurd smears against Corbyn over a crank ex-Czechoslovak spy: that he was applauded for doing his job here shows how low the left’s expectations are. But as a general rule, while Neil will fillet politicians on both left and right on the basis of competence, he reserves his ideological assaults on the left, ridiculing Corbyn over Russia – which one would expect on US TV networks, where impartiality rules do not apply.Last month, when Green MP Caroline Lucas tabled an Urgent Question on bullying and harassment in Parliament, Neil excoriated her for not talking about rape in Telford instead. When Lucas responded that the Telford case was “absolutely appalling” and that she backed an urgent public inquiry into the matter, but that didn’t mean MPs shouldn’t get their own House in order, Neil denounced her for making a comparison between “what some middle class women had suffered” and the Telford scandal – one he alone had made. The consequence was an online pile-on. Imagine if a prominent leftwing BBC journalist existed and launched such a baseless out-of-nowhere attack on a rightwing politician?Why does this all matter? Critiquing any prominent journalist normally results in a defensive backlash: it is regarded as the ultimate sin within media ranks. But the issue here is about a system. The media are one of the most essential pillars of any democracy, and must be critiqued as such. The usual BBC defence is that the corporation is attacked from both sides, and therefore must be neutral. This is a logical fallacy. For one, it does not take into account which side is more assertive or dominant. Our press overwhelmingly supports the Tories and is intolerant of even mild deviations from rightwing orthodoxy. The BBC itself is dominated by social and economic liberalism, which is why it provokes ire from left and right: but that isn’t neutrality, either. Its daily news priorities are set and framed by the front pages of Conservative-supporting newspapers.Neil himself would be the most intimidating and effective rightwing polemicist in Britain if he was freed from the BBC. But the fact that somebody as stridently leftwing as he is rightwing would never be appointed to such a position is indicative of how our media operate. Many on the left fear that any critique of Auntie will play into the hands of a right wing that would privatise and gut the BBC if it could. This deference means that BBC political output remains framed by rightwing assumptions. The Media Reform Coalition has suggested a series of proposals, such as freeing the BBC from all government interference and a BBC board elected by licence-payers and BBC staff. At the very least, as the case of Neil underlines, the left – which, after all, represents millions of Britons – must stop accepting its continued media marginalisation as just one of those things. It isn’t – and it must change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724067c19a0adc99c9d836a169046263b6f8cb22/0_182_3541_2125/master/3541.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3b021ff166c834a4ca4a973fd61b3bae 1240w","title":"post industrial plymouth business social enterprise","story":"Down by the docks this post-industrial, post-imperial city is growing a new economy. The latest article in our new economics series explores how it took back control• Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastLooming over one of the poorest parts of Plymouth, which is to say one of the poorest parts of Britain, is a giant graveyard. Its buried are not men and women, but the carcasses of 13 nuclear submarines. Some have been dead for decades, such as the HMS Conqueror, which sank the Belgrano 36 years ago. Nine still have nuclear fuel rods, and there have been repeated leaks of radioactive waste. The Ministry of Defence claims all are safe. Then again, it sometimes doesn’t even disclose breaches until months later, when MPs and journalists have had to winch out the truth.All this runs true to local history. For nigh-on five decades, Devonport had its own Berlin Wall, with 50 acres of land walled up by the military. Complete with barbed wire running around the top, it was loathed by locals. It was only toppled in 2007. “The navy, the army, the air force: they come in, they do what they want, and take away the bits of the city they want for themselves,” says councillor Chris Penberthy, who grew up near the dockyard.“People do things to Plymouth,” he says. “Plymouth hasn’t often been allowed to do things for itself.” He is referring to the blitz, followed by the imposition of an Abercrombie city plan and the throwing up of shoddy housing. He also means the way in which well-meaning policy experts will today pitch up with some cash and pilot their brainwaves in Devonport and the impoverished west of the city. They come with a grand scheme to deal with household budgeting or child malnutrition and stay for a few months until the money runs out. Then they hurry off. A 60s baby, Penberthy grew up to the smell of Farley’s Rusks baking nearby. It joined Clarks’ shoes on a long rollcall of big local businesses. This is the Plymouth that residents liken to a northern mill town or a Welsh mining village. Just like them, the industry left decades ago. Just like them, it voted for Brexit.Representing the ward next door to Devonport, Penberthy sees ingrained deprivation in one of the richest countries in human history. Primary schools hold “brushing clubs” to help children look after their teeth, and “for some of those kids, aged eight or nine, it’ll be the first time they use a toothbrush”. Ahead of next month’s local elections, women on doorsteps say, “I vote how my husband tells me.” Families ripped off by the benefits office and bilked of desperately-needed cash for their disabled children sigh, “They must be right – they are the government.”What lends this even greater piquancy is Plymouth’s naval history, still celebrated in the breakfast rooms of a hundred lodging houses, with their paintings of Francis Drake on a bowling green. Before the dockyard became a radioactive burial ground, it employed tens of thousands of men. Today that figure is about 2,500.Post-industrial, post-imperial, post-Suez, Plymouth is no ordinary city it is a place where the furs in which Britain wraps itself are revealed as so many rags. Which makes what it does instead important not just locally but nationally. What it is doing is one of the most intriguing experiments I have seen in any British city. However far from perfect, it shows what can happen when a council tries to shape how business behaves in its backyard. It is what a city doing things for itself looks like. And it starts neither in the council chamber nor the city centre, but in a knackered hall in Devonport. Dotted across Devonport are the grand Regency buildings that remind visitors of its vast previous wealth and pre-1914 status as an independent town. Most imposing of all is the Guildhall, with its massive Doric pillars. By the mid-2000s, it had lain empty for years, being far too large for the now-shrunken local economy. Then, to councillors’ relief, along came a regional group called the Real Ideas Organisation (Rio).“The conversation began, ‘Do you think it needs to be a community centre, a business centre or an arts centre?’” recalls Rio chief executive Lyndsey Hall. “By the end, it was, ‘We don’t care what you do – just take it away.’” With a £1.75m grant, Hall did just that. Today, it’s not just a centre for community or business or arts: it’s all three – and more. “No one’s going to get rich out of running a building like this,” says Hall’s colleague Ed Whitelaw. “Why would any private company want to take it on?”But Hall and Whitelaw don’t run a standard business. Theirs is a social enterprise, a company that uses its profits and assets for public good. Rio derives an income from the Guildhall, but it doesn’t sweat the building for every last penny.To wander around the Guildhall is to see that ethos in action: the main hall with its stained-glass windows has just been vacated by a team of cheerleaders, and is let out for free to community groups. Other social enterprises rent office space and use the basement jail cells as meeting rooms. In the corner is a cafe and bakery.When the council met Rio in the late 2000s, social enterprises were still a novelty. Hall had been inspired by a visit to Toronto and seeing everything from supermarket chains to the giant Harbourfront arts centre operating as community businesses. But in the UK, social enterprises, or community interest companies, were only legally recognised in 2005. A product of fag-end Blairism, they came bearing that ideology’s virtues and vices: a desire to tackle age-old social problems in new ways and a bewildered wonderment at the magic that could somehow be worked by entrepreneurs. That haze hangs over the 2005 act, which establishes a watchdog for the new businesses – but says its “power should be exercised only to the extent necessary to maintain confidence in community interest companies”. As for how exactly communities were to be served by these companies – well, that was usually left for the companies themselves to define. Whether returning £10m or 10p to society – that’s up to them. “Some social enterprises we go, ‘brilliant, fabulous’,” says Rio’s Hall. “Other things named as social enterprises we go, ‘ugh’.”Yet consider the possibilities that a new form of entrepreneurship offers Plymouth, which faces the same huge challenge as numberless towns and cities across Britain and the west: how to get capital and power to stay local. One answer adopted by Chris Penberthy and the other Labour politicians voted in to lead the council in 2012 was to grow a different kind of business. The next year, Plymouth raced Bristol to become the first social enterprise city in the UK.“How do we grow our economy and grow ourselves a future? By finding companies who will do more than corporate social responsibility,” says Penberthy, who was put in charge of growing social enterprise in the city, a post then unknown to local government.“There was a lot of banging desks and ‘Do it now!’” recalls Alistair Macpherson, who worked at the council for years. In another municipal rarity, Penberthy set up a public fund to kickstart new social enterprises. More than largesse or political vision, this was a way for a local authority with dwindling budgets to fill in the gaps that big business wouldn’t touch.Those gaps are not just the dead buildings brought back to life by Rio, which is now at work on a £7m project to turn Devonport’s abandoned market hall into a high-tech centre for virtual reality. They’re also the solar farm that Macpherson built as head of Plymouth Energy Community on contaminated land next door to a bomb dump. And they’re in the city centre’s abandoned shops, such as the one now occupied by Moments Cafe which, as well as selling mugs of tea and ham omelettes, helps dementia sufferers and their carers. Run by nurse Kate Smith, the cafe’s staff has been trained to look out for memory problems or distress among customers.What drew Luke into the cafe was a sign reading “Memory Matters”. It was like a personal message. Last July, surgeons had removed a brain tumour by cutting out part of a lobe, and now he could no longer remember basic things, whether afternoon plans or people’s names. At the till he didn’t ask for a coffee: “I just wanted a number. A number for me to ring to speak about my memory.”Instead, Kate took him upstairs for a quiet chat – then it all came out. How the tumour meant he’d lost his building business and split from the mother of his four-year-old girl. How his head still hurt so much, despite all the heavy-duty meds. The attempts to kill himself. How the council had stuck him in a house-share with two other men, both threatening to beat him up. How he’d run away, with nowhere else to go. “I just bawled my eyes out,” says Luke, and not because of how much trouble he was in. “It was the acceptance from Kate. She listened and understood.”“You can’t leave him,” Smith remembers thinking to herself. “He’ll die.” So she lobbied council officers, drafted in support from Luke’s doctors, and got him a diary. Flip it open and the pages teem with Smith’s neatly written reminders to visit the hospital, phone the bank. It was a week’s work, reckons Smith. “And the rest,” laughs Luke. It paid off: he is now in a Travelodge while the council sorts out a permanent home. An amazing story, but it leaves you wondering why a just-opened cafe is picking up the pieces dropped by the NHS and the council – and whether tears over coffee and long hours ringing around a civic centre can ever form an actual business model. At the same time, it’s impossible to imagine such stories coming out of the mammoth Costa just a few doors down.Plymouth now has more than 150 social enterprises employing over 7,000 workers earning a combined income of over £500m. For a city of 250,000 people, which only adopted social enterprise five years ago, that’s remarkable growth. Even more surprising is the politics. Political control over Plymouth council changes only slightly less frequently than the tide, yet the Tory administration that took over in 2016 has also encouraged and funded social enterprise. If, as looks likely, Labour returns to power next month, it is committed to doubling the city’s co-operative economy by 2025. With neither side threatening to pull the plug, national charities such as Esmee Fairbairn and Power To Change have the security they need to plough millions into the city’s sector.To see what social enterprise could look like, walk 10 minutes west from Moments Cafe to yet another local graveyard. Once heaving with pubs and clubs, Union Street is now silent and shut. Yet inside The Clipper, once open all hours, Hannah Sloggett and Wendy Hart have plans to open a covered market and turn the two flats above into affordable homes for single fathers who lack the bedrooms for their visiting kids.I’m reminded of a remark from Rio’s Hall. “There was that moment on television when you’d have Alan Sugar doing The Apprentice and getting people to behave as badly as possible. Then an hour afterwards, it’d be The Secret Millionaire – with all these tycoons making people cry by giving them money out of the goodness of their hearts. “And that’s – that’s just wrong!” Her head crashes into her palms. “Why are we creating a culture where it’s OK to make money behaving as badly as possible in order for people to give it away? That’s the culture we’ve got to change. I don’t care whether it’s called social enterprise, or anything else.”Additional reporting by Tom Wright"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cba48983a7237209ceac302de8836f2f7657384/0_0_4284_2856/master/4284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5f70396211aff7daeb3391987f8b837f 1240w","title":"the guardian view on the bbc we should cherish and defend it","story":"It is easy to become frustrated with the BBC. On the right,\u0026nbspthe complaint has always been that the corporation\u0026nbspis an overmighty behemoth staffed by overpaid lefties. In more progressive circles, there has recently been anger over the time devoted to climate change deniers (such as Nigel Lawson) and pro-Brexit positions. A serious disparity between the salaries earned by male and female employees has been a justified focus of criticism. It is right to hold this publicly funded organisation to account it is right to pace the ramparts of\u0026nbspits impartiality\u0026nbspand independence. It is also right to keep a steady eye on what areas the BBC should operate in, and where it should draw back to allow other voices to flourish, whether they be local newspapers, the\u0026nbspnational press, or\u0026nbspindependent podcasts.Nevertheless, however tempting it may be in the moment to taunt it as the “Brexit Broadcasting Corporation” (or whatever the current anxiety may be), it is also right to take the long view of the BBC. That must surely mean defending its importance as a bastion of the UK’s democracy, culture and identity. The BBC was formed from a set of enlightened decisions taken during the birth pangs of broadcasting. In 1925, three years after the BBC was founded, the Crawford parliamentary committee took the view that the new wireless technology was so powerful and precious that on the one hand it ought not to be controlled by the state, and on the other, not abandoned to the market. And so the British Broadcasting Company became the British Broadcasting Corporation, to be run in the public interest. It would be financed by the licence fee rather than taxation, and so protected from the daily ebb and flow of party politics.If one considers the conditions of the world we live in now, these decisions look especially prescient. Today, this promise of broadcasting in the public interest means not commodifying your data against your will, or giving you fake news. The threats to democratic discourse presented by the filtering of information via the algorithms of multinational companies have become obvious. We are beginning to digest how politics (in Britain and overseas) may have been influenced by the use of data acquired on Facebook and elsewhere.This is bonanza time for audiences: never has there been so much high-quality material available to watch, whenever we like. But our voracious appetite for content should not blind us to the preciousness of the BBC, which has time and again over the years taken artistic risks to create brilliant, radical and innovative work that would be in the interests of no profit-driven private company. The corporation has, however, been assaulted in recent years. The decision by the former chancellor George Osborne to force the BBC to finance the licence fees of the over-75s – a cost previously borne by the government – was shortsighted. Whoever is in power at the moment of the next licence fee assessment must reverse Mr Osborne’s move to allow the BBC to make great programmes that will in turn enhance the reputation of the UK globally. As it is, this drain on the corporation’s finances (£750m by 2020-21) may presage its slow death, as the population ages and the BBC is harder pressed to fight off its rapidly consolidating American competitors.The BBC needs to greet the future with boldness. If the television is no longer the carrier of the public sphere that it once was, then what is? One answer is, of course, the internet. What if BBC engineers were to build a mechanism for structuring and shaping audience’s experiences of the web, in the public interest? That kind of thinking would take imagination, patience and creativity – not just from the BBC, but from the government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cba29ca28bf71b13abb8c58e3133b6355e44164e/0_0_620_375/master/620.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22c3327dd2b179a20ba671ee9a28f270","title":"critical gulf stream current weakest for 1600 years research finds","story":"Warm current that has historically caused dramatic changes in climate is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown and may be less stable than thought - with potentially severe consequencesThe warm Atlantic current linked to severe and abrupt changes in the climate in the past is now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years, new research shows. The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur.The current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current.Scientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches.“Amoc is a really important part of the Earth’s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,” said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought.The study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa.They also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. The second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so.The second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. However, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. “If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: “We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.”A 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: “Obviously it was exaggerated – the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e03bbd60797530ef17ee2396f14b22fc28f61e88/0_324_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4945b08b6e0b26b730216f5c6771747e 1240w","title":"rules working from home never wear pyjamas","story":"If you’re dressed for bed, your brain will think it’s bedtime. ‘Cheering’ tracksuit bottoms and slim-fit jumpers are far better for your home-working wardrobe, says our fashion guru in her weekly columnI’ve recently started to work from home. What should I wear?Sara, by emailAn excellent question and one I ask myself most days, because I generally work from home and while working from home does remove certain quandaries from your life – such as: “How long can I tolerate this commute until sweet death releases me?” and: “Sweet Jesus, how many times is Geoff from Accounts going to clear his throat, does he have a literal frog down there and, if so, can I go over and pull it out with my fist?” – others take their place. Nature, vacuum, etc.So while I no longer, thank goodness, have to endure the London tube every rush hour, I do find myself facing daily existential questions such as: “How do I stop myself from snacking from the fridge literally all goddamn day?” and: “If I’m not actually leaving the house, do I have to leave my bed?”Questions, questions. Clothing, of course, comes under this umbrella of new questions. Why bother to dress if you’re not going outside? To quote that famous philosophical saying, “If you wear an unironed shirt and no one sees it, was the shirt actually ironed?”The new homeworker tends to go through three phases with their clothes before settling down into something that works. The first is the pyjama phase, when you’re so excited about no longer having to go into an office that you celebrate by staying in your pyjamas for a day, three days, maybe five – what does it matter, right?But the thrill quickly wanes, partly because the postman starts giving you looks (and, as a homeworker, you will now be the drop-off depot for all of your neighbours’ Amazon, Asos, Argos, Ikea, Boots and John Lewis deliveries, so you will see an awful lot of your postman). But mainly because it starts to feel gross. Working in your pyjamas is a lot like working from bed (and the two often go together): it seems like such a great idea when you start, but you realise that if you’re dressed for bed, your brain will thinks it’s bedtime and totally fuzz out. So, not pyjamas is the first rule of homeworking.The next phase is when you react against pyjamas by dressing up – as if you’re going to work. This works for some people. Putting on a suit or smart dress gets them in the work mindset, I guess. I have a friend who likes to work from home in party dresses, as they make her feel like she is a) on it and b) having fun, even though she is sitting in her living room and knocking out more advertising copy.And that’s great – give that a go, see if it works for you. It absolutely never did for me. It just felt silly, as if I was some pathetic character in a movie, possibly one directed by the Coen brothers, who had been sacked and now sat at home in his suit, pretending nothing had happened.So, as I tend to do in all things, I go for the middle option (#centristhomeworker) and dress in clothes that are as comfortable as pyjamas but aren’t actually pyjamas. For me, this means cheering tracksuit bottoms, T-shirts, and slim-fitting jumpers. What do I mean by “cheering tracksuit bottoms”? Glad you asked! Ones that are not shapeless and depressing, but fit nicely, are colourful, and maybe even have rainbow stripes down the side. Asos.com is your answer here, and as you now work from home you’ll be there to accept its deliveries. I find that wearing a slim-fitting jumper – not a massive baggy thing that flops annoyingly over your hands when you’re typing – makes the tracksuit feel a little smarter so your brain doesn’t go into fuzz-out mode.As a kid, when I imagined my adult life, I sort of imagined myself as dressing like Melanie Griffith in Working Girl, striding around in a skirt suit. Instead, I sit around at home all day in a tracksuit. And because I’m such an adult, I’m good with that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205a67f3f8949727dc9932b0d90b4ede945dce2b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0a898cc55f68ad2a9b1ca7dcf371dd9a 1240w","title":"netflix pulls out cannes film festival","story":"Streaming giant says it hopes Cannes reconsiders after festival insists film premieres must receive French theatrical distributionNetflix will not bring any films to this year’s Cannes film festival after a new rule change.In an interview with Variety, the company’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said Netflix will not change its release strategy after Cannes insisted competing titles at the festival receive theatrical distribution in France. Of the company pulling out, Sarandos said: “It was not our decision to make.”Last year, Netflix brought Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories to the Croisette, which led to protests from French cinema owners. French law states that movies cannot be available on home platforms for 36 months after being shown in cinemas. This would directly conflict with Netflix’s day-on-date release for their films.This year, Thierry Fremaux, the festival’s artistic director, imposed a ban on movies competing for the main prizes without a theatrical release. Sarandos called the decision “completely contrary to the spirit of any film festival in the world”.Although Netflix could show films out of competition, Sarandos has claimed it would be unlikely. “We want our films to be on fair ground with every other film-maker,” he said. “There’s a risk in us going in this way and having our films and film-makers treated disrespectfully at the festival. They’ve set the tone. I don’t think it would be good for us to be there.”This year’s lineup is yet to be announced but Netflix removing films from consideration would mean new pictures from Alfonso Cuarón and Paul Greengrass would miss out.“We hope that they do change the rules,” Sarandos said. “We hope that they modernize. But we will continue to support all films and all film-makers. We encourage Cannes to rejoin the world cinema community and welcome them back.”Earlier on Wednesday, 2018’s official festival poster was released, before Thursday’s announcement of which films will be premiering. Everybody Knows, a psychological thriller from The Salesman director Asghar Farhadi, has been revealed as the opening film, while new projects from Lars von Trier, Claire Denis and Jacques Audiard are also predicted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18b85d2bea40b32204686cadb02d62239b509275/34_1152_4047_2428/master/4047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=950d40f0e00e38b92d7fc3740b3c278e 1240w","title":"nicolas cage joker batman gotham","story":"The very good, or very bad actor, depending on your tastes, has said that he would like to play Batman’s nemesis. Will the studios take the bait?If there were ever a Marmite actor, iding opinion equally between those who believe he is a maverick genius and those who see him as a giant ham, it is Nicolas Cage. When the part is right, as it was for Cage’s Oscar-winning role as a suicidal alcoholic in Mike Figgis’s Leaving Las Vegas, or as an unhinged cop in Werner Herzog’s mesmeric Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, he is one of the most watchable actors on the planet. When Cage goes too far out on a limb – one need hardly mention his infamous “The bees!” scene in Neil LaBute’s horrendous 2006 remake of The Wicker Man – it can feel as if he is not only appearing in a completely different movie from those around him, but perhaps inhabiting a parallel acting reality.At least Cage tries things – his decision to channel Adam West as vigilante Big Daddy in the comic book flick Kick-Ass was inspired, and helped mark that movie out from the crowd. The problem is that the things Cage tries are as likely to go wrong as right, and once they have done so there seems to be no off switch. That should perhaps lead us to view with caution the actor’s suggestion this week that he might make a decent Joker in an upcoming Batman movie.With apologies to the Fantastic Four super villain, it’s Cage’s suggestion that he might enjoy getting under the clown prince of Gotham’s skin that has grabbed most of the attention online. There appears to be little in the way of an opening right now at DC, with Jared Leto still inhabiting Batman’s nemesis for the DC Extended Universe movies and Joaquin Phoenix reportedly lined up to take the role in Todd Phillips’s upcoming Martin Scorsese-inspired Joker origin movie. But if DC studio Warner Bros is prepared to undermine Leto by casting another actor in a completely different take on the cackling supervillain, it should hardly be a stretch for studio execs to greenlight a third production.It’s not difficult to see why Cage is drawn to The Joker. For it ought, in theory, to be impossible to overact while playing the role. Not for a moment, we imagine, did Mark Hamill rein himself in while portraying the villain in the wonderful 90s TV show Batman: The Animated Series. Jack Nicholson hardly kept his powder dry for that pantomime turn in Tim Burton’s Batman (1989) and Heath Ledger  put everything on the table in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008). And yet there is a fear that a Cage Joker might sending the movie he appeared in into a ravine. The actor seems too risky a proposition to replace Leto in the DCEU movies, where an unwieldy performance might further derail a cinematic universe. His Doctor Doom would be intriguing, however, and there is space to try for a definitive take on the Fantastic Four’s nemesis. Fargo and Legion’s Noah Hawley is said to be working on an origins story for the supervillain – though it’s unclear whether that production is likely to survive the character’s imminent move from Fox to Disney.It’s hard to imagine the big cheeses at Marvel casting Cage, given the actor’s propensity for eccentric decision-making and the MCU’s episodic nature. Cage as Doom might well become a highlight of the cinematic universe. But it’s just as likely that the star of the Ghost Rider movies would do something characteristically brave and daft at the same time, like deciding to play the part in unwieldy homage to Bela Lugosi (in tribute to Doom’s eastern European origins). That’s something I’m sure we’d all pay good money to see – once. But the novelty might well wear off after another 13 episodes.

That is no surprise but what is a surprise is that for so much of a dramatic, nervous night at the Bernabéu it looked like they might not be.A round of shocks almost had the biggest of them all, a miracle mighty close, the champions following Barcelona in being knocked out by Italian opposition. In Turin they had been applauded, Cristiano Ronaldo holding his heart in gratitude after his superb goal was handed an ovation at the Bernabéu there were hands on hearts too, in agony, right to the end. And then Ronaldo appeared once more.Juventus took Madrid to the cliff edge with a 3-0 lead with two from Mario Mandzukic and one from Blaise Matuidi. Until, into the third minute of added time, Lucas Vázquez went down under a challenge from Medhi Benatia. The referee, Michael Oliver, pointed to the spot. As Juventus’s players surrounded him, seeing hope slip away, screaming injustice, Gigi Buffon was sent off, his last European game ending with him walking from the field, angry and unmoved by the ovation.And so a place in the semi-finals came down a penalty: the world watching, Ronaldo waiting, the substitute goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny eventually standing before him. One shot. It flew high into the net, Ronaldo raced to the corner flag, throwing his shirt in the air, the stadium erupting, barely able to believe it. Juventus couldn’t, either. The roar was delight and relief.Fear had visited Madrid fans early, a realisation there was a game on, one they had never anticipated, despite the warnings. It never really let go. Douglas Costa played in Sami Khedira, running in on the right, and he clipped the cross to the far post where Mandzukic arrived and headed in the opener. The clock said 1:16: it was the quickest goal Madrid had conceded in this competition and it was just the start. An hour and a half later, this had still not been resolved: a tie that had appeared over a week ago was not yet done.Less than 30 seconds after the goal, Juventus were back: the celebration high in the north end had barely subsided and the rallying call from the rest of the ground had hardly been raised when Gonzalo Higuaín was there, deep inside the area. He was slow, the shot scuffed and the chance wasted, but the storm had not passed. Mattia De Sciglio delivered two crosses in a minute and then Costa, who tore into them throughout, raced into the area, forcing Keylor Navas to e at the feet of Higuaín.All this had happened inside seven minutes and although Gareth Bale forced a save from Buffon two minutes later, Dani Carvajal then bursting through and Isco having one ruled out for offside, the ordeal continued. Carvajal had to clear Mandzukic’s delivery and the resulting corner went through to the Croat, bouncing off his shins and into Navas’s hands from five yards. This was relentless it was also only 15 minutes in and yet there could have been three or four already.Still the chances came at both ends. Higuaín shot over, Toni Kroos was blocked and Isco curled wide. Madrid had wrested some control, a little breathing room. Or so it seemed. A minute after Buffon was out to save from Isco, Juventus got the second. De Sciglio had been forced off but the supply from the right was not cut. Stephan Lichtsteiner this time curled to Mandzukic to head home. At the other end, Raphaël Varane’s header thumped back off the bar on the stroke of half‑time.As the players departed, so Vázquez and Asensio came out to warm up. “I had to change something,” Zinedine Zidane, the Madrid manager, said. But Juventus continued on the front foot, led by Costa, immediately curling over.Juventus were one goal from extra time and on the hour they got it, when Navas dropped a long, deep and largely inoffensive cross at the feet of Blaise Matuidi, who scrambled it over the line.Level on aggregate and away goals too, the psychological and tactical advantage was Juve’s. That situation also created doubts, though: they had something to lose now and a decision to make: look for the goal now or later? Madrid, in part, shared that: 20 minutes now, or 30 minutes later? With each passing minute, that question became more pertinent, the balance tilting towards extra time, the margins finer, the tension and the risks greater. If, that is, they could even choose. Max Allegri, Juve’s manager, later implied he preferred the security of 30, but in the end he never got it.Ronaldo’s deflected shot squeezed wide, Jesús Vallejo blocked Khedira, Buffon scrambled to save from Isco and Ronaldo shot just wide, then headed over with five minutes left. This was not over yet but there would be less time left than anyone thought. When Vázquez went over in the last minute, the whole match, 180 extraordinary minutes, was reduced to one moment.Time passed, tension grew, a simple end for a chaotic occasion. “My heart rate went up but I calmed myself because I knew it would be decisive,” Ronaldo said. On a night of nerves, he showed none."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d95c5595156d462e812d4969f0ca036eeeec31d/133_106_2245_1347/master/2245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bc1d63eb6d9d8c4862c6a04ae8262f5a 1240w","title":"sunderland newcastle fans celebrate relegation stadium of light","story":"• Supporters seek to gloat over rivals’ plight at Stadium of Light• Sunderland to have no cash turnstiles for final gamesSunderland have taken discreet steps to prevent gleeful Newcastle fans from turning up at the Stadium of Light and mocking Chris Coleman’s struggling side during their final two home games of the season.With Sunderland looking certain to drop into League One, chatter on social media and fans forums suggested Newcastle fans had planned to attend the home matches against Burton and Wolves in order to gloat.Aware of this Sunderland – seemingly bound for a second successive relegation – had no cash turnstiles open for Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Norwich and are expected to do likewise for their next two home fixtures.In 1987, when the Wearsiders were demoted to the third tier for the first time in their history, more than 1,000 Newcastle fans appeared at Roker Park to cheer on Gillingham during the play-off second leg which they won on away goals, consigning Sunderland to the old Third Division.In order to prevent a repeat, tickets for the Burton and Wolves games will have to be bought through the ticket office where staff are likely to insist on evidence of a history of attending games at the Stadium of Light. This policy should screen out mischief-making Newcastle supporters.With Sunderland’s crowds having dropped sharply – (a crowd of only 24,894 attended the Norwich game at a ground which averaged well over 40,000 a match during its decade in the Premier League) – it represents a fairly drastic measure. Yet although relations between fans of the rival north-east clubs have improved significantly in recent years, seats were smashed during a Tyne-Wear altercation at an under-23 game at Sunderland last month.Six points adrift of fourth-bottom Bolton, Coleman’s team are second bottom of the Championship and have only four matches in which to save themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa7acb47f1a7d8a7f794104d2313e4107555b121/247_53_3510_2107/master/3510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b1f8a9aa91bf56cf4c035d79053b29b1 1240w","title":"wolves derby county championship match report","story":"If this is the game that moves Wolves to within touching distance of the Championship title, then it will also be remembered as the night Rúben Neves scored a goal worthy of any champions.The Portugal playmaker volleyed his latest majestic strike into the top corner from 30 yards as Nuno Espírito Santo’s team moved to within one result of a return to the Premier League.Wolves will seal promotion if they beat Birmingham at home on Sunday lunchtime, or the evening before should Fulham falter against Brentford. Moving on to 92 points, they have already gained their record haul at this level and, 11 points clear, could also be anointed champions on Sunday.Derby’s promotion plans have for some time been restricted to holding on to their play-off berth and, even after successive victories before Wednesday night, they are not bankers in fifth place.Neves converted a brilliant free-kick to secure victory at Cardiff last Friday and has scored six long-range goals this season. Signed for £15.6m from Porto last summer, the 21-year-old midfielder has lived up to his billing and Gary Rowett believes he belongs not only in the Premier League but at the top end of it.“That’s almost the first time I’ve applauded an opposition goal,” the Derby manager said. “It’s Champions League stuff, not just Championship. He’s a Champions League player. That’s what you get when you spend nearly £16m. At 21, when you play with that much control … For me, he should be playing for one of the top-four clubs in the country. They’re like a Premier League side but our season’s not going to be defined by games against Wolves.”Wolves’ home form has been almost serenely consistent all season. They have lost once in 21 league matches at Molineux and will be relishing Sunday’s derby.“We are close,” Nuno said. “We have to play on Sunday. Nothing changes, nothing changes. We have to prepare well. The game on Sunday means a lot to our fans, to us. We have to be very cautious.Wolves set about Derby with panache and were ahead within six minutes. Diogo Jota timed his run perfectly to latch on to Willy Boly’s angled lofted pass and get beyond the backline. Even then he had his back to goal but the Portuguese winger took the ball down with one touch, turned and calmly lifted it over Scott Carson.Neves dispatched two wonderful strikes that Carson could only parry during the first half but there was no stopping the goal that arrived on the day Wolves closed the voting for their goal of the season competition.When Barry Douglas’s corner was cleared by Chris Baird, Neves appeared to miscontrol the ball for a moment. But perhaps he was just teeing himself up. For his next touch was a right-foot volley from 30 yards that flew into the top corner. It was a remarkable goal from a remarkable player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92c2040450e90595d4ebff44350fff3fe356a5d4/298_118_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=df3a533c236e932a552f33f6ded07eb6 1240w","title":"pep guardiola manchester city three straight defeats champions league exit","story":"After three straight defeats, City’s manager is not ‘a fraud’ and neither has he been ‘found out’ – rather rivals have realised how to exploit his side’s weak spotsIs Pep Guardiola a bald fraud? Before Manchester City’s three consecutive defeats in the last eight days, this seemed to be one of the more urgent questions of the modern sporting age.It looked a simple enough dichotomy. Is the man who gave us the most compelling elite club team and the finished‑article Lionel Messi, a high‑class manager whose teams retain a skein of brittleness against the best opponents? Or is he, in fact, a fraud. And not just a fraud but a bald fraud. A bald foreign fraud, the worst kind of fraud there is.Things have moved on in the past few days, glossed by the elimination from the Champions League on Tuesday at the hands of a fine, compact, ice‑cold Liverpool team. The public appear to have spoken. An internet search for the phrases “bald fraud” and “Pep Guardiola” over the past seven days produces a decisive, clinching 4,700 matches, even if many of those relate to an article by the otherwise excellent journalist Ken Early openly denying – imagine! – that Guardiola is a bald fraud.Before the first-leg defeat by Liverpool, these same search numbers were down in the one‑thousands. And frankly the data doesn’t lie. The question is no longer, whether Guardiola is a bald fraud. It is instead: how long has he been a bald fraud? And how was European football, with all its misleading facts and data and elements of obvious beauty so easily tricked out of its jewels, its virtue and its timeshare in Alicante by this handsome egg-headed swindler?There is of course another point of view. Stepping away from the tribal blurts of received footballing opinion, it is possible the bald fraud narrative is an oversimplification. Football has always loved its pig‑headed certainties, its binary shades, although it is a relatively new idea that successful, confident, (foreign) people are no longer allowed just to lose but must instead be “found out”, exposed, stripped bare of their fanciness.The main point here is that sticking to this narrative also misses the best bits of City’s recent struggles. Not to mention the deeper fascination of how Guardiola, who is actually pretty good at coaching football teams, might adapt to an effective, considered response to his team’s frictionless domination of the first three-quarters of the season.The first point is obvious enough. Other football managers are also allowed to be clever, adaptive, resourceful people at the top of their profession. If Jürgen Klopp and José Mourinho have found a way to interfere with the fine‑point machinery of Guardiola’s team, this does not naturally mean his life’s work is meaningless, his trophies the tarnished baubles of a cosseted\u0026nbspprinceling.City fans have already been quick to point to bad luck (Leroy Sané’s disallowed goal at the Etihad Stadium) and to the fact anyone can lose in knockout football as evidence that nothing has really changed. The truth, as ever, is somewhere in between. Something different has clearly been happening in the past three games and in the last 10, five of which have been lost.The basic statistics from those three defeats make for interesting reading. City dominated every metric, as is so often the case. In defeat to Liverpool (twice) and Manchester United they had more corners (23 to six combined) more shots (51 to 19) and – of course – more possession of the ball. Across those 270 losing minutes City made a staggering 1,778 accurate passes to their opponents’ 799, an average of three and a half more accurate passes every minute of every game.This was not all cold possession or meaningless sideways passing. City were still pressing forward and making chances. And yet on the one metric that matters they lost by a combined score of 8-3, to opponents who for long periods appeared comfortable sitting out that familiar sky blue weather front.So what has changed? There are two obvious answers. The balance of play was exactly the same as in two big games City won earlier in the season against Manchester United and Arsenal – but with one exception. City also dominated the dribbling numbers in those previous games, whereas in their last three games they were out-dribbled every time, with City players dribbled past four or five more times on each\u0026nbspoccasion.This is not a random stat. It chimes with the wider sense of a shift of attitude, a change in the way City’s opponents have been prepared to play without the ball, knowing they also have a way to attack. For most of what was in the end a comfortable two‑leg victory Liverpool sat and waited without seeming rushed or panicked, a team prepared to see not having the ball as an opportunity, a chance to strike from deep at what can be a fragile defence.Again this is not a magic bullet. City have not been “exposed”. But all managers study their opponents for weaknesses and while Nicolás Otamendi, in particular, has improved under Guardiola he was also reduced to a cartwheeling funk every time Mohamed Salah ran in his\u0026nbspdirection.Hence those dribble stats. Hence Manchester United’s controlled, driving aggression in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. Perhaps there was a clue in Crystal Palace’s performance at Selhurst Park on New Year’s Eve, when Roy Hodgson sent his team out to press aggressively and isolate Wilfried Zaha against City’s defenders, producing their biggest test to date.Again there is nothing in this that requires anyone to be shamed or retrospectively stripped of their achievements. Guardiola’s excellence brought some studied excellence in response from Hodgson – and now from Klopp and Mourinho. The league is improved by this process, our entertainment improved and given shape.The most interesting question now is how Guardiola will respond. Elements of English football have been desperate for him to fail and to fail in exactly this way to be exposed as lazy and vain, an Improper Football Man, all foreign-accented short cuts and dossier-fondling privilege.Let’s face it, he ticks some pretty hot boxes, from the basic offence of being both foreign, successful and arrogant, to deeper issues of method and attitude, of a notably academic, theorising approach.The easy response would be to go out and buy players good enough to implement those ball-playing tactics without weaknesses, players so good the system will always work. It will be fascinating to see how he plays it, whether he tinkers with his own setup or looks to surprise his opponents in turn, as he did in varying methods at Bayern Munich, or simply coaching what he has to more and better of the same.Defeat will always leave Guardiola open to the taunts of the bald-fraud squad. In reality, to lose this way, still hammering at the same door, lost in his own methods, is simply a part of his appeal, those draining, quixotic defeats another layer to the pleasure his teams can bring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e88e2a96f5ced97e8d9f34018ec2b980e1df321/0_107_3496_2098/master/3496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=74daf0b79c973d611f01469c4b23c224 1240w","title":"real madrid juventus champions league quarter final live","story":"Real have escaped into the semi-finals!

Ramos, by the way, is now sitting in the Real dugout minus his hat. Are they going to slip in to a jersey and try to sneak him on? That might work if they hadn’t made all their substitutes already. OK, it wouldn’t work. 89 min: Real are in charge in terms of territory now, but Juve are defending reasonably comfortably. They love this. And they know that if they can nick one more goal on the counter, Real will need to score twice...88 min: Marcelo loops a useless cross into the box. Ronaldo tries to make something of it but jumps and falls to the ground like an uncoordinated pogo dancer. It’s as if last week never happened.87 min: Carvajal curls a cross in from the right, much like Lichtsteiner’s delivery to Mandzukic in the first half. But Ronaldo is no Mandzukic tonight - he donks his header over the bar.86 min: Pjanic takes the freekick quickly and tries to play in Mandzukic. but the Croat wasn’t expecting that move. 86 min: Vallejo booked for clattering into Higuain. Freekick to Juve from nearly 30 yards, dead centre. Pjanic has scored from here before ...84 min: This is taut. Every challenge is intensely contested and both sides are thinking twice about taking risks that could prove fatal. 82 min: Juve relieve the pressure by finding Costa, who sprints past Marcelo before being hacked down by the Brazilian. An obvious yellow card. 80 min: The home crowd are becoming a little more buoyant, in response to a spell of pressure rom their team. Varane goes close when the ball breaks to him in the box and he sends a sidefooter just wide of the target.79 min: Isco lets fly from 20 yards. Benatia tries to block but his deflection makes matters more difficult for Buffon, who springs to his right and touches the ball around the post!78 min: Marcelo hares down the left but his cross is easily cleared at the near post by Benatia. 76 min: Sandro pumps the ball into the Real box rom the left. Real hastily whack it away. But it soon comes back and Juve have a corner ...74 min: Ronaldo scurries into the Juve box from the left wing. There is a forest of bodies in front of him but he essays a shot - and it’s deflected just wide.72 min: Pjanic juggles with the ball in the centre circle before spinning away and setting up another attack. But Real win the ball back and start a counter, which Costa brings to an abrupt end by lunging at Asensio. That’s a deserved yellow card.70 min: There is a lull, as both team consider their next moves. Question: if Juventus win this, does Ronaldo’s goal in the first leg become less great?69 min: To answer a question posed by several of you: if the scores remain the same at 90 minutes, this tie will proceed to extra-time, and potentially a penalty shootout. You’d have to fancy the team with Buffon if it goes that far. 68 min: Freekick to Real in a dangerous position, a couple of yards outside the area and to the right. Ronaldo allows Asensio to do the honours and the younger man curls a shot several yards over the bar.62 min: Real don’t seem to know quite what to do. Juve, in contrast, look very measured: they haven’t had to work up a storm to get back into this tie. Rather they have been controlled, attacking only at the right times and to devastating effect.61 min: The camera keeps picking out Ramos, who is sitting in the posh seats with a smart hat. Real are almost visibly pining for him on the pitch.Unbelievable! Costa curled in a cross from the left. It should have been easy pickings for Navas but the goalkeeper dropped it at the feet of Matuidi, who didn’t pause to say thank you: he just flipped the ball into the net and wheeled away to celebrate with ecstatic team-mates! This is historic! 59 min: Modric loses possession in his own half. Matuidi begins a Juve attack, which culminates with Higuain having a shot on the swivel from 20 yards. It lacks power but still demands an awkward save from Navas. 57 min: After a spell of slow possession lay by Real, Vazquez bursts own the right wing and picks out Ronaldo with a low pass. Ronaldo fires off a low shot from the edge of the area. Buffon gets down to save. It has, by the way, been seven years since since Real failed to score at home in a European match. 55 min: A sloppy pass by Matuidi gives the ball to Real, who have a chance to break forward. But they do not commit many players to the attack, such is their wariness. The move peters out. 54 min: Carvajal goes down holding his nose, trying to fool the referee into believing he’s been elbowed in the gob by Mandzukic, who, in reality, merely brushed against him with a fair shoulder challenge. The referee awards a freekick. Even that seems severe. 53 min: Ronaldo tries to take charge of matters all by himself. He goes on a run that that takes him into the Juve box. He nudges the ball past the last defender and goes around him to collect it. but Chiellini gets a cross to block the shot at the expense of a corner.51 min: The crowd are becoming increasingly edgy - because Real’s players appear to be. They keep giving the ball away. “I’m stuck in an airport that must be the only place in the world not showing this game, Paul” frets Justin Kavanagh. “If Juventus do pull off The Miracle in Madrid, it is your solemn duty to describe the look on Ronaldo’s puss as he walks off. There will be a wibbly lower lip, at least!” I’m assuming you’re in Madrid airport, right?48 min: Costa collects a pass to feet and dart past Marcelo, who ed in. He bears down on the box and then decides to unload with a left-footer from 20 yards. But he skies it.47 min: Asesnsio skips down the left and plays in Vazquez, who ties to glide past Chiellini in the box. But Juve’s defence stands firm. “Looking at this potential comeback, I can’t help but think of Marca’s gleeful front page from this morning, with both Barca and Pep labelled as ‘total failures’,” notes Shaun Wilkinson. “What do you think they are going to go with tomorrow if Juve get one more?” Traffic news?46 min: Zidane is not about to tolerate what happened in the first half. He’s made two changes for the second: Vazquez and Asensio on, Bale and Casemiro off. The first half completely passed Bale by and he’s not being given a chance to make amends.Here are Real’s biggest ever home defeats in Europe’s premier competition. Juve are going to have to inflict a record beating: 2-4 v Bayern Munich in 2000. 1-3 v Spartak Moscow in 1991At half-time Juve are two-thirds of the way to an outlandish comeback! They have not dominated in the way that Roma did against Barcelona last night but they have played smart and taken their chances emphatically. Mandzukic is tormenting Real’s defenders in the air and will fancy his chances of bagging a hat-trick: the biggest question, probably, is whether Juve can stop Real from scoring. We have ourselves a bona fide cliffhanger! 45 +1 min: Ronaldo slips out on the left wing. Chiellini spots an opportunity to nick the ball but Ronaldo puts his body in front of it and wins a freekick. Kross curls it in. Varane jumps to get a header to it from seven yards .. and the ball canons back off the crossbar! 44 min: Isco leads a break forward. after scampering for 40 yards he nips a pass in to Ronaldo at the left-hand corner of the Juve box. Ronaldo shakes and shimmies but that don’t impress Benatia much: the Moroccan steps in and relives the Portuguese of the ball. He’ll be aiming to reprise that at this summers World Cup. 42 min: Juve rumble forward again. Khedira tries to thread a cute pass through to Mandzukic, but Varane reads it and intercepts well. “Wonder how much this game will be decided by subtitutes,” parps Alexander Scrutton. “While Juventus do not really have much firepower of the bench other than maybe Cuadrado, Madrid have got players such as Asensio, Vazquez and Benzema. Could they decide the game?” Yes, they could. But will they? At the moment the key from a Real viewpoint is that Ramos is missing: without him Real’s defence look extremely fragile in the air, certainly no match for Mandzukic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc568cb780dd17e9133f0ecc929c99d7934bb798/0_273_4389_2633/master/4389.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0cdfaacfaa0c5ceb07e61a778b4ac1a7 1240w","title":"eu moves ban sale lower quality branded food eastern europe","story":"Studies suggest hundreds of well-known products are inferior to versions sold in the west Brussels wants to make it illegal for food and drink multinationals to sell inferior versions of well-known brands to customers in eastern Europe, after studies suggested hundreds of products were involved in the practice.An EU directive banning so-called “dual food” was announced on Wednesday following longstanding complaints from member states in central and eastern Europe.Coca-Cola, Pepsi, HiPP baby food, Birds Eye, Lidl and Spar have denied accusations of selling lower quality goods in the east bearing identical branding to products sold in western Europe. Persil and Ariel have been accused of selling a less effective washing product formula in eastern Europe, a claim they also refute.The European commission will next month provide member states with a methodology for testing multinational brands, so that the real culprits can be identified. Funding has also been committed.Company response: “The tastes and consumer wishes are different in each country and we try to fulfil consumer wishes.”Test result:\u0026nbspMeat in German can was found to be pork, while Czech product was mechanically extracted poultry meat.Company response: “The two products mentioned are different products. Yes, the products look a bit like each other at first glance, but they are not at all similar – different layout, different recipes. The German\u0026nbspFrühstücksfleish\u0026nbspis a completely different recipe than the Czech and Slovenian luncheon meat.”Company response: It said its recipes for fish fingers were adapted to local tastes but they were all made in Germany, including those sold in the UK.Test result:\u0026nbspFructose-glucose syrup and 11.2g of sugar in bottle sold in Slovenia, compared with 10.6g of sugar in Austria.Company response: “We occasionally slightly adapt our beverages to meet local consumer tastes and preferences, to source local ingredients or to follow local regulation.”However, Věra Jourová, the most senior justice official at the European commission, who is responsible for consumer affairs, said central and eastern European governments, including in her home state, the Czech Republic, needed to see explicit legislation outlawing the practice, which has now been drafted.Jourová said she had faced resistance from industry and western member states who incorrectly believed the EU was seeking to harmonise food products.She said: “The industry is nervous ... There is some misunderstanding between some parts of Europe that the problem is not that serious. Colleagues in trade and industry had legitimate concerns that we must not open the Pandora’s box but I think we have come forward with a proportionate solution.“We are not dictating tastes. I am not touching Danish herrings, I am not touching Czech sausages. If there exists a brand that is marketed in many member states, there is legitimate expectation that the brand will contain the same thing, and it doesn’t in cases ... My estimation remains the same – several hundreds of products.”She added: “I am not friendly towards legislation when there are other ways to do the same thing. But I have received very clear responses from the member states that they want to see this in legislation.”Products with different recipes, but bearing the same branding, will only be allowed on sale if the food company can prove that the taste preferences in one part of Europe differ from those in another area.The food industry has for years insisted that differences between similarly branded products can be explained by a desire to satisfy cultural preferences, rather than to cut costs.The action against the “dual food” problem was among a series of efforts to increase consumer confidence announced in Brussels.Jourová said: “In a globalised world where the big companies have a huge advantage over inidual consumers, we need to level the odds. Consumer authorities will finally get teeth to punish the cheaters. It cannot be cheap to cheat.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614ab9187e1f0812d59414376c856f1cf85ccfa8/0_224_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1a06b1ef8afd902fbba3643f2a3a1141 1240w","title":"supported living scheme misleading residents block plan","story":"In this series Poppy Noor discusses an issue concerning how we can build happy, well-run communities. But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesRecently, I came home to find posters plastered over my block of flats, warning of a new development that would affect us all, urging me to come to a meeting. The meeting was held by some neighbours who told us the development would not be fit for purpose and would make the area unsafe. They tried to rally us around the fact that we weren’t consulted on the development, which the people I live with were very moved by. When pressed, the residents explained that this supposedly sinister development would be a supported living development for people with learning disabilities. Their reasoning against it seemed strange – mainly that they thought people with learning disabilities weren’t suited to communal living and the building would make the street darker and thus more prone to antisocial behaviour.Something strikes me as odd about this campaign. The residents live in a posh part of the area that isn’t really affected by redevelopment. The building is being built over a car park that belongs to the council, and an estate agents. The residents have been trying to block the development since its proposal, which they knew about first because it would directly back on to their gardens. I am concerned that they are trying to mislead us, but I seem to be the only one. How can I find out the truth?What concerns me most about this discussion is that there was no disability rights voice at the meeting. It is not OK for this group of residents to make statements about what is right for an entire community without involving them in the discussion. Don’t fall into the trap of doing the same. Contact a local disability action group. They are likely to know the needs within the local area and community, and can advise you on the statements being made. They probably already know about this development and the objections. If not, it is important they do, so they can add their voice to the discussion and challenge your neighbours if their motives are as sinister as you suspect.You have told me this will be a council building. In that case, a quick online search will lead you to the document that summarises the proposal for the development, and the name of the employee dealing with it. Call your council and ask to speak to the planning officer about the reasoning behind it, and any equalities impact assessments they have done, including consultation of relevant local communities. Local councillors in these situations can be a goldmine of information. If the development is not in your ward, make sure you contact the councillor(s) of the affected ward as well as your own. Try to get a rounded opinion – speaking to politicians from all sides will hopefully give you an idea of any tensions over the development, and perhaps about the campaign group.I have spoken to a planner working in a similar area who recommends writing to the council once you have done your research. They can tell you what the status of the application is and if it is still being consulted on – the decision maker will have to take all consultation responses into account. Even if the process is over, you should still make your views known. You should also ask to be kept informed. I don’t know what stage of the process the application is at, but with enough objections, it could be passed on to a committee of councillors to decide on its future. If that’s the case, you are entitled to attend the meeting to speak in favour of the application (or indeed against).These residents rounded you up because they thought you should be consulted. Trust your nose – you have done some good detective work here. But make sure you hold them to it by staying involved and challenging them if they really are fearmongering.• What do you think?

Updated UK package travel regulations, part of an EU directive due to take effect for holidays booked from 1 July, aim to create a level playing field by making online retailers as responsible for consumer protection as traditional travel agents.An estimated 45m overseas holidays are taken each year by Britons, of which 20m are conventional package holidays with flights, coach or rail travel which are primarily protected by Abta. But 3m so-called “flight-plus” arrangements which have until now had lesser protection will be brought into the safety net. Flight-plus is a holiday booking where a flight departing the UK and accommodation andor car hire are booked at the same time or within a day, but where the way in which it is sold means it is not a package holiday. These will no longer exist under the package travel regulations and instead could form part of a package or a linked travel arrangement.“When we book a package holiday we expect it all to go according to plan, but if a company goes bust it can ruin more than just the holiday, leaving people out of pocket or even stranded,” said the consumer minister, Andrew Griffiths. “These new rules mean that internet explorers can book their holidays online, secure in the knowledge they will be compensated in the same way as someone who booked their holidays through a travel agent if something does go wrong.”Mark Tanzer, the chief executive of Abta, said: “More holiday travel arrangements will be classified as packages, meaning greater protection for these types of holiday. “Package holidays offer the best form of protection not only are you entitled to a refund or to be brought home should your travel company go out of business, but you also benefit from additional legal protection – for example, the right to a refund if bad weather means your holiday can’t be provided.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23b33e0c1d46b82eb2bba02406f570bf6230b6fd/0_149_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6d8d2cc5557d5b6b709a9aa7454e3df4 2600w","title":"bernie sanders jeremy corbyn labour for the many","story":"A visit to one of the US socialist’s rallies inspired former Labour strategist Steve Howell. In an exclusive extract from his new book, he writes about the power of storytelling and the eureka moment behind the party’s 2017 campaign sloganAs Jeremy Corbyn was campaigning to be Labour leader for the first time in 2015, something unprecedented was happening in the US: a democratic socialist was emerging as a serious contender for the presidency. Never in US political history had someone labelling themselves with the “S” word been more than a fringe candidate.Hillary Clinton had name recognition, huge resources, and the backing of the entire Democrat establishment. However, she had alienated many grassroots Democrat supporters with her backing for regime-change wars and trade deals that had decimated entire industries and destroyed thousands of jobs.Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, had voted against the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and was challenging her with a campaign platform that – like Corbyn’s – zeroed-in on growing wealth inequality. Sanders reiterated that core message in rally after rally through the summer and autumn of 2015. And it soon became clear he was striking a chord with voters.By 2016 I wanted to see what it was like to #FeelTheBern. And I was not disappointed. The rally I attended – on 4 June, on the concourse of the Los Angeles Coliseum – was slickly organised. Staff and volunteers managed security as more than 13,000 people queued patiently to pass through the barriers. There were three hours of music and speeches by Hollywood A-listers – among them Rosario Dawson, Shailene Woodley, Max Carver and, my own favourite, 90-year-old Dick Van Dyke “giving a young politician a hand-up” by leading a “we love you, Bernie” sing-along. By the time Sanders made his entrance, the event was all over Twitter and the anticipation was huge. Flanked by his wife, Jane, and his children and grandchildren, he spoke from a lectern decorated with a US flag and the campaign’s “a future to believe in” strapline, and stuck to a text that embodied the arguments he had been repeating at every single rally for months. There was no message-creep and no need for him to shout – every word would be of broadcast quality for mainstream media and live streaming online.Afterwards I was not alone among Corbyn’s supporters in reflecting on what Labour could learn from the Sanders campaign. Not only was there considerable common ground on policy, they were both “anti-establishment” politicians who had the authenticity and credibility, on the one hand, to counter the rightwing populism of Donald Trump and Nigel Farage and, on the other, to inspire and mobilise young people on a scale not seen for a generation.However, importing ideas from another country, even one with a nominally common language, is a hazardous business. Some ideas do not travel well. Sometimes good ideas are dismissed because of where they have come from.When Bill Clinton emerged to win the 1992 presidential election, the Labour modernisers fell in love with American politics. They saw Clinton’s “new” Democrats, with their focus on appealing to middle-class aspiration, as the model for New Labour. The one thing they expressly did not acquire from Clinton was his liking for campaign rallies. Bill is a charming and engaging orator who loves a big crowd, but New Labour had a strong aversion to political rallies, dismissing them as preaching to the converted. Which is all very well if the media is on your side, but for politicians challenging the status quo, every opportunity to speak to large numbers of people directly is like gold dust.Sanders had made a virtue of necessity in building his campaign around big rallies that were welcoming to people new to politics. Looking back on it afterwards, he wrote: “A rally of thousands of people standing together … is something unforgettable and extraordinarily powerful. It is not something that a television ad can accomplish.”The rallies were a generator that powered all the other elements, creating virtuous circles of highly charged activity. Videos would be shared far and wide on social media. New volunteers signed up at rallies would be trained to go out canvassing. Contact details collected would be used to disseminate campaign materials and raise money online.Mass fundraising from small donors was one of the stand-out features of the Sanders campaign. At the outset, he had decided that “you cannot take on the establishment if you take their money.” Sanders was also adept at using social media, despite personally being a novice.But he was not dismissive of conventional methods. He had used paid-for radio, television and print advertising in numerous previous election campaigns and believed it still played an important role. In his bid for the presidency, as his support grew, he was able to compete with Clinton on paid advertising. By the end, the Sanders campaign had spent more than $100m on media buying. What distinguished his use of a conventional medium, however, was the way his ads – in both their imagery and words – were mainly about people and their stories. While the Clinton campaign was running traditional candidate messages, focusing on her political record, the Sanders ads were – as marketing agency executives put it – “tapping into what people are feeling” and offering “a deeper sense of idealism”.At Westminster, as the end of March 2017 approached, the inspiring Sanders rally I had gone to felt very distant. The local elections were looming. Campaign materials had to be produced within a matter of days, and our plans to get a policy bandwagon rolling had been delayed by the horrific Westminster Bridge attack. In the discussions with Southside, Labour’s head office near Victoria, during that period, there was much rolling of eyes when I offered some thoughts on how we should campaign in the local elections. I had half-expected my references to the Sanders campaign to be dismissed, and they were (“he lost,” I was told), but I had not bargained for the amusement use of the phrase “narrative arcs” would cause.Storytelling has been used in marketing communications for years, simply because it is how most of us talk to each other most of the time – we tell people about things that have happened to us or others and then we might discuss what we feel or think about them. Conversation is mainly storytelling. And so is the best political communication, which is why some of the Sanders videos were so effective, and why the leader of the opposition’s office – known by the acronym Loto – had already accepted a kind offer from the film director Ken Loach to use his skills.But this goes wider than how you produce a video. The whole campaign needed to tell the same story – an overarching narrative that voiced people’s fears, frustrations and hopes, and described a road to a better future. In a dishonest way, the big personalities of neo-liberalism, Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, were ahead of the curve on this. Their narrative triumphed for a generation because they convinced enough people that public spending and trade unions were to blame for the economic woes that hit capitalism in the 1970s, and that the private sector, set free to operate in de-regulated global markets, would create wealth and affluence.But, if I was ever frustrated by some of those early discussions, one thing that would always lift my spirits was the irrepressible activity of what were known in Loto as “Jeremy’s outriders”. There were dozens of them on Twitter and Facebook who, day in and day out, were pumping out great material exposing the Tories and putting across many of our arguments. I include in this organised groups such as JeremyCorbyn4PM and Momentum, but mostly they were people acting on their own initiative out of sheer personal commitment. When the election was called a month or so later, they would play a crucial role. The Tories had nothing like it. Since the election, they had produced a “digital toolkit”, but Peter Stefanovic – a lawyer who had given up his day job to spend a year campaigning, and one of the outriders I had most contact with – thought it lacked a crucial ingredient: “The difference is that we believe passionately in what we’re doing, in the manifesto, in the principles behind it and how it’s going to change the country. You can’t manufacture that belief.”Stefanovic is a natural communicator with a knack for finding the right words to make a point or, dare I say it, tell a story. If this was easy, more people would be good at it. But language is a complicated thing. And the Sanders campaign was not so helpful in this respect. Some of their terms could be imported – a “rigged” system was one we used – but George Bernard Shaw was right when he said the US and Britain are two countries disunited by a common language. Corbyn could not say he would “stand up for Main Street against Wall Street” and “fight for the shrinking middle class” without confusing everyone.Among British political terms, I felt the phrase “left behind” presented some problems. In a note to Seumas Milne, the director of strategy and communications, before I started as his deputy in the leader’s office, I said I thought it was isive. Ukip and far-right newspapers such as the Daily Express were using “left behind” to pit predominantly white working-class communities against a so-called liberal metropolitan elite. In using “left behind” we were actually reinforcing the false idea that the only people left behind are in Brexit-leaning areas where traditional industries have been decimated. Who is most “left behind”: a young person in Islwyn who can’t get a job, or a young person in Islington who can’t afford the rent on a bedsitter, never mind buy their own home? Globalisation destroys jobs in some parts of the country and inflates house prices in others. “Left behind” pits its victims against each other. Which, of course, is why Farage and co use it.Milne and I were agreed on this, and he had already started discussing these narrative issues with two consultants, Marc Lopatin and Jem Bendell. In a blog a few months earlier, they had argued that Theresa May had “put her tanks on Labour’s lawn” by kicking off her premiership with “a spot of cross-dressing” in her pitch to ordinary working-class families. To respond, Labour needed to create a “permission space” with voters who weren’t listening to us because the Tories had been successful in blaming us for the deficit. Arguing that tactics and language had to be “fit for purpose,” they had said: “And that purpose is securing votes. So, while Corbyn’s ultimate vision involves stirring a lost spirit of solidarity and community, Labour must embrace voters as they find them and design conversations accordingly. Because the prize is bigger than reconnecting with former Labour heartlands. When Mrs May references working-class families as ‘just getting by,’ she also knows that millions of families higher up the income ladder identify themselves in the very same terms.“So, when Labour speaks, it needs to explain how government has been failing families across the board and how this can be fixed ... If Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership can lift its gaze beyond the food bank, the government will have a fight on its hands.”I did not see austerity as only being about food banks – or its other extreme manifestations, such as homelessness – but was that the impression we were giving?Jon Trickett, meanwhile, had prepared a paper for the Loto strategy group that overlapped with these discussions. Trickett is one of Corbyn’s closest allies and brings to the table not only the insights of an MP from a northern seat – Hemsworth in West Yorkshire – but also a searching political mind that looks beyond what’s going on in the trenches. Trickett’s paper emphasised the need for Labour to create “a majoritarian coalition” around a “transformational” offer rather than use “retail” politics to appeal to different interest groups. When a general election came, we should make it about the kind of country we wanted to build and why it would serve the interests of the great majority of people, not only those experiencing the most acute symptoms of Tory policies.In time, Lopatin and Bendell would propose replacing “left behind” with “held back”. “Held back” could be applied to a whole range of ways in which most people’s lives are limited by a society run for the rich. We saw it as majoritarian and unifying – it spoke to both sides of the Brexit ide. More than that, it implies a call to action: whereas “left behind” encourages people to think of themselves as victims, “held back” suggests an obstacle to be removed. It prompts questions: what is holding me back, why and how can I do something about it? There was a story emerging here – and, like the best stories, a contradiction that required resolution. Looking back on it, we were all inching towards an approach that would gel around “for the many, not the few” – a suggestion that did not surface until the first full day of the general election campaign.The pressure on Milne and me to make a decision was intense because leaflets were going to print and artwork was needed for the campaign bus. That afternoon, Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) was due to gather for a scheduled meeting and would expect our presentation to answer this most basic of questions. The strapline we had used for the local elections – “standing up for you” – was designed to position candidates as champions of their communities, but it was not applicable to a campaign aiming to win power at Westminster and deliver fundamental change. The idea of people being “held back” was already built into our narrative, as was juxtaposing “a society rigged for the rich” against “one in which people could lead richer lives”. But the two campaign co-ordinators, Ian Lavery and Andrew Gwynne, were still deeply unhappy about any use of “rich” or “richer”, which had been misinterpreted by some of the participants when tested at focus groups, and almost everything else we toyed with seemed lame and unoriginal.As I pressed on with writing the presentation for the NEC, Milne went to see Gwynne and Lavery to listen to their concerns and discuss other options. The meeting was inconclusive, but Gwynne came back to Loto to continue the brainstorm with Milne by running through past Labour straplines and discussing which ones had worked and which hadn’t. They agreed the 2005 motto “Britain forward, not back” was the worst they could remember, with the 2015 effort “better plan for a better future” not very far behind.As they delved deeper into the past, the words “the many, not the few” from the party’s constitution came up. The phrase was part of a new version of clause IV proposed by Tony Blair and adopted at a special conference in 1995 to replace Labour’s longstanding commitment to “common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange”. The dropping of the old clause IV was opposed by those of us who saw it as a New Labour move to distance the party from the idea of public ownership. However, the new clause contained phrases that are common ground for all its members, among them the words adapted from Shelley’s poem Masque of Anarchy. It was written in 1819 following the Peterloo massacre at St Peter’s Field, Manchester, when cavalry charged into a crowd of tens of thousands who were demanding the right to vote. For Milne, it felt right to use them again in a different context, and Gwynne agreed.By now it was nearly midday, and my NEC presentation still had a big hole in it. When I scurried into Milne’s room, he said: “What do you think of ‘for the many, not the few’?” It was one of those FFS moments when you realise there’s a good reason why some things stand the test of time – in this case, nearly 200 years. With the word “for” added, the phrase encapsulated the idea of building a society that serves the great majority and not accepting one that is run by and for a privileged elite. It went beyond modifying the way the country is run by making it “fairer” or “better” and implied a transformation to a wholly different way of doing things.Of course, the fact that Blair had used the words complicated this interpretation. Would some people consider it sullied? How could the same slogan apply to a “centrist” platform – whose proponents were “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich” – as well as our much more radical one? We hardly had any time to debate these doubts, but would the vast majority of voters know or care about them anyway? My instinct was that most people would not be aware of how “the many, not the few” had been used before and those who did would realise Corbyn – of all people – truly meant the message it embodied.• Extracted from Game Changer: Eight Weeks that Transformed British Politics, published by Accent Press on 18 April (£15.99).

All he’d ever wanted in life was to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony but one thing had led to another and he’d been devastated to wake up one morning to find he was one of the richest people on the planet and that various evil people were doing beastly things on his beloved Facebook.He was trying to stamp it out, he added, attempting the expression his operators had assured him could be interpreted as sincere, though it was a challenge.The first few questions came from committee chair, Greg Walden. Was Facebook a media company? Oh no! It was just a total coincidence it had livestreamed 25 Major League Baseball games. Was Facebook a financial institution? Oh no! It was just a total coincidence people could send each other money through it. Had he ever thought to monetise people’s data? “We don’t sell people’s data,” Zuckerberg said, sounding hurt. There was no need when he could flog so many advertisements instead.Just when it looked as if we might be getting somewhere, Walden called himself to heel. Every questioner was just going to get four minutes each and it was too bad if they had to bail out half way through a promising line of inquiry. The Zuck began to relax and the first hint of a smile crossed his face. This was going to be a doddle after all. Just ramble on in vague generalities to wind the clock down. And if things felt like they were getting a bit tricky either say, “I respectfully disagree” or “that’s too complex to answer here, let me get back to you”.It also turned out that some Republican representatives weren’t even that interested in asking him anything about the data scraping scandal involving Cambridge Analytica that had prompted the hearing in the first place.Joe Barton merely wanted to know why a couple of Conservative bloggers had been shut down on Facebook, while Fred Upton reckoned that more regulation might make life too tricky for start-ups to compete with Facebook. As if they stood a chance.A third Republican used his four minutes to share pictures of his dad while another almost sobbed as he described the amount of money he had raised for charity through Facebook. It was all the Zuck could do to prevent himself from running across the chamber to give these guys a hug. He’d never expected to be asked such intelligent and perceptive questions.The Democrats were a little more forensic but they too were stymied by the four-minute rule. Anna Eshoo tried to narrow things down by asking some yes or no questions, but rather blew it by wasting half her allotted time in a pointless preamble. And even when it looked momentarily as if Zuck was close to being put on the spot all he had to do was drag out his answers. Yes but no but yes but no but yes but no but what was the question again?Just occasionally a few nuggets did come out. We learned that the Zuck’s own data had been mined by Cambridge Analytica, though we didn’t discover what ads pop up for socially awkward, secretive billionaires. We learned that Facebook was thinking about suing Alexander Analytica. Most bizarrely of all, we learned that the Zuck thought there was a huge team of Cambridge University academics hell-bent on undermining Facebook. Needless to say we ran out of time before he was able to expand on that.But mostly we learned exactly what Zuckerberg wanted us to learn. Which was not very much. Just that he was this misunderstood dude who was more sinned against than sinning. This dude who was devastated to find that some people had taken advantage of him but hadn’t quite got round to doing anything about it. This dude who just happened to be CEO of one of the most profitable companies in the world and was giving his best impression of someone who didn’t have a clue how it was run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94a822e593b6b96aa9be8f79cf8a0ebf60628f3f/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0db320f4516d9d52ed5c771f8302b373 1240w","title":"labour announces plan for under 25s to have free bus travel","story":"Councils opting for publicly owned bus services to get funds partly arising from road taxUnder 25s would have free bus travel under a Labour government, the party said, proposing a scheme that would be paid for by ring-fenced cash arising from road tax.The party said local authorities who moved to introduce public ownership of bus services or franchising would be given the funds to provide free travel. The scheme would incentivise councils to create municipally owned bus companies.The party said its research could help up to 13 million young people save £1,000 a year, based on the average price of a bus ticket in England. The policy would cost £1.4bn a year by the end of a five-year parliament, with franchising or municipalisation of services likely to be staggered. Labour said the funds would use about a fifth of the income from vehicle excise duty revenues, forecast to be £6.7bn in 2021, which is currently allocated to road building. The party said it would widen the hypothecation and use the pledge of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, for a £250bn National Transformation Fund to pay for road building, to be paid for by government borrowing.Jeremy Corbyn will launch the policy at a visit to a sixth form in Derby on Thursday, and is expected to say: “Young people deserve a break. Nearly eight years of Tory austerity have hit their incomes, their chance to buy a house and their career opportunities. On average, children, young people and households with children each have less disposable income than working-age households without children. Young people also tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel. Giving them free bus travel will make a huge difference to their lives.”The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said the funding would provide an incentive for councils to bring services back into public ownership companies often chose to operate only the most profitable routes, leaving councils to fund the less popular rural routes that were still a key lifeline for communities.“Buses are vital for easing road congestion and air pollution, but for too long private bus companies have run our services for profit not people,” he said.But the transport minister, Nusrat Ghani, said Labour had “no real ability to deliver” the promise of free travel, suggesting it could cost up to £13bn, which Labour has denied. Ghani said Labour were “bribing young people again with yet another empty promise”, after first promising to abolish tuition fees. “Our balanced approach to the economy means that we are able to help people with the cost of travel by extending railcards to everyone under the age of 30, while councils also have the power to offer cheaper travel for young people.”The Conservatives also criticised the pledge to fund road building from the National Transformation Fund, saying it would mean funding a day-to-day spending commitment with borrowed money.A Labour source said it was nonsense that the policy would cost £13bn, a sum it said was based on the assumption that every person under 25 in the UK would use a bus 10 times a week. Labour’s costs were based on a lower price with services taken in-house and modelled on the free bus passes for elderly people.

From flattened ears to affectionate bum-flashing, a cat behaviouralist reveals what it all meansAs the first cat was domesticated more than 4,000 years ago, you’d think we’d have them figured out by now. But no. We still expect them to fit in with our modern lives with zero compatibility issues, despite the fact that cats are fundamentally solitary hunters so naturally they behave differently – it’s in their DNA. To hone your animal instincts, animal behaviourist, cat expert and author Anneleen Bru decodes cat behaviour for beginners.What they do: rub around your legsWhat it means: ‘I feel good’“Often a cat will do this if you are preparing their food,” says Bru. “It means: ‘I like this person, I feel safe, I’m happy.’”Cats use pheromones in a very clever way – think of it as leaving scented Post-It notes around their core living space. Rubbing against certain furniture is reinforcing a message that it’s their happy place.What they do: flash their bumWhat it means: ‘I like you’When a cat flashes its derriere to another cat they are being really welcoming.“It’s their way of saying to another cat: ‘Hello, I like you,’” explains Bru. “So, when they do that to us, their humans, it means the same thing.”What they do: purrWhat usually means: ‘I’m happy and chilled’What it sometimes means: ‘I’m stressed and in pain’“Mostly, purring is pure contentment, but sometimes it can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or illness. Cats don’t show pain, but they exhibit subtle changes in their behaviour instead. In these instances, purring offers relief to an anxious or stressed cat, in effect they are trying to self-soothe.”Tip: If your cat has always purred and stops, see a vet as it could indicate a health issue. Equally, if it doesn’t normally purr, but starts, see your vet. Any sudden behaviour changes could be a sign your cat needs veterinary treatment.What they do: sleep in weird placesWhat it means: ‘I’m keeping myself safe’“As a solitary hunter, cats like to sleep up high so they are safe and aware of their surroundings,” says Bru. “Sleeping up high, or in hidden places, like cardboard boxes or in cupboards or drawers, is in their DNA. It’s how they survive. Let them do it.”What they do: padWhat it means: ‘I’m chilling and really enjoying myself’“This is real self-soothing behaviour that goes back to kittenhood,” says Bru. “It’s the action that kittens do to release the milk at their mother’s teats, often this action can send them into a real trance and cats will do this until their final years. It’s the epitome of a happy cat.”What they do: close their eyes, while sitting close to youWhat it means: ‘I love you’“This is the equivalent of a cat’s kiss,” says Bru. “If you open your eyes wide and close them while looking at your cat, it’s telling them you love them back. It’s cat whispering. Try it.”What they do: flatten their whiskersWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’Whiskers are super-sensitive radar devices for cats as they struggle to focus on anything an arm’s length from their face. Their long, coarse whiskers have highly sensitive nerve endings at the roots – they can determine if prey is close by and what space is around them.What they do: stare at other catsWhat it means: ‘I hate them’“This is the feline equivalent of giving the other the middle finger,” says Bru. “Don’t ever think that two cats staring at each other is going to lead to anything gentle. It won’t.”What they do: drop their tailWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’“A straight up tail, or one held in a question-mark shape, is the sign of a happy cat,” says Bru. “This is the complete opposite.”What they do: flatten their earsWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’ (sensing a pattern?)The most obvious sign you have an unhappy cat. Combine it with an arched back, bushy coat, flattened ears, erect bushy tail, deep moaning and you have a very, very grumpy cat.What they do: pee in your trainersWhat it means: ‘You need to sort out my litter tray situation’“In the wild, cats will pee and poo in different places,” explains Bru. “A cat is programmed to bury its poo to hide from predators, its pee is less of an issue so it will do that elsewhere. Also, cats prefer to use a litter tray that is high up and hidden so they feel less vulnerable. Look at your litter tray setup and change it accordingly.”What they do: spray urine on vertical areasWhat it means: ‘I’m worried about something in this place’“If not neutered, your cat, male or female, will spray as a sexual marking,” says Bru, “If neutered, this is a stress sign – look at what may have changed in the environment, such as the threat of other (unfamiliar) cats who may be able to enter or stare into the house.”What they do: yawnWhat is means: ‘I’m chilled’Usually a yawn is a relaxed signal of your cat releasing stress and relaxing. This is another chance for you to communicate with them. Yawn back and see what happens.What they do: gently bite you during petting What it means: ‘This is gooood’A gentle nibble means serious appreciation a harder one may suggest your cat is a little over-stimulated, so perhaps give them some space.What they do: bring you dead animalsWhat it means: ‘You’re a terrible hunter’Bringing home a kill is often more common in females than males, some research suggests by bringing home the kill, the cat has adopted you as part of its family and its DNA says it has to feed you and teach you how to hunt. However, it’s also just what they do, cats are hardwired to hunt – some more so than others. Bringing home a kill actually has nothing to do with you, says Bru. “Cats will stalk and kill prey, even when they don’t have the intention of eating it. They will bring it to their core area, because this is where they feel safe.”You don’t need to be a mind reader or body language expert to know what your cat needs to eat – at every stage of life, they require food tailored to them.

She reflects on the hard-won highs that come with sharing a home – and a heart – with a felineIf cats are capricious, the humans who love them are worse. To be a cat lover is to embrace confusion, rejection, austerity, frustration and chaos. To share your home with a cat is to seek comfort, beauty, affection and joy, but accept that such delights will be tightly rationed, allocated seemingly at random, and frequently withheld altogether. Cat lovers are philosophers, poets and perverts, and I wouldn’t be anything else.Contrary as they are, cat lovers mistrust the undiscerning affection and allegiance of dogs. Naturally it’s possible to appreciate all animals, and I genuinely love dogs, but when a labrador bounds up to me like I’m some sort of human holy grail, I’m reminded of the words of Groucho Marx: “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.”My cat, Elvis, by contrast, makes me feel like I have something to prove. Elvis keeps me on my toes he holds me accountable for my actions. My cat makes me want to be a better human. And, like all pack animals, I respond well to being kept in check by my tiny furry overlord.It’s been six months since Elvis came into my life, as an eight-month-old black longhair rescue. Speaking to the shelter, I explained that I didn’t care about colour, age or gender, but specifically requested a “dog-cat”. Dog-cats share some of the genial qualities more regularly attributed to a dog, by being social, confident and affectionate. Throughout my childhood, my mother excelled at selecting dog-cats: non-skittish, friendly little moggies who could handle the aggressive adulation and clumsy affection of three small children. Gingie, Coke and Parsley were all dog-cats. Now I’m an adult, I made certain that the first cat I chose was a dog-cat.Elvis waits by the window when I return home from work in the evening. He thoughtfully inspects every new visitor to my flat, as if they are a second-hand Volvo he’s considering purchasing. He’s every inch the alpha, striding confidently into the room, announcing his presence with a succession of meows.Green-eyed, long-haired and graceful, at times Elvis resembles a moving sculpture, and he is quite the prettiest object in my home. He’s also a breathing, purring hot water bottle, and his weight, warmth and rhythmic breathing make my shoulders slacken and my pulse slow at the end of a frantic day. He frequently makes me laugh out loud, play-fighting with my left foot, lolling voluptuously on the sofa, or playing football with purloined biros across the wooden floorboards. Sometimes he glares at me with barely disguised contempt and disapproval, when I come home late, smelling of another animal. It’s nice to know that he cares enough to be cross.But Elvis allows me my independence. I’m permitted my frequent work trips, providing that I supply a temporary giant slave woman during my absence. When I come back, I stretch out on the sofa and he falls asleep on my chest, and then I know that the cat-sitter has not replaced me in his affections. One of the joys of owning a cat is building these little rituals together. Rituals that nobody else understands but Elvis and I.Adopting a rescue cat like Elvis makes the owner-cat journey even more of an emotional melodrama. I watched him grow from being a slightly cagey kitten to a confident, strutting alpha cat. Today he acts like he doesn’t need me, but I take comfort in the knowledge that it was my love, attention and steady supply of edibles that turned him into the independent young man that he is. I don’t know anything about his background we prefer not to dwell on the past, Elvis and I, and just look to our happy future together.If you’re embarking on your own cat-owner journey, get off to happy, healthy and – here’s hoping – affectionate start with our advice on everything from prepping your home to the early days of kitten development and training, and make sure you start by feeding them correctly.

When the next Games are held in Birmingham in 2022 there are 13 sports guaranteed a place, with beach volleyball among another 13 sports fighting for the four remaining spots.While Birmingham may not have such a stunning backdrop as the Gold Coast, London 2012 proved volleyball can draw the crowds on home shores, proving one of the hits of the Olympics when it was played on Horse Guards Parade. Gregory and Sheaf know an English medal could prompt Birmingham 2022 organisers, who decide which sports to include, to look kindly on beach volleyball.“I’m obviously biased,” Gregory said, “but the atmosphere, venue, crowd and everything they do around beach volleyball is incredible and it would only be an asset to a Commonwealth Games at home, so I hope we can keep it in. A medal for us would go a long way to convincing them. It was our goal coming here to give ourselves a chance to win a medal and we have done that. Of course it’s not gold but it’s always good to look at the positives.”Their semi-final was the Ashes on sand as the third seeds faced Australia, with the home nation ranked No 1. England won the first point but it was the only time they were ahead. Gregory, who at 6ft 9in is the tallest member of Team England, made several excellent blocks but Australia won the first set 21-13. Dancers dressed as lifeguards provided the entertainment between sets as Feeling Hot Hot Hot by the Merrymen blared around the arena but it did little to inspire an comeback. England called a time-out at 18-12 down in the second set and it briefly revived them as they got back to 18-15 but Australia’s class showed.“We wanted to do better,” Gregory said. “It’s been really tough just getting here. We’ve had a lot of ups and downs on and off the court but we knew we were going to face them.”To say they have faced obstacles on the route to the Gold Coast would be an understatement. Gregory was identified as part of the Sporting Giants programme, a nationwide talent search that began in 2007 with the London Olympics in mind. It counts the world champion rowers Helen Glover and Vicky Thornley among its alumni. Gregory did not make it to a home games but the scheme encouraged him to address an irregular heartbeat.“I kept having these episodes,” he has said. “During matches or training I’d get this fast heartbeat. I was aware but left it for a while but they kept getting worse. Eventually, they diagnosed it as supraventricular tachycardia.”He had heart surgery at Kings College hospital in London. “It was four hours on the operating table,” he said. “I was awake the whole time. There was a risk I’d need a pacemaker and that would have meant no sport at all but thankfully it went well.”While many athletes in Team England have a comfortable existence on UK Sport funding, Gregory and Sheaf have had to use industry and imagination, funding themselves for most of the last four-year cycle.Their rise up the world rankings, from outside the top 300 to 65th in the world by last March was enough to secure £40,000 of Sport England funding, which allowed them to compete internationally for the last year. For most of the year the duo, both 28, practise inside what is little more than a shed in the grounds of a school in Bournemouth, enduring freezing cold in the winter, a huge contrast to the Gold Coast heat.“This is an incredible arena,” Gregory said after the semi-final, “by far the best we’ve ever played in. We’re disappointed not to be in the final but it’s always good to reflect on what you’ve achieved and it’s not over yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd70fc19a590708ed97f90530fd2307effdc394a/0_270_6862_4116/master/6862.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6ec206d21d851d6029eb8ab17bca9828 1240w","title":"grand national meeting foxhunters test soft ground","story":"• Foxhunters’ Chase will give clues for Grand National day• Nicky Henderson likely to retain title as champion trainerThe Grand National meeting at Aintree will open on Thursday with four consecutive Grade One races and several of the sport’s best chasers and hurdlers in action, but it is the fifth event on the card – a hunter chase – that may be studied most closely by the punters ahead of the biggest betting race of the year on Saturday.The word ‘heavy’ no longer appears in the going description for the Grand National course after a dry night on Tuesday and the track was “quietly drying out” on Wednesday according to Andrew Tulloch, Aintree’s clerk of the course. How quietly should become apparent when 22 runners are due to go to post for the Foxhunters’ Chase a few hours after the final declarations are made for the National itself.A slow-motion finish will be taken as final confirmation that the National on Saturday will be the most demanding test since the famous fences were modified with plastic cores before the 2013 renewal.“It’s still a bit soggy down at the Canal Turn,” Tulloch said on Wednesday. “That’s always the wettest bit on the course. It should be mainly dry on Thursday, just overcast and cloudy all the way through with some drizzle in the morning.Thursday’s field for the Foxhunters’ is well short of the race’s safety limit of 30, which should take a little of the edge off the race’s potential for drama and mayhem. But it still seems sure to be a fierce examination both for the horses and their amateur riders, and one in which the huge experience of Derek O’Connor could prove vital aboard Balnaslow (4.05).O’Connor is an amateur jockey in name only, as his winning ride on Edwulf in this season’s Irish Gold Cup demonstrated. He has completed the course on all three of his previous starts in this race, finishing runner‑up twice including a one‑and‑three‑quarter length defeat on his mount 12 months ago, and has an obvious chance to finally add the “amateurs’ National” on his record.The only disappointment after the Cheltenham Gold Cup last month was that the extended duel between Native River and Might Bite had to have a loser. The two horses staged a magnificent spectacle as they fought out a private battle from the off, and with Native River in summer quarters Might Bite (2.50) should have a straightforward path to victory in the opening day’s feature chase, the Grade One Betway Bowl.Nicky Henderson, Might Bite’s trainer, is all but certain to retain his title as champion trainer, a feat he last achieved 31 years ago, and he has several more runners with clear chances in the day’s remaining Grade One events.His perennial rival Paul Nicholls has several live runners on the card too, however, and both Cyrname (1.45), in the Manifesto Novice Chase and Malaya (2.20) in the Anniversary Juvenile Hurdle have realistic opportunities to give their trainer his first Grade One success of 2018.The gamble on Katie Walsh’s mount Baie Des Iles for the Grand National continued on Wednesday, and the grey is now top-priced at 16-1 (from 20-1) having been available at 66-1 last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b5b65808b7f59c9571b48391ddd005d6bbbb6f7/0_0_2000_3000/master/2000.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e477d948ac19e9164bb97e51b498aa3b 480w","title":"chicago review cuba gooding jr phoenix theatre london","story":"Phoenix theatre, LondonKander and Ebb’s show about crime and celebrity is faithfully recreated but is beginning to resemble an animated corpseIf this Kander and Ebb musical feels as if it has been with us for ever, that is because it has. It premiered in 1975, directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, and was given a more minimalist revival by Walter Bobbie that bowed on Broadway in 1996 and came to London a year later. It is that version, now starring several Chicago veterans as well as Cuba Gooding Jr, that has been faithfully recreated and, while it is done with great professional skill, it is beginning to resemble an animated corpse. That image is appropriate since the show is all about death: speaking of Chicago in the 1920s, it argues that “in this town murder is a form of entertainment”. Using the form of a Brechtian vaudeville, Kander and Ebb follow the story of Roxie Hart, a small-time hoofer who shoots her lover and exploits her mythical pregnancy to escape the rap. Fame, however, is fleeting and Roxie soon finds that she is yesterday’s news. Her solution is to go into partnership with another headline-seeking killer, Velma Kelly, and form a touring sister act. The show is harsh, cynical and funny and chimes well with an age that understands the psychotic nature of celebrity. I’m all for reviving old musicals, but this one has not been imaginatively rethought. Tania Nardini and Gary Chryst are credited, respectively, with recreating the 1996 direction and dance. But even in 1996’s revival, the choreography by Ann Reinking was “in the style of Bob Fosse”. His trademarks are still visible: the men sport tilted bowlers, there is much jutting of the bum and thrusting of the pelvis, and chairs are dragged backwards across the stage. He was a highly inventive choreographer but here the dance begins to feel not so much Fosse-ised as ossified. Even if the production is a carbon copy, performers bring iniduality. Sarah Soetaert invests Roxie with the elfin mischief of a naughty schoolgirl who, eyeing up the rippling muscles of the male chorus, coos: “These are my boys.” Josefina Gabrielle, another Chicago regular, plays Velma as the more hard-bitten of the two and does some impressive spins, twirls and high-kicks. As the self-seeking lawyer, Billy Flynn, Gooding Jr displays too much surface charm and sings modestly but hoofs energetically. Meanwhile, Ruthie Henshall, who played Roxie in London in 1997, now zestfully executes the role of the jail den-mother and Paul Rider inevitably scoops up the sympathy as Roxie’s discarded husband in a number, Mr Cellophane, celebrating his invisibility. The lead actors all do their stuff, the ensemble is lively and the onstage band, under the direction of Ian Townsend, is exceptional: the evening’s best moment comes when the brass are given the spotlight at the start of the second act. But, while it is pleasant to renew acquaintance with numbers such as All That Jazz and Razzle Dazzle, everything is exactly as I remember it from 1997: that includes the chilling moment when a rope descends from the flies as a Hungarian girl dies protesting her innocence to remind us of the reality of judicial murder. For all the cast’s commitment, this is as much a piece of museum theatre as those old Soviet shows that went unchanged through the decades."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78a9f1cc7745d68f11031f340b67471f9ba8a28/0_274_4153_2492/master/4153.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=28e7ad4a18b1610309892d8dc5b1ae98 1240w","title":"shakespeares globe casts its own artistic director as hamlet","story":"Michelle Terry in lead male role, as theatre pursues her pledge for democratic, gender-blind castingThe first experiment in democratic casting by Shakespeare’s Globe has led to its artistic director, Michelle Terry, taking the role of Hamlet and, in As You Like It, a role normally played by an elderly man.Terry announced her first season as artistic director at the London open-air playhouse in January with the eye-catching promise of giving more power to the casts and other creative people involved in the plays. A company of 12 actors helped decide who played who in the two productions once the rehearsals had started. Gender swapping in the theatre is not the novelty it perhaps once was but a woman playing Hamlet, the most coveted of any of Shakespeare’s roles for young or youngish actors, is still an infrequent event. Given Terry’s stage pedigree, including a barnstorming performance as Henry V in Regent’s Park, London, in 2016, it is no surprise the company chose her to play Hamlet. High-profile recent Hamlets have included Benedict Cumberbatch, Andrew Scott, Paapa Essiedu, Tom Hiddleston and Maxine Peake.In the play As You Like It, Terry will play Adam, the elderly (“almost fourscore”) faithful family servant.The Globe’s gender-blind approach to casting means Jack Laskey, known for his role as DS Peter Jakes in ITV’s series Endeavour, can play the heroine Rosalind in As You Like It, a role which has been played by Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith and, in 1991, a young Adrian Lester. Bettrys Jones will play the lovesick Orlando, and, in Hamlet, she will be Laertes.A spokesperson for the Globe said: “The directors and Michelle assembled 12 excellent actors and cast from that group. At the start of the process we were keen not just to cast to type, but ensure that any actor could play any character. “Each of the ensemble were aware that they would get one larger role in one play and one or a series of smaller roles in the other. We’re thrilled to be putting these two plays, written in the same year, in the playhouse for which they were written.”Hamlet and As You Like It are the opening shows in Terry’s inaugural summer season. Some eyebrows were raised when she was appointed because she was an actor who had never directed but she said that too much pressure was placed on a director to “solve” the plays. “It is unfair that everything gets dumped on the director’s shoulders, and actually it is a really collaborative process, especially for our theatre, which is one of the most democratic and egalitarian spaces that we’ve got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500a9932e9b82e6f31762e1fc1a0322450f74ec6/0_300_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e13cab383edc3ca5372fab96f835f367 1240w","title":"fact checking mark zuckerberg testimony congress","story":"When it came to data collection, the CEO cleverly deflected lawmakers’ scrutiny. Here are the claims that don’t stand upFacebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg remained calm and composed as he sat through more than 10 hours of questioning by members of congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. His strategy appeared to be to show remorse and deference, highlight the changes Facebook had already made and pledge to do more to protect user privacy and prevent foreign interference in elections.However, when it came to the nuts and bolts of Facebook’s business model, the 33-year-old deflected scrutiny through a combination of declared ignorance, amnesia, and word-class public relations spin.Here are five responses that don’t stand up to scrutiny.Several members of congress asked Zuckerberg about the data Facebook collects about people who aren’t already members of Facebook. These are known as “shadow profiles” and explain why, if you were to sign up for the first time to Facebook right now, it would already know who all your friends are – thanks to Facebook slurping your friends’ full address book from their phones, photos and other data sources. Firstly, Zuckerberg said he was “not familiar” with the term “shadow profiles”. Given the widespread media coverage of the phenomenon, led by Violet Blue at ZDNet and Gizmodo’s Kashmir Hill, this seems difficult to believe.Zuckerberg was pushed further on shadow profiles by congressman Ben Luján, who asked whether people who don’t have Facebook accounts can opt out of Facebook’s involuntary data collection.“You’ve said everyone controls their data, but you’re collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users, who never signed a consent or privacy agreement and you’re collecting their data,” Luján said.This seems like a big problem for Facebook because getting consent to collect data about an inidual is part of data protection 101. That’s before we’ve considered whether the consent people give when the sign up to Facebook could be considered “informed”, since it’s unlikely many people read the 2,700-word data policy.When asked by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham to name Facebook’s biggest competitor, Zuckerberg struggled and dodged the question by saying: “The average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch.”What Zuckerberg didn’t mention is that Facebook, with 2.2 billion users, is by far the biggest and that many of the other most popular apps – WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – are also owned by Facebook. Snapchat, Skype, Houseparty and others are picking up the scraps. “You don’t think you have a monopoly?” asked Graham. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” replied Zuckerberg, to a ripple of laughter.Plenty of academics disagree with that assessment, arguing that Facebook’s dominance and network effect means it skews the marketplace by sucking investment capital and profits away from smaller businesses. Just take a look at how Facebook went after Snapchat.Zuckerberg gave a vague response when asked by Senator Roger Wicker whether Facebook can track users after they had logged off from the platform. At first he said he’d get his team to follow up for accuracy’s sake.“I know that people use cookies on the internet and that you can probably coordinate activity between sessions. We do that for a number of reasons, including security and including measuring ads to make sure that the ad experiences are the most effective, which of course people can opt out of.”The Australian internet security blogger Nik Cubrilovic first discovered that Facebook was apparently tracking users’ web browsing after they logged off in 2011. Responding to Cubrilovic, the Facebook engineer Gregg Stefancik confirmed that Facebook has cookies that persist after log-out as a safety measure (to prevent others from trying to access the account).However, in 2014 Facebook started using web browsing data for delivering targeted “interest-based” advertising – which explains why you see ads for products you have already been looking at online appear in your Facebook feed.When asked whether Facebook’s tools on external websites collected transaction data, Mark said: “I don’t think any of those buttons collect transaction data.”Details on Facebook’s own site about its “pixel” tool appear to directly contradict that statement. Advertisers who want to track which of their Facebook ads make people buy their products can install a small piece of computer code (the pixel) onto their websites and this will tell which Facebook users visit which page of their website, which ones put items in their shopping basket and which ones make a purchase."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37de9b683e104cf2334f25e9368a01c378638096/0_0_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c61167b8eed7b6e5255c6aa082da61e 1240w","title":"huawei matebook x pro laptop review slim macbook pro rival","story":"Beautiful screen, excellent keyboard, great trackpad – Huawei’s new machine shows it has what it takes to build a great laptopThe MateBook X Pro is Huawei’s more powerful follow up to last year’s excellent MateBook X, and as the name might imply it is aimed squarely at Apple’s MacBook Pro.PC laptops have come a long way in the last few years, with good design, build and performance – all hallmarks of Apple’s laptop line – now common in the £1,000-plus category.It would be fair to say that the MateBook X Pro has more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s top-end laptop. It’s not that it’s a carbon copy, more a machine that takes just the good bits.With the lid closed it looks like a fairly generic thin-and-light aluminium laptop with a gentle taper and a Huawei logo on the top, available in “space grey” and silver. Open it and you find a MacBook-like backlit keyboard, large trackpad, a power button and two side grilles.But the screen is the star of the show. It’s a beautiful and crisp 13.9in 3:2-ratio screen squeezed into the frame with very slim bezels all round. It’s easily one of the best on the market and is quite large by modern laptop standards, housed in a smaller body typically associated with a 12in-screen laptop.The build of the machine is generally very good, with chamfered edges and a good fit and finish. There’s no give or flex in the keyboard, but there is a little in the rest of the deck and at the sides. The screen also has a little bit of give when squeezed when closed, or twisted when open.The MateBook X Pro is available in a couple of configurations, with a choice of 8th generation Core i5 and i7 processors, 8 or 16GB of RAM and 256 or 512GB of storage.Most of that is par for the course, but the Huawei machine also comes with a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 2GB of dedicated memory, which is rare for a machine of this size.The MX150 won’t set the gaming world alight, but it is a significant step up in performance for things like editing photos and video, or even powering a 4K display over your typical integrated graphics chips. It’s worth noting that the MX150 comes in two versions and the MateBook X Pro is fitted with the lower power 10W version, which is less powerful but more frugal than the 25W version that some other machines have fitted.Overall the MateBook X Pro was one of the best performing laptops I’ve ever used, easily handling anything and everything from video editing and advanced photo editing, to a bit of light gaming and Chrome with as many tabs as you can fit on one screen.The MateBook X Pro might be thin, but it still has a single full-sized USB 3.0 port along side a USB-C port and a Thunderbolt 3 port. Either of the USB-C-shaped ports can be used to charge the machine, while there’s a traditional headphones socket, but no card reader.Huawei is well known for its battery life in smartphones. Unfortunately, while the MateBook X Pro has reasonable battery life it isn’t anywhere near class-leading. It will get you through a work day without needing the charger, but if you want to watch a video on the commute home you’ll be out of luck.In my testing the MateBook X Pro lasted just over eight hours between charges while performing regular office duties, which includes lots of email, around 15 browser tabs open in Chrome, some photo editing, listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and lots of writing into lightweight text editors. Heavier things such as gaming affected the battery life quite a bit, but generally speaking most users will plug the laptop in to game or perform similarly demanding tasks for any extended period.Performance aside, the MateBook X Pro is a lovely machine to use. It’s whisper-quiet for the most part, with its fans only spinning under sustained heavy load, and its brilliant screen is matched by an equally excellent keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard looks like a MacBook Pro keyboard, but with real key travel. It’s a satisfying typing experience that is rarer than you might think on even expensive laptops.The keyboard also hides one of the most interesting tricks I’ve seen on a laptop in a while. The key between F6 and F7 is actually a pop-up webcam. Press it and it reveals a one-megapixel camera, which certainly has a tendency for the up-the-nose shot, but simply doesn’t get in the way during normal use. If you’re one of the vast majority of laptop users that barely ever turn on their webcam, this is a great compromise and it means no one is going to be able to hack your webcam and spy on you. There’s even a mute switch for the microphones, so no one will be able to listen to you either.The large trackpad is silky smooth and responsive, making it one of the best in the industry – at no stage did I end up zooming when I tried to scroll, which is something many PC laptops still struggle with.The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner and will recognise you and log you into Windows when switching on with one momentary press, taking about eight seconds to power on and be useable. The MateBook X Pro has a Dolby Atmos sound system with four speakers built into it: two tweeters at the back and two bass speakers at the front, not that there’s any visual indication that they’re there.I was sceptical, but the four-speaker system actually works very well. It’s louder, clearer and has a smidgeon more bass than most of the best of the rest, although the audio is less direct than it might be on a machine with front-facing speakers such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro.They’re still laptop speakers, so don’t expect true room-filling sound or the quality of a set of external speakers, but they’re capable of being clearly heard while cooking and provide solid impromptu movie-watching experience.The Huawei MateBook X Pro will cost €1,499 with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, €1,699 for the same processor and RAM but 512GB of storage, or €1,899 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage – as tested.A UK launch and pricing has yet to be determined.For comparison, For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a comparable screen and 8th generation Core i5 starts at £1,399, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, the Surface Book 2 starts at £1,499 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249.Models with discrete graphics cost more, with Microsoft’s Surface Book 2 starting at £1,999 and Apple’s 15in MacBook Pro starting at £2,349.The MateBook X Pro shows that Huawei has what it takes to build a great laptop.The screen is brilliant and the tiny bezels mean you get a very good sized display in a pretty small body – 14in, it turns out, is a great size for both work and play on a thin and light laptop. It’s not a one-trick pony, either. It has one of the best keyboards on the market, an excellent, large trackpad and solid connectivity, it is a do-it-all machine in a beautiful case.It’s not perfect, though. There’s give in the aluminium where I don’t think there should be, and the battery life is good but not class-leading. But on the whole Huawei has created something quite special here.Pros: beautiful screen, tiny bezels, slim, compact, excellent keyboard, great trackpad, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, regular USB port, fingerprint scanner, discrete GPU, pop-up webcam, Dolby Atmos speakers that are goodCons: battery life not class-leading, no SD card slot, webcam has an up-nose angle, only two USB-C ports of which one has to charge the machine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b12b47a4b90fd840ea3ef5e131e745b853d00d4/0_490_4754_2853/master/4754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=87e66f528cc95e2106ed4f50a6b3a176 1240w","title":"passwords webauthn new web standard designed replace login method","story":"WebAuthn will eliminate need for passwords by moving to methods of authentication such as biometrics, says web standards controllerA new web standard is expected to kill passwords, meaning users will no longer have to remember difficult logins for each and every website or service they use.The Web Authentication (WebAuthn) standard is designed to replace the password with biometrics and devices that users already own, such as a security key, a smartphone, a fingerprint scanner or webcam. Instead of having to remember an increasingly long string of characters, users can authenticate their login with their body or something they have in their possession, communicating directly with the website via Bluetooth, USB or NFC.“WebAuthn will change the way that people access the Web,” said Jeff Jaffe, chief executive of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body that controls web standards.One example of how WebAuthn will work is that when a user visits a site they want to log into, they input a user name and then get an alert on their smartphone. Tapping on the alert on their phone then logs them into the website without the need for a password.WebAuthn promises to protect users against phishing attacks and the use of stolen credentials as there will be nothing to steal, the authentication token is generated and used once by their specific device each time the user logs in.“After years of increasingly severe data breaches and password credential theft, now is the time for service providers to end their dependency on vulnerable passwords and one-time-passcodes and adopt phishing-resistant FIDO Authentication for all websites and applications,” said Brett McDowell, executive director of the FIDO Alliance, one of the bodies pushing the new standard.WebAuthn should also help people use unique login details for each and every service they use, instead of using the same login and password for every site, which many people still do leaving them vulnerable to further attacks if one site is hacked.The W3C has moved WebAuthn to what’s called the “candidate recommendation” stage – the penultimate step before it becomes an approved web standard – inviting sites and services to begin implementing it. The web standards body announced that Google, Microsoft and Mozilla had committed to supporting WebAuthn, meaning that all major web browsers short of Apple’s Safari will implement the new standard.“While there are many web security problems and we can’t fix them all, relying on passwords is one of the weakest links. With WebAuthn’s multi-factor solutions we are eliminating this weak link,” said Jaffe.Several sites and services already use similar methods to log in, including Google and Facebook, which can both be logged into using a USB security key. But a single cross-platform, cross-service standard ratified by the W3C will mean that many more sites and services will be able to kill the password as the defacto login method.WebAuthn is the culmination of many years of work and the change will not happen overnight. But as it increasingly seems inevitable that our email or other online services will get hacked into, removing the password is an important step in improving online security and making using sites and services easier."},{"url":null,"title":"zuckerberg hearing facebook tracking questions house back foot","story":"In his second day on Capitol Hill, Zuckerberg says his own data was handed to Cambridge AnalyticaThe Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, was given a rougher ride on his second day of congressional testimony on Wednesday as he faced sharp questions about the tech giant’s ability to track its users’ movements, shopping habits and browsing histories and was at one stage compared to J Edgar Hoover.During five hours of testimony, the billionaire entrepreneur revealed that his own personal information was among that handed over to the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their permission. The Democratic congresswoman Anna Eshoo, reading questions from her constituents at a hearing of the House energy and commerce committee, asked Zuckerberg whether his data was “included in the data sold to the malicious third parties”. After a brief hesitation, the Facebook CEO replied: “Yes.” Eshoo called Facebook’s terms and conditions around privacy a “minefield” and asked Zuckerberg one of many blunt questions put to him on Wednesday: “Are you willing to change your business model to protect users’ privacy?”Zuckerberg, 33, gave one of many evasive responses: “Congresswoman, I’m not sure what that means.”On Tuesday, Facebook began notifying millions of people around the world that their private information may have been given to Cambridge Analytica in the worst privacy debacle in his company’s history. Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper.The data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by the Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan. The Democratic congressman Eliot Engel of New York asked if Facebook planned to sue Kogan, Cambridge University or Cambridge Analytica.Zuckerberg said legal action was being considered and added: “What we found now is that there’s a whole programme associated with Cambridge University where … there were a number of other researchers building similar apps. We do need to understand whether there is something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require a stronger action from us.”Zuckerberg was presumably referring to Cambridge University’s psychometrics centre, which media reports have suggested worked with Cambridge Analytica on ways to predict human behaviour, although the university denies this.Zuckerberg was widely considered to have emerged more or less unscathed from his near five-hour appearance before a joint Senate committee on Tuesday in what had been billed as a moment of reckoning for Silicon Valley. He was rarely thrown off his talking points by middle-aged senators who frequently displayed their lack of tech expertise.But on Wednesday members of the House were more punchy and willing to interrupt his flow as they asked questions on privacy, surveillance, censorship and politics, regularly asking for yes or no answers which he struggled to provide. Republican Marsha Blackburn said: “I can’t let you filibuster right now.” John Sarbanes, a Democrat from Maryland, said: “Facebook is becoming a self-regulated superstructure for political discourse. Are we, the American people, going to regulate the political dialogue or are you, Mark Zuckerberg?”The Democrat Frank Pallone asked Zuckerberg to make a clear commitment to change all Facebook’s default settings to minimise the possible collection of personal data. The Facebook founder declined to give a simple response, saying: “Congressman, this is a complex issue that I think deserves more than a one-word answer.” Pallone replied: “That’s disappointing to me.”Mike Doyle, a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, raised the Cambridge Analytica matter and asked: “When the Guardian made the report, was that the first time you heard about it?” He accused Facebook of “turning a blind eye” to developers’ abuses, adding: “There is a real trust gap here. This developer data issue is just one example. Why should we trust you to follow through on these promises?”Zuckerberg answered: “Respectfully, I disagree with that characterisation. We’ve had a review process for apps for years. We’ve reviewed tens of thousands of apps a year.”The Florida Democrat Kathy Castor told the CEO: “A devil’s bargain has been struck. Americans do not like to be manipulated. They do not like to be spied on. Facebook now has evolved to a place where you are tracking everyone. You are collecting data on just about everybody … I don’t think the average American really understands that. You’re following Facebook users even after they log off that platform.”Zuckerberg tried to reply, “Broadly, I disagree with your characterisation,” but was frequently cut off by Castor. She demanded: “You are collecting personal data on people who are not Facebook users. Yes or no?”Zuckerberg failed to give a yes or no response and was again interrupted. Castor said: “You watch where we go. Isn’t that correct?”He said: “Everyone has control over how that works.” But again Castor interjected: “Are you saying you don’t gather data on where people travel?”She added: “It’s practically impossible these days to remain untracked in America. And that’s not part of the bargain.”Several other members of the House committee pressed Zuckerberg on whether Facebook was transparent about much information it collects on users and even non-users. Some tech analysts following proceedings from afar picked holes in his testimony, accusing him of conflating different points on the issue of whether users own and control their data.The technologist and reporter Ashkan Soltani tweeted: “Zuck’s answer to Rep McNerney’s question re: ‘Facebook’s collection of browsing history’ was disingenuous. Facebook *does* track browsing behavior via social widgets. However are not stored as inidual websites but instead as ‘interest categories’.”The Republican David McKinley presented screenshots of opioids available to buy on Facebook without a prescription. “Your platform is still being used to circumvent the law,” he said: “Facebook is enabling an illegal activity and in so doing you are hurting people … You said before you were going to take down those ads, but you didn’t do it.”Zuckerberg repeated his belief that artificial intelligence was needed to help police activity on Facebook.The Democrat Jan Schakowsky of Illinois also gave Zuckerberg an uncomfortable moment by reading aloud various apologies he had issued in the past for mistakes. “You have a long list of apologies,” she said. “This is proof to me that self-regulation simply does not work.”Indeed, questions of greater regulation of the tech industry have run through the two days of hearings. Zuckerberg acknowledged: “The internet is growing in importance around the world in people’s lives and I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation. So my position is not that there should be no regulation but I also think that you have to be careful about regulation you put in place.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

It takes a lot of time, but that’s fine, because that’s what history’s good at. “How the devil did they get away with that,” you might think, looking at a magazine cover’s lineup of the architects of the Good Friday agreement that is entirely male, and doesn’t include Mo Mowlam. “What happened to the women who actually broke this story,” you possibly wonder, surveying an all-male panel called upon to discuss the finer details of the Cambridge Analytica revelations. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not the next day, but some time soon the airbrush will have come for Theresa May, Angela Merkel and Sheryl Sandberg, and we will be confused, unable to understand how Brexit meant Brexit, or the euro survived, or who taught Mark Zuckerberg how to open his mouth in the manner of a person smiling.In fact, all social movements of any importance were started by middle-aged women, and there’s a solid case-by-case reason why we have forgotten them all. The Fight the Famine Committee, after the first world war, began in the house of Catherine Courtney in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, but that’s right on the corner of the road where Margaret Thatcher was coached in public speaking to get rid of her high, grating (cough “female”) voice and make her sound like a story tape on a Sony Walkman that was running out of batteries (this reference is aimed purely at middle-aged women). So already I can’t remember who destroyed the industrial heartlands, and who started the organisation that became Save the Children, which was run by two sisters, though unfortunately they are lost to the mists of time, because one of them had a funny name (Eglantyne Jebb) and the other one didn’t (Dorothy Buxton).The temperance movement was driven by women, but we let ourselves be written out of that because it gave us a bad name. The highly fruitful school of thought connecting poverty to infant mortality, and perhaps more radically still, holding infant mortality to be a bad thing, was developed by the anarcho-socialists Maud Pember Reeves and Charlotte Wilson in the early 20th century (in fact, Pember Reeves was the socialist and Wilson the anarchist but these things sound more authentically middle-aged when you mash them together). The background to their work was the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which found poverty to be morally driven, exacerbated by do-gooders giving food and relief to poor people, which only incentivised them to be more poor. Pember Reeves and Wilson discovered, with close and what we would now call “embedded” research into the respectable poor, that the children of highly moral ones were also dying in large numbers before they reached the age of 10. You can see why this would be easier to erase than to commemorate.The abolitionists Hannah More and Elisabeth Jesser Reid were forgotten because they were basically doing the same thing as William Wilberforce, and he had that pretty alliteration going on with his name. Mary Prince, a campaigner, author and former slave, got a commemorative plaque in Camden in 2007, so that’s OK. Sarah Parker Remond, another woman of colour working internationally against slavery in the 1850s, had a more famous brother, which is a near-failsafe way to get yourself written out of history.Shall I use my cloak of invisibility to fight crime, or for evil? That’s the question I ask, upon turning 44. Fortunately, it won’t be remembered either way, and the world is our plaything.The internet causes a lot of cognitive dysfunction. We all know that because we read it on the internet, but sometimes the details get lost because you see the word “dysfunction” and think: “No, this could not possibly mean me.”The “epistemic bubble” is when you no longer read anything that you don’t already agree with. Nobody enters any bubble on purpose, it is just the natural consequence of getting all your news from sources – friends, relatives, colleagues – whose views chime with your own. It’s a dicey premise – that any of us agree with our colleagues, let alone our relatives – but just take it on trust.The “echo chamber” is where you sometimes hear information you don’t like, but you disbelieve it on that basis. This happens to me all the time, but I am often right and the information turns out to be untrue. No algorithm has yet been found to deal with the fact that just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean people aren’t out to get you.Astroturfing, where a couple of troll-bots dress themselves up as a wider political movement, and sockpuppet accounts, where you create a social media profile to say the things the real you can’t, is something I’m not prepared to adopt until alternative, serviceable words are found for actual AstroTurf and actual sockpuppets.One under-reported category is the bastard-filter, where every story you hear about your opponents leads you to believe they are complete and irredeemable bastards. I am thinking about the story alleging that Conservative canvassers were flung out of a pub in west London this week for having a meeting about how to “spin Grenfell”, but that was one of 10 bastard-filter stories that day. The Conservatives categorically deny it, but the inertia and misanthropy have set in. One day, when I work out how, I’m going to invent a bastard blocker. Only my friends, relatives and colleagues will ever see it, but that’s OK, because we will agree that we’re happier.This is a full but not exhaustive list of Karl Marxes, as they exist in the common consciousnethere’s the Conservatives’ Marx, who personally escorted Russians in their millions to gulags, while laughing the economists’ Marx, who invented the law of the tendential fall in the rate of profit, which may or may not be correct and the historico-literary Marx, shifting our gaze mildly away from inidual agency, towards underlying structural causes. And now, Karen Pierce, UK ambassador to the UN’s Marx, who would be turning in his grave to see the actions of Vladimir Putin, because obviously, the Russian Federation is the same as the USSR, and a kleptocratic autocracy was definitely what Marx had in mind when he wrote Das Kapital.

The Mayor is currently in the West Bank city of Ramallah after border control officials at Ben-Gurion airport failed to prevent his entry last night due to the misspelling of his name on the warrant issued preventing him from entering the country. The Sinn Féin councillor travelled to Ramallah on the invitation of the Palestinian Authority, to attend a conference held on the status of the city of Jerusalem. A source in the population and immigration authority said the Dublin mayor entered Israel due to a technological glitch.“The details aren’t received with the man’s picture,” the source explained. “The ministry of strategic affairs misspelled the man’s name in the document it gave the border control, and that’s how it was entered into the system. If someone is barred from entering, the system should produce a warning as soon as the name is entered, but when someone arrives with a passport bearing a different name, there’s no way of knowing about the ban.”On Wednesday, Israeli ministries were blaming each other for the bureaucratic bungling that allowed the Mayor to pass through the airport undetected. The interior ministry claims it was provided with the wrong name, but the strategic affairs ministry insists Mr MacDonncha’s name was spelled correctly. “The probe is necessary in order to prevent such mishaps in the future and to glean lessons from what happened,” he said. “After the Lord Mayor of Dublin departs from the country, and in light of his activity against Israel, I’ve instructed that a letter be delivered to him which would forbid future entry into Israeli territory.” Mr Deri decided to bar the Mayor, who was invited to a conference in Ramallah as a guest of the Palestinian Authority, due to his active promotion of a boycott against Israel.In a statement to the media, Mr Deri said the Mayor led the Dublin City Council decision on April 9th calling on the Government to expel Israel’s ambassador to Ireland. Last August, Israel introduced a new policy to bar boycott activists from entering Israel. Officials in the strategic affairs ministry recommended Mr MacDonncha be denied entry into Israel due to his “consistent and clear activity to advance boycotts against Israel”, and his activity in one of the most radical boycott groups, the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Strategic affairs minister Gilad Erdan said “the policy I set is clear: He who works consistently to boycott Israel will not enter here”. Israel’s foreign ministry also issued a statement condemning the Dublin council decision calling for the Government to expel the Israeli ambassador.“The city of Dublin adopted a shameful and ridiculous resolution, in the hateful spirit of Hamas and similar organisations,” the statement said. “It is utterly unacceptable that the capital city of a country which is a member of the European Union adopts resolution that is entirely a boycott, hateful and racist. We expect a scathing Irish condemnation of this despicable resolution.”  Speaking on Wednesday morning on Newstalk Breakfast, Mr MacDonncha said he brought a message of support from Dublin for the need for inclusivity, a negotiated settlement and dialogue.Rejecting criticism that he should be focusing on the housing crisis in Dublin rather than travelling to Palestine, Mr MacDonncha said the visit was for only three days and that Ardmhéara had traditionally made occasional international visits.Mr MacDonncha said he had accepted the invitation because Dublin City Council supports the people of Palestine and was critical of Israel.Recent events in Gaza with the shooting of protesters by Israeli soldiers were reminiscent of Bloody Sunday in Derry, but on a larger scale, he said.The move by the Israeli government to declare Jerusalem the capital of the State of Israel was a backward step in the peace process, he added.Last year the United States also recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in a move that sparked protests among Palestinians. “It’s very difficult to see hope of a peace deal,” Mr Mac Donncha said.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458644.1523474956!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fbi raid on cohen office a search for access hollywood tape say sources","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Trump has taken a more adversarial tone toward Robert Mueller since the warrant was executed Monday. File photograph: ReutersThe FBI agents who raided the office and hotel of President Donald Trump’s lawyer Monday were seeking all records related to the “Access Hollywood” tape in which Mr Trump was heard making vulgar comments about women, according to three people who have been briefed on the contents of a federal search warrant.The search warrant also sought evidence of whether the lawyer, Michael Cohen, tried to suppress damaging information about Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The disclosure comes a day after it was revealed that authorities also sought documents from Mr Cohen related to payments made to two women who claim they had affairs with Mr Trump, Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford, as well as information on the role of the publisher of the National Enquirer in silencing the women.The new details from the warrant reveal that prosecutors are keenly interested in Mr Cohen’s unofficial role in the Trump campaign. And they help explain why Mr Trump was furious about the raid. People close to the president and Mr Cohen regard the warrant as an attempt by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, to pry into Mr Trump’s personal life – using other prosecutors as his proxy.Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Mr Cohen, referred to his earlier description of the raid as “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” He has described it as an overreach by prosecutors into the privileged communications between Mr Cohen and his client, Mr Trump.Mr Cohen has acknowledged paying $130,000 to Ms Clifford, a pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who said she had a sexual encounter with Mr Trump. She signed a nondisclosure agreement, promising not to discuss the matter. Agents also sought documents related to deals with other women.Federal prosecutors are investigating Mr Cohen for possible bank fraud, but they are also scrutinising whether these efforts amounted to improper campaign donations to Mr Trump. President Trump, who had been planning to make a decision this week about whether to sit down with the special counsel for an interview, has taken a more adversarial tone toward Mr Mueller since the warrant was executed Monday. Although he had said for months that he wanted to be questioned by Mr Mueller, his stance has changed since Monday, and the prospect of him willingly being questioned is far less likely, according to two people briefed on the matter. – New York TimesRead more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves around the worldThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/30/TELEMMGLPICT000159114527_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british cheese now status symbol us japan","story":"British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroadBritish cheese exports are booming in a boost for the UK economy, thanks to a growing demand for smelly cheeseboards in US and Japan.British cheese makers are rapidly expanding to cope with the demand as traditional cheeses like Stilton and Red Leicester are increasingly being recognized as a status symbol abroad, experts have said. Cheese producers now send around a third of their product abroad, with January 2018 seeing a 23 per cent increase in UK cheese exports compared with January of 2017, data from Dairy UK shows.English Blue Stilton cheese for sale at Broadway Market, HackneyFor example a £25m pound expansion is underway at a historic dairy in Leicestershire to meet a surge in demand for cheese from overseas.

Operating profit increased by 80.6 per cent from £1.02bn to £1.84bn, while profit before tax was up 795 per cent at £1.3bn, from £145m. Group sales rose 2.3 per cent from £49.9bn to £51bn, as the supermarket added 260,000 more customers.  Tesco and Morrisons fastest growing big supermarkets, data showsThe company said it would pay a idend of 3p per share, the first idend it has announced since embarking on a strict cost-cutting strategy in the wake of an accounting scandal almost four years ago.  Shares in the group rose as much as 3.9 per cent in early trading, after the results were published on Wednesday. In September 2014, Tesco admitted to a £250m overstatement of profits for the first half of that year. The UK supermarket watchdog later found that the group had been deliberately and repeatedly withholding money owed to suppliers to boost its sales performance artificially.On Wednesday, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, who was parachuted into the top spot after the scandal in a bid to turn things around, said the business was making good progress.“We are generating significant levels of cash and net debt is down by almost £6bn over the last three years,” he said. “All of this puts us firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions, and create long-term value for every stakeholder in Tesco.”The company said it is set to meet its target, outlined in October 2016, of reducing costs by £1.5bn and improving operating margins to between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent, by the 201920 financial year. Tesco also said the integration of wholesaler Booker, which it bought last year, is “well underway” and is expected to generate a “synergy benefit” of £60m within the first year.Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets, said investors were pleased with the supermarket’s expectation-beating performance, and added: “The competition is still fierce as discounter outlets such as Aldi and Lidl are holding the strong position in the market, and this remains the nightmare for Tesco. However, the new CEO who took the helm back in 2014 has simplified the product line, and he is determined to cut the cost.”Meanwhile, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tesco was enjoying a “renaissance”.  “Its turnaround plan is literally paying idends to shareholders,” he said. “The outlook is now looking more positive for the grocery sector after a pretty challenging year in 2017. The inflationary squeeze looks to be easing on consumer purses, as is the exchange rate pressure on the cost of stocking shelves.” Mr Khalaf added: “Competition in the grocery market is still fierce, with the discounters Aldi and Lidl piling on the pressure, alongside the likes of Morrison and Sainsbury. “Tesco has responded strategically to the tough trading environment by purchasing the wholesaler Booker, overcoming competition concerns and some shareholder grumbling to do so.  “Overall Dave Lewis will be pleased his strategy is starting to gain traction, with sales and margins heading in the right direction, and the Booker acquisition in the bag.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It said the money should be refunded to customers.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The allegations centre around online strategies for the manipulation of voters deployed in the US 2016 Presidential election and the UK’s European Union referendum. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has given evidence to parliament. Meanwhile, across the pond, Mark Zuckerberg will reportedly testify in front of the US Congress. The backlash has been brutal with the #DeleteFacebook movement taking off. Markets have responded accordingly with Facebook’s share value plummeting.Writing in The Observer last year, Carole Cadwalladr posited that Britain (and one may as well add the US) are increasingly looking like “a ‘managed’ democracy. Paid for by a US billionaire. Using military-style technology. Delivered by Facebook. And enabled by us.”However, the real story is much bigger than the fallout from the Trump election and the Brexit vote. It is a story that extends beyond a limited set of players in Silicon Valley and the billionaire super class. It encompasses governments, the military and intelligence agencies intent on exploiting the internet and social media for surveillance, control and manipulation of citizens and societies. Facebook removes hundreds of pages controlled by Russian organisationThe concept of managed democracy stretches back a hundred years. After the introduction of universal suffrage, the establishment was concerned about the outcome of elections. During the 1920s Edward Bernays was one of the pivotal figures who helped to develop the concept of managed democracy. Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud and the father of modern-day public relations. He understood that advertising could subliminally tap into the unconscious of repressed animal instincts, such as sexual desire. Bernays’ clients included some of the largest US corporations. Bernays transplanted the same techniques into politics as outlined in Adam Curtis’s 2002 BBC documentary The Century of the Self. This could be achieved through propaganda in various guises, such as the use of mass media in order to manipulate populations. The US military and CIA deployed psychological operations (mass propaganda induced through emotions) across the world in various theatres ranging from the wars in Korea and Vietnam to Central America during the Cold War. The only difference today is that the internet has become the new playground for 21st century psychological operations. How Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlHow Silicon Valley and the super rich took controlDonald Trump, Mike Pence and technology company chiefs at a meeting at Trump Tower in New York, 2016Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly agreed to testify before the US Congress following pressure from politiciansThe 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease around technologyGoogle’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in IraqChristopher Wylie, one of the founders of Cambridge Analytica and now a whistleblower who exposed how the data firm harvested data from millions of Facebook usersAccording to The Observer, billionaire Robert Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10 million stake in the company Cambridge Analytica.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, prior to the US 2016 election, online automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Whisteblower Edward Snowden\u0027s files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook.Silicon Valley – from heroes to villainsFor a long time, Silicon Valley presented itself as the shiny, happy face of capitalism. It sold the promise of new technology that could connect the global village. Facebook’s mission statement was, “Making the world more open and connected”. The internet even held out the utopian possibility of liberating societies. Networks amplified political activism and bypassed the monopoly of the corporate media. The internet provided a cloak of anonymity for whistleblowers fighting state andor corporate power. Wikileaks and Julian Assange would even attempt to take credit for catalysing the Arab Spring through the Cablegate leaks revealing the corruption and vulgar excesses of tinpot dictators. Yet as with all technology, it has proved to be a double-edged sword. Disturbing revelations have exposed a darker side of exploitative, highly secretive and even sinister practices. Public sentiment has turned from infatuation to outrage. The 2017 movie The Circle, based on the Dave Eggers novel and starring Tom Hanks and Emma Watson, tapped into the present mood of unease.The marriage of big data and neoliberalism enabled the metrics of the market to be extended to every sphere in society. A Black Mirror episode “Nosee” imagined the dystopian vision in which this process is taken to its logical conclusion. Every emotional experience, lived moment and interaction is exploited, mined, recorded and measured with constant recalibration interfacing with one’s personal score and therefore social status. Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is one of those credited with creating the profession of public relations (Getty)From here it is a short step to Foucault’s concept of the panopticon in which each person is scrutinising and scrutinised by everyone else. The mass collection and retention of data became linked in with surveillance – big brother meets big data. Simultaneously, big tech managed to carve out a libertarian philosophy while being integrated with the national security state. In fact, Silicon Valley has increasingly become part of the military-industrial complex selling its technologies to US military, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Google, for example, has a contract with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) allowing the agency to use Google Earth Builder. Google’s mapping technology is used for geospatial intelligence purposes, such as supporting US troops in Iraq, while Google and the NGA purchased GeoEye-1, which is the world’s highest-resolution satellite. Lacie, the protagonist in the ‘Black Mirror’ episode ‘Nosee’, rating her social interactions on her phone (Getty)In fact, Google has a revolving door with the national security state employing managers with backgrounds in military and intelligence work and it partners with defence contractors including Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman focusing on drones and robotics. Similarly, Amazon has developed a $600m (£426m) cloud computing system for the CIA that also services all 17 US intelligence agencies. Data-mining tech company Palantir was co-founded by Trump donor and backer Peter Thiel. Palantir’s advisers include Condoleezza Rice and former CIA director George Tenet. Its customers include the NSA, FBI and CIA due to the fact that it is a leader in the field of mining massive data sets. It has been deployed by the Marines in Afghanistan and in the Mexican drug war. Its commercial clients include Bank of America, JPMorgan, News Corp and pharmaceutical firms. Peter Thiel is a Silicon Valley tech billionaire, who also co-founded PayPal as a system of electronic payment. He went on to give Mark Zuckerberg the first outside investment in Facebook consisting of a half-million-dollar loan later converted into a 7 per cent ownership stake and a seat on the board. Thiel’s hedge fund Clarium Capital Management had assets of more than $7bn before the financial crisis. His venture-capital firm Founders Fund has an online manifesto that begins, “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters” – summing up his pessimistic stance on the demise of technological utopianism.Thiel has cultivated a libertarian persona outlined in a 2009 essay titled The Education of a Libertarian. This fleshes out the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy since the 1920s. He argues that capitalism is “not popular with the crowd”. Thiel disparages the “unthinking demos”, which has made greater demands for social democratic concessions thus constraining capitalism. Thiel is apparently obsessed with economic stagnation diagnosing that, “without a new technology revolution, globalisation’s discontents would lead to increased conflict and, perhaps, a worldwide conflagration”. He is contemptuous of the failure of imagination of disconnected elites with the danger being that people will turn against capitalism. This is supported by a 2016 Harvard study, which found that a majority of American millennials reject capitalism with a third supporting socialism. It is also in keeping with the demographic shifts driving the Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn phenomena, in turn fuelled by intergenerational injustice. Is Trump right to say Amazon is costing the US Post Office billions?Trump’s biggest campaign donor was Robert Mercer – a reclusive American hedge-fund billionaire and computer scientist. Mercer began his career at IBM working on breakthroughs in language processing integral to the development of artificial intelligence (AI). He went on to become joint CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, which applies algorithms to model and trade on financial markets. One of its funds – Medallion – is reportedly the most successful in the world. All of which has enabled Mercer to coordinate with the Koch brothers donating tens of millions of dollars to Republican political campaigns and ultra-conservative organisations. As The New Yorker investigative journalist Jane Mayer relates, both Mercer and oil tycoon William Lee Hanley had commissioned polling from Patrick Caddell ahead of the 2016 election, which showed “mounting anger towards wealthy elites, who many Americans believed had corrupted the government so that it served only their interests. There was a hunger for a populist presidential candidate who would run against the major political parties and the ruling class.” The data “showed that someone could just walk into this election and sweep it,” Caddell told me. When Mercer saw the numbers, he asked for the polling to be repeated. Caddell got the same results. “It was stunning,” he said. “The country was on the verge of an uprising against its leaders. I just fell over!”.Caddell and partners later went public with the Candidate Smith project based on the idea that the public wanted an outsider Mr. Smith Goes to Washington figure as president. Worryingly, the data also revealed that the public was yearning for a strong man to fix the country. Thiel (pictured with Donald Trump in 2016) is contemptuous of disconnected elites who he believes are turning people against capitalismAccording to The Observer, Mercer applied a big data strategy to the political scene with a $10m stake in the company Cambridge Analytica. It managed to build a 230-million-strong US voter database collecting up to 5,000 pieces of demographic, psychological, consumer and lifestyle information about each inidual with Facebook proving vital to this data profiling. The company is focused on the manipulation of psychographics – the study of personality traits – although its officials claim that this was not deployed in the 2016 US election. The power of the computer algorithms in question is such that 150 Facebook likes can be modelled to predict a person’s behaviour better than a family member. Three-hundred likes effectively means that the algorithm knows you better than a spouse. The effectiveness of this manipulation remains disputed although the power to micro-target iniduals and to induce mass effects at a population level points to sinister implications. Some authorities, such as Emma Briant (author of Propaganda and Counter-Terrorism: Strategies for Global Change), have stated that Cambridge Analytica has the technological capability to effect behavioural and psychological change.Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix told a conference in New York his company was able to predict the personality of every adult in the US (Getty)Cambridge Analytica’s parent company is British corporation SCL Group – formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories. SCL Group works on psychological operations and foreign propaganda campaigns. It collects large amounts of data about an audience in order to identify “persuadables” and target them with tailored messages.  Alexander Nix, the suspended CEO of Cambridge Analytica, declared at a 2016 conference in New York that, “by having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America”. SCL has worked in more than 60 countries including Afghanistan, Libya, Ukraine and Pakistan. It “offers military clients techniques in ‘soft power’”, specialises in “election management strategies” and “messaging and information operations”. It has worked for Nato, the UK Ministry of Defence and the US State Department amongst others in “changing the behaviour of large groups”. In 2012, Facebook conducted studies involving secretive psychological testing of approximately 700,000 of its users. This was through reducing exposure to positive or negative emotional content in order to measure the effects. The study concluded: “Emotions expressed by friends, via online social networks, influence our own moods, constituting, to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence for massive-scale emotional contagion via social networks.” This study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, while another Facebook project looked at how users consumed information on Twitter.According to Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute’s computational propaganda unit, one-third of all traffic on Twitter prior to the EU referendum was generated by automated “bots”, which were all pro-Leave and prior to the US 2016 election, the same automated bots were 5-1 in favour of Trump with many of them Russian. Similarly, there were hundreds of automated websites pumping out pro-Trump messages crafting a mass consensus or political climate. Reportedly, there are thousands of dormant “sleeper” bots presumably waiting to be activated during a future crisis. The war on terror has enabled the state to amass authoritarian control over iniduals. The Washington Post’s 2010 Top Secret America investigation painted a terrifying vision of the US morphing into an Orwellian big brother state.Militarisation of homeland security is now extensive. General Atomics’ Predator drones monitor the Mexican and Canadian borders through real-time, full-motion video cameras. The Department of Homeland Security collects pictures, videos and other data on American citizens. It even helped Memphis police set up a crime-analysis fusion centre fitted with walls of streaming surveillance video capable of matching army command controls, while Maryland Police have infiltrated and labelled political activist groups dedicated to human rights, anti-war and bike lanes as terrorists.This conflation of the war on terror with political activism means that the definition of terrorism is widened to include any enemy of the state andor corporate interests. Edward Snowden and Julian Assange can thus be viewed as political prisoners or exiles. The US Department of Defence has been funding research into the use of the internet for 21st century psychological operations. The Pentagon’s military research arm – the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) – has been conducting experiments on the internet in order to study social connections, propagation of messages and influence behaviour. In fact, Darpa invented the precursor of the internet – Arpanet, Darpa’s social media in strategic communication (SMISC) programme is developing algorithms for the “formation, development and spread of ideas and concepts (memes)” on social media. SMISC is channelling millions in funding for projects to corporations and academic hubs. This has included studies analysing how Occupy activists used Twitter, Twitter users’ opinions on fracking and interactions of Twitter users in the Middle East. Recent revelations suggest that Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users (Getty)The journalist Glenn Greenwald has revealed that both the NSA (National Security Agency) and its UK sister GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) have been working on exploiting social media. According to the Snowden files, this entails “propaganda”, “deception”, “mass messaging” and “pushing stories”. While GCHQ described its intentions to seed “state propaganda” across the internet. GCHQ’s Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is focused on “using online techniques to make something happen in the real or cyber world” including “information ops (influence or disruption)”.US defence corporation General Dynamics is also involved in information operations. This includes contracts with the Special Operations Command’s psychological operations unit to design websites in order to persuade foreigners to align views with US interests.In-Q-Tel – the CIA’s venture capital firm – has been investing in companies engaged in social media mining and surveillance. Dataminr streams data from Twitter to spot trends for law enforcement agencies and hedge funds. Geofeedia collects social media messages in order to track activists for police departments and corporations. Pathar is used by the FBI to mine social media in order to determine networks and signs of radicalisation. Netbase is capable of scanning billions of sources online and Recorded Future monitors the worldwide web to predict future events. Bruce Lund wrote in a 2012 paper that “monitoring social media” is increasingly essential for government tracking of “erupting political movements, crises, epidemics, and disasters, not to mention general global trends”. Such strategies can be exploited for counterterrorism but are also being turned against citizens by law enforcement and against activist groups by the private sector. Palantir was thus exposed in negotiations to track trade union activists and other critics of the US Chamber of Commerce. Various police departments and corporations such as McDonald’s have contracted with Geofeedia, which markets its research into student demonstrations, Greenpeace and other political movements. In 2008, an Obama adviser, Harvard law professor Cass Sunstein, wrote a controversial paper advocating the use of covert agents in order to cognitively infiltrate online groups, sites and activists. The Snowden files confirmed that intelligence agencies monitor sites including YouTube and Facebook, attempt to “control, infiltrate, manipulate and warp online discourse” and remarkably even carry out “false flag operations” in order to discredit targets.In a wide-ranging New Yorker profile, Peter Thiel told author George Packer that the failures of the establishment have rekindled his optimism pointing the way either towards libertarianism or, conversely, Marxism, although he was forced to concede that unfettered capitalism is not acceptable to ordinary Americans.Peter has cultivated a libertarian persona – a 2009 essay fleshes out what he regard as the increasing incompatibility of capitalism and democracy (Alamy)His thinking essentially represents the extreme manifestation of a growing consensus amongst elites that the status quo is unsustainable. This could lead potentially to instability, systemic collapse and civilizational crisis. In turn, this could pave the way either towards progressive, radical post-capitalist transformation that would necessarily damage vested interests – or conversely an authoritarian order designed to cement those interests. In fact, the status quo is liable to exacerbate inequality, poverty, climate change and social isions ensuring that authoritarian measures are necessary in the face of increasing rioting, disruption and social unrest. Indeed, economist and writer Joseph Stiglitz, who was previously chief economist at the World Bank, has piquantly asked how long it will be before the scenes witnessed during the Arab Spring will be replicated on the streets of America. As Thiel has put it: “The future will be much better or much worse, but the question of the future remains very open indeed. We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of iniduals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort a single person who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism.” It appears that Thiel conceives of himself as this John Galt-type heroic figure lifted straight out of the pages of Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged. The battleground of politics has expanded to include the virtual world of the internet. This is in keeping with media theorist Marshall McLuhan’s prediction that World War Three would be a guerrilla information war with no distinction between military and civilian participation. Youssef El-Gingihy is the author of ‘How to Dismantle the NHS in 10 Easy Steps’, published by Zero booksor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.The everyday examples of flipping a coin or rolling a dice are useful analogies. While both appear to be random, these too could be predicted if enough information were available.Something like a coin flip may seem random, but its outcome could be predicted if one could see the exact path of the coin as it tumbles, said Dr Bierhorst. “Quantum randomness, on the other hand, is real randomness.” Quantum mechanics is better at generating randomness as measurements of quantum particles in a superposition have results that are fundamentally unpredictable.The scientists used photons – or light particles – from a laser to generate their random numbers in a process known as a “Bell test”.If you can solve one of these 6 major math problems, you\u0027ll win $1mThis method uses an intense laser fired at a special crystal that converts light into pairs of entangled photons – a quantum phenomenon. Measuring these photons provided the researchers with their numbers.The scientists trialled their Bell test over 55 million times, each time producing  two digital bits (1s and 0s) with photons.For the first time, Dr Bierhorst and his colleagues were able to close any “loopholes” that would allow seemingly non-random numbers to seem random. The results of this work were published in the journal Nature.“We\u0027re very sure we\u0027re seeing quantum randomness because only a quantum system could produce these statistical correlations between our measurement choices and outcomes,” said Dr Bierhorst.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Operating profit increased by 80.6 per cent from £1.02bn to £1.84bn, while profit before tax was up 795 per cent at £1.3bn, from £145m. Group sales rose 2.3 per cent from £49.9bn to £51bn, as the supermarket added 260,000 more customers.  Tesco and Morrisons fastest growing big supermarkets, data showsThe company said it would pay a idend of 3p per share, the first idend it has announced since embarking on a strict cost-cutting strategy in the wake of an accounting scandal almost four years ago.  Shares in the group rose as much as 3.9 per cent in early trading, after the results were published on Wednesday. In September 2014, Tesco admitted to a £250m overstatement of profits for the first half of that year. The UK supermarket watchdog later found that the group had been deliberately and repeatedly withholding money owed to suppliers to boost its sales performance artificially.On Wednesday, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, who was parachuted into the top spot after the scandal in a bid to turn things around, said the business was making good progress.“We are generating significant levels of cash and net debt is down by almost £6bn over the last three years,” he said. “All of this puts us firmly on track to deliver our medium-term ambitions, and create long-term value for every stakeholder in Tesco.”The company said it is set to meet its target, outlined in October 2016, of reducing costs by £1.5bn and improving operating margins to between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent, by the 201920 financial year. Tesco also said the integration of wholesaler Booker, which it bought last year, is “well underway” and is expected to generate a “synergy benefit” of £60m within the first year.Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets, said investors were pleased with the supermarket’s expectation-beating performance, and added: “The competition is still fierce as discounter outlets such as Aldi and Lidl are holding the strong position in the market, and this remains the nightmare for Tesco. However, the new CEO who took the helm back in 2014 has simplified the product line, and he is determined to cut the cost.”Meanwhile, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Tesco was enjoying a “renaissance”.  “Its turnaround plan is literally paying idends to shareholders,” he said. “The outlook is now looking more positive for the grocery sector after a pretty challenging year in 2017. The inflationary squeeze looks to be easing on consumer purses, as is the exchange rate pressure on the cost of stocking shelves.” Mr Khalaf added: “Competition in the grocery market is still fierce, with the discounters Aldi and Lidl piling on the pressure, alongside the likes of Morrison and Sainsbury. “Tesco has responded strategically to the tough trading environment by purchasing the wholesaler Booker, overcoming competition concerns and some shareholder grumbling to do so.  “Overall Dave Lewis will be pleased his strategy is starting to gain traction, with sales and margins heading in the right direction, and the Booker acquisition in the bag.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An estimated 4.1 million customers will see their bills increase by an average of £60 per year.The price hike was immediately criticised by MPs across the political spectrum. The Government said it was “disappointed” with the “unjustified” decision, while Labour accused ministers of failing to introduce the price cap quickly enough.Centrica, which owns British Gas, blamed the increase on rising wholesale energy prices and said government policies were also responsible.In response, Claire Perry, the minister for energy and clean growth, said: “We are disappointed by British Gas’s announcement of an unjustified price rise in its default tariff when customers are already paying more than they need to.“This is why government is introducing a new price cap by this winter to guarantee that consumers are protected from poor value tariffs and further bring down the £1.4bn a year consumers have been overpaying the Big Six. Switching suppliers will always help consumers get the best deal, saving £308 by switching from a default tariff offered by the Big Six.”The Conservatives included plans for an energy price cap in their election manifesto last year but later passed the issue to energy regulator Ofgem, which was accused of watering down the proposals after suggesting they should be limited to the most expensive tariffs.In her conference speech in October, however, Theresa May announced the government would indeed be introducing an “absolute” cap to “bring an end to rip-off energy prices once and for all”.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

This increase we are announcing today is reflective of the costs we are seeing which are beyond our control.“We continue to work hard to reduce our own costs and keep our prices as low as possible.

Nearly eight years of Tory austerity have hit their incomes, their chance to buy a house and their career opportunities.“Labour wants to help young people make the most out of life by investing in them, which is why today we are pledging the next Labour government will provide the funds to cover free bus travel for under-25s, to support them to travel to work, to study and to visit friends.He will add: “Our policy provides help where it is most needed. On average, children, young people and households with children each have less disposable income than working age households without children.“Young people also tend to be in lower paid, more insecure work, and they spend a higher proportion of their income on travel. Giving them free bus travel will make a huge difference to their lives.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

The party hopes the policy will encourage people to get into the habit of using cars only when necessary.Speaking alongside Mr Corbyn, Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, will say: “Buses are vital for easing road congestion and air pollution, but for too long, private bus companies have run our services for profit not people.How UK rail fares have risen against the cost of living since 1995“The public purse already pays 42 per cent of the costs of providing local bus services, but deregulated private companies choose to run only the profitable services and leave councils to plug the gaps left for non-profitable but vital routes.“That’s why we’ll encourage local authorities to take back control of their buses so they can provide a better and more sustainable service to young and old alike, wherever they live.”The announcement follows a worrying fall in the number of people using buses, which is now at its lowest level in ten years.In London, the reduction has prompted fears among Transport for London (TfL) executives over the state of the organisation’s finances.This, coupled with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan’s decision to freeze some fares, means TfL is facing a deficit of almost £1bn next year.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Eight of the UK\u0027s 10 best-selling albums of 2017 were by homegrown talent, with Drake and Pink being the only outside entries. Sheeran\u0027s third album Divide was the most popular record across all formats last year and broke several industry records.Best albums of 2017Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the annual Brit Awards, said: The changes labels have made to their business models and their investment in new talent have borne fruit with rapid revenue growth in 2017.We are likely to see a continuing rise in 2018, with increasing awareness among consumers about the benefits of music streaming, and new developments that are likely to encourage the uptake of subscriptions, such as the launch of YouTube\u0027s premium music service and the growing popularity of smart speakers in the home.\u0027How did we do all that?\u0027: Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart on EurythmicsFollowing predictions that streaming would overtake physical sales in the UK last year, Taylor said that while the British music sector was in rude health, the government should prioritise creative industries in a post-Brexit world. It means making sure that UK artists can tour freely in EU markets and that UK businesses can access the best talent. It means taking firm action against illegal websites that deny artists a living, and it means making clear in UK law that huge online platforms must pay fair royalties for the music they use.If we do this, the future for British music, which is already one of our leading exports, will be very bright, he said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSeasonal winds washed tons of debris ashore at Matahari Terbit beach, near Sanur, Bali, Indonesia.Syrian onlookers gather around rescue teams clearing the rubble at the site of an explosion of unknown origin which wrecked a multi-storey building the previous night in the war-battered country\u0027s northwestern city of Idlib.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.
