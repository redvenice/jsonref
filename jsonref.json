Around 353,000 jabs were administered on Monday.         "},{"url":null,"title":"Polar vortex bring freezing temperatures state Monday","story":"Share this articleThe U.S. is about to get a potent polar vortex blastOn the sudden stratospheric warming and polar vortex of early 2021 | NOAA Climate.gov"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/02/03/23/37538436-9221007-Locals_have_had_Kuta_Beach_pictured_in_August_devoid_of_all_but_-a-66_1612395618705.jpg","title":"Parler CEO John Matze says hes terminated board","story":"Share this articleMercers vs. Kochs vs. Adelsons: The three ultra-rich families battling for control of the Republican party — Quartz"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0b7961acefed19689086d416a68e5f09ce865c3/339_261_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72c1fc044891d465aa88c25692dc6b03","title":"captain sir tom moore in pictures","story":"Captain Sir Tom Moore, the second world war veteran who raised almost £39m for NHS charities during the first coronavirus lockdown in spring 2020, has died aged 100 after testing positive for coronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32f24fcb97264741fe27e762ad96357d3988c090/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66b4458331ab17aacc46aa11efd6de4","title":"british army film and photographic competition 2020 winners","story":"Regular and reservist soldiers, members of the combined cadet force, army cadet force and university officer training corps, as well as Ministry of Defence civilians who work directly for the army, are allowed to enter the competition"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b55854a5ab29922484a71a285d52502b330fd37/0_420_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3517b466a89fc056c60b3f853d3fc06","title":"indigenous photograph a resource for visual storytelling in pictures","story":"Natives Photograph began in 2018 as a database of indigenous visual storytellers from across north America, providing a resource for those wishing to hire more inclusively – since mainstream narratives historically have been largely in the hands of non-indigenous people.

The group argues that showrooms should reopen that the “earliest opportunity” once it’s safe, with Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, saying: “Following a £20.4 billion loss of revenue last year, the auto industry faces a difficult start to 2021. The necessary lockdown will challenge society, the economy and our industry’s ability to move quickly towards our ambitious environmental goals.Lifting the shutters will secure jobs, stimulate the essential demand that supports our manufacturing, and will enable us to forge ahead on the Road to Zero. Every day that showrooms can safely open will matter, especially with the critical month of March looming.” It’s official, UK car dealers have made their worst start to a new year since 1970.Industry body SMMT reports that just 90,249 new cars were registered last month – the weakest figures for any January in just over 50 years.UK car showrooms were forced to close under the current lockdown, while many commuters are stuck at home, meaning sharply weaker demand.That’s despite dealers using despite click and collect services, and home deliveries, to allow customers to buy cars during the current restrictions on non-essential businesses.Royal Dutch Shell plunged to a loss of almost $20bn last year after the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global oil market stripped around $22bn from the value of its oil and gas assets.The oil company was forced to write down its assets following a slump in oil and gas market prices, leading the company to a loss of $19.9bn compared with a profit of $15.3bn the year before.The historic financial toll caused by the coronavirus also hit BP which reported its first full-year financial loss since the Deepwater Horizon disaster earlier this week, and US oil company ExxonMobil reported its first annual loss ever.Shares in travel firms and hospitality companies are rallying this morning, lifting the FTSE 100 higher.Yesterday, the UK crossed an important milestone in its vaccination programme, with 10 million people now having received their first jab.If the current rate continues, the UK will be on track to give a dose to the 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February, and to complete the remaining five priority groups – another 17 million people – in early April, just after Easter, at the point where the need for second jabs begins. More here.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Britain’s car industry has made a spluttering start to 2021, as the latest Covid-19 lockdown hit the economy.With much of the country under lockdown, and many workers facing a further stretch of home-working, demand for vehicles was its lowest in decades. That’s despite dealers trying to drum up demand through online sales, click-and-collect services and deliveries. Sales were at their lowest level for a January in decades, according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The official figures are due at 9am.2020 was the worst year for UK car sales since the early 1990s, and today’s figures will highlight the ongoing economic damage being caused by the pandemic.The figures come as the UK government faces mounting pressure to plug gaps in its emergency coronavirus wage subsidy schemes at the March budget to support millions of self-employed people and other workers excluded from furlough. MPs and campaign groups said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had repeatedly ducked opportunities to fix gaps in furlough and the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) for almost a year since the Covid-19 pandemic began.Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group Gaps in Support, said it was “completely unacceptable” that more than 3 million people had been completely left out.“While it was understandable at the beginning of the pandemic, when the Treasury had to act fast, that some new support schemes didn’t work as well as they should, it’s a scandal that over 10 months later, so many are still falling through the gaps,” she told the .Later today we’ll hear from the Bank of England, as it sets interest rates and publishes its latest economic analysis and inflation projections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dba564981e5b51f305ea0b60252d8a8aa6a6bd3/0_127_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d49c99b2e5886f9e30157dc64a45c981","title":"labour red wall voters patriotism keir starmer","story":"Voters will reject fake patriotism. Keir Starmer should have the courage to embrace the complexity of our national storyThis week, the  revealed that the Labour leadership is preparing to back a flag-waving strategy to connect with the party’s former “red-wall” voters. The news has generated a disappointment among members and beyond that it’s difficult to overestimate.Not because they don’t care about the country but because they do. Politics is the art of many things. But persuasion and emotional connection to the electorate is ultimately the difference between power and opposition. It’s why “authenticity” in politics is so highly prized.It’s why attempting to distil the complexity of national identity and patriotism into a “brand values” shorthand is not only dangerous but self-defeating. Dangerous, because patriotism has a side that touches on the darkest aspects of our humanity (one need only look at its relationship to the brutality of empire to understand this). Self-defeating, because it simply doesn’t speak to the multi-faceted reality of our lives.My own experience of growing up in Northampton during the 1970s is testament to that complexity. My dad was from the former British colony of Grenada in the Caribbean. My mum was English, born and bred in London. The council estate I grew up on was overwhelmingly white, as was the comprehensive school I went to. One day in the primary school playground, my group of friends were called over by some older boys to join their wrestling team. I tagged along and stood with them ready to face down our opponents. At which point, one of the older boys came up to me and told me I couldn’t be on their team. “Why?” I asked innocently. “Because this is blackies versus whities,” he told me, surprised I didn’t grasp the scale of my faux pas. “You need to go on their side.”When I think back to that story it elicits a mixture of emotions. Sadness, because in so many ways it foreshadowed many of the experiences that I, and thousands of others, were to face growing up in this country and still do to this day. Happiness, because it reminds me of all the friendships I forged and the sense of belonging I found with kids on both sides of those wrestling teams.Mine is one story among millions of others. It isn’t pro-English or anti-English. It’s just a true English story. Because I’m part of England and my experiences, like those of thousands of other black Britons then and now, is part of this island story. It’s a story still in progress. One that cannot be expressed by simply standing in front of a flag or wearing a tie to a remembrance service. It’s a complex and beautiful thing that Labour as a party should have the imagination and courage to embrace. Because it’s just like all of us, contradictory and sometimes messy.So why opt for a faux flag-waving brand that’s a cheapened version of patriotism? Perhaps the glaring lack of any kind of political project, as some expressed in the party’s focus groups, is one reason. There’s little vision and even less analysis of why we are where we are as a country: one gripped by one of the world’s worst Covid death tolls a disintegrating polity and attacks from an increasingly authoritarian government on our democratic institutions. No one expects fully formed policies at this stage of the electoral cycle. But a pencil-sketch of the house you want to build would be a start.Yet rather than addressing this it seems we’ve opted to treat voters like Lego bricks that can be built up to form an electoral alliance. An approach that ignores the fact that “foundation-seat” voters, just like any other voters, are not homogeneous pieces in a game. They have widely differing feelings about our country, its history and their place in it. Of course, there’s a place for brand management in politics but it cannot fill a policy, values and vision void.But perhaps the single biggest reason for the flag-waving is also the most unpalatable for me. That’s my party’s refusal to unpack our country’s relationship with patriotism, identity and racism. Whether Jim Callaghan’s overtly racist Immigration Act, New Labour’s “war on immigrants” or Gordon Brown’s dog-whistle “British jobs for British workers”, it’s a spectre that has haunted our party for decades.Black Lives Matter and the public outrage it generated, when the implications of racism in our society were becoming clearer by the day, was a chance for us to begin to address this issue to unpack difficult conversations surrounding 400 years of slavery, brutal subjugation and exploitation in the name of race superiority to begin to reconcile that past so we can think about a better future. Old wounds, opened up by Brexit, will not be healed by a union jack sticking plaster.I went with the army to Afghanistan in 2009. Despite being on the left, and despite being told in the cadets that “there ain’t no black in the union jack”, I still opted to serve. The army is a complex organism, much like wider society. And yet in many ways, in the crucible of combat, that complexity is distilled down to its basic components. One day, eating my lunch while on patrol, I overheard an officer give one of the biggest bollockings I’ve ever heard. When I asked what had happened, it transpired that a soldier had been overheard by a platoon sergeant calling a Fijian comrade “a fucking black bastard”. The corporal explaining this to me said: “Out here we have each other’s backs. If you can’t trust the person next to you then it degrades the entire effectiveness of the platoon.”If our country is to prosper in an increasingly hostile century, we must face it together – as a unit. But before we can do that we must confront our past – in all its goodness and, yes, all its darkness. And we must acknowledge that our present-day nation is so much more colourful than the red, white and blue cliches. Whether controversial statues, the teaching of our history, or how we relate to one another, the common theme is one of complexity. We can’t shy away from that. Trying to stuff patriotism and identity into a cheapened caricature from the 1950s is not the answer. Our party, our people and our country deserve more than that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10a1871477916e567ef2b0d604d2c9647a30b6d5/0_59_5256_3153/master/5256.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=45a62316431dd6fc16644a99aac15d0e","title":"wall street versus the redditors the gamestop goldrush podcast","story":"When a group of amateur investors on a Reddit messageboard began buying up stock in a video games retailer it forced huge losses on major Wall Street hedge funds that had bet against it. But following a trading frenzy the stock began to fall, almost as quickly as it had risenAt the beginning of the year, not many people were paying attention to GameStop. Its business of selling video games in retail stores looked increasingly shaky as the market shifted ever more online in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. GameStop’s seemingly grim prospects led Wall Street hedge funds to take out big bets on the company’s share price falling further (known as short selling) but they had not reckoned with a force that was about to blow them away. Users of the Reddit messageboard WallStreetBets began grouping together to buy huge quantities of GameStop’s stock, driving the share price higher and higher and inflicting huge losses on the hedge fund titans.  Desmund Delaney tells Rachel Humphreys that as part of the Reddit community he was tipping shares in GameStop back in 2019 and took his own advice investing in the company, despite the derision of other users. But he gave up on the company last year while its share price was below $10 and cashed out. If he’d sold last week he would be sitting on half a million dollars.  Economist Dan Davies explains that while the phenomenon of an online community-driven stock market bubble feels new and exciting, it’s a story as old as the markets themselves. A group of investors egg each other on to speculatively jack up the price of shares they are holding – only for the whole thing to come crashing down. In the case of GameStop, it may have burned some incautious hedge fund managers, but the steep decline in the share price this week has proved to be a sharp lesson for amateur investors who didn’t sell up before the crash began. Are online forums a new force on Wall Street? Or are the odds still stacked too steeply against them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dba564981e5b51f305ea0b60252d8a8aa6a6bd3/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ee71476cc2aa603b1992dd69cdc0aa84","title":"australian open draw delayed covid case","story":"The Australian Open will go ahead as scheduled, starting on Monday at Melbourne Park, despite the detection of a Covid-19 case in a hotel quarantine worker at a facility linked to the tennis.“We’re absolutely confident the Australian Open will go ahead,” Tennis Australia’s chief executive, Craig Tiley, said on Thursday afternoon. “We will be starting on Monday and we have no intention of changing times.”But players eager to know which side of the draw they are on and the identity of their opening opponents will be kept waiting, with the draw for the year’s first grand slam put back from Thursday to Friday.Some 500 players and support staff were forced into isolation after the infected person – a 26-year-old man working at one of the hotels containing some of the sizeable tennis cohort visiting Melbourne – returned a positive test result on Wednesday.Testing began in earnest on Thursday morning and those affected will remain in isolation until they return a negative test. As a result, Thursday’s play in the six warm-up tournaments being contested at Melbourne Park was postponed.Depending on test results, those events should resume on Friday, with a busy day of tennis expected as organisers play catch-up.“We know that we have a period now where we have to work with those 507 players and their staff,” Tiley said. “The probability is very low that there’ll be an issue though.How Tennis Australia plans to squeeze all remaining matches in before Sunday would be announced later on Thursday, Tiley said, but asking some players to play two matches in one day is a likely scenario.With inclement weather forecast to hit Melbourne on Friday, Tiley said matches would be played on courts under roofs.The draw for the Open was scheduled to be made behind closed doors on Thursday evening but will now take place on Friday afternoon.The delay should allow for all test results to be returned and, assuming there are no positives, a full draw will be able to be made, with the tournament referee Wayne McEwen in attendance.“It will be a smaller version to what we’ve done before because the focus is to get the draw done and get it out there so everyone can start planning what they are doing Monday and who they are watching,” Tiley said.“We will make the decisions on which halves play where by Saturday as we’ve got to get through quite a few matches on Friday.”Tiley said most of the players were taking the latest setback to their preparations for the Open in their stride.“The players have been remarkable,” Tiley said. “They’ve been 14 days in quarantine, some of them longer, and it took them a while to get used to that as we all know with their comments.“But the majority have been fantastic ... when we made the calls last night and this morning they completely accepted it and have all gone and got tested.“They’ve been very appreciative of the opportunity to play and I had a number of calls late last night and also this morning from them confirming that we want this to happen and we will do whatever.”Earlier on Thursday, Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, Prof Allen Cheng, said the risk to players and their support staff who had been quarantining at the Grand Hyatt hotel of contracting the virus was low.“That said, the last case to leave the hotel for the health hotel left on the 22nd so we’re now getting on to close to 14 days since that time. So we think that risk is relatively low so we’re testing them to be sure, and it’s precautionary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67d60e8c82592b99a277080c0e7d58f00a3365ff/85_226_4801_2880/master/4801.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=212344d3b522ec633928d5f8408a2b19","title":"no touchscreens more space welcome to the post pandemic office","story":"With new safety protocols prompting design changes, traditional office spaces may be a thing of the pastThe pandemic has shown us that work can go on without a workplace. If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better. When we talk about our ServiceNow products and how we would use this, reserving your seat or desk in the office will be ‘normal’,” he says.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

But making the adjustment can be difficult without the proper tools and supportSince the coronavirus crisis began, many of us have adjusted to a hybrid work life that combines working from home with time in the office. But combining these two different styles of working can be a challenge, and employees and employers each have important roles to play to ease the transitions and dispel some common misunderstandings about how to be effective in a rapidly evolving working environment.Below are some of the popular misconceptions about hybrid working that may be ready for retirement.Hybrid working inhibits an organisation’s responsivenessIn fact, businesses have been able to be highly responsive to changes – for instance, when the pandemic’s second lockdown began, businesses were able to shift their workforces back to a work-from-home paradigm with relative ease. Hybrid work arrangements, moreover, allow companies to potentially shift the weight of their workforces in either direction – either toward more remote or more in-office hours – as needed as the pandemic and public policy play out.Organisations have also been quick to respond to new health and safety requirements to keep customers safe – with retailers pivoting to online and click and collect models, even if this wasn’t a core channel for them before. Aldi supermarket, for example, changed its business model to offer online deliveries in response to customers needing to isolate this year. The new service meant it could retain customers, rather than see them going elsewhere.Hybrid working diminishes company culture While it’s obviously harder to foster a shared workplace culture, many companies have found ways to strengthen professional bonds among team members through virtual social events and other activities. ServiceNow, the leading digital workflow company, has offered wellbeing activities to employees, their families and friends, including fitness events, engagement exercises that allow employees to share news and achievements, and an allowance that tangibly boosts an employee’s wellbeing.A culture of innovation should be accessible to employees regardless of where they are working, says Nerys Mutlow, innovation evangelist at ServiceNow, and companies should make a point of demonstrating and sharing how iniduals are being innovative while working remotely, which reinforces culture irrespective of physical location.The hybrid work model impedes mental health and wellness Many companies have been implementing mental health-focused support strategies. “We are mindful that the pandemic has taken its toll on people’s mental health and wellbeing,” says Susanna Yallop, chief people officer at Starling Bank. At the start of lockdown, for instance, the bank launched an internal employee initiative, called Never Home Alone, focused on mind, body, nutrition and personal development, through a series of online events and workshops. Ensuring support is in place and having a holistic approach to health, coupled with the increasing flexibility of hybrid working, can only improve mental health moving forwards.It reinforces outdated gender norms The many reports that working from home has turned back the clock on gender roles, because it leaves women to manage the bulk of childcare and housework, must be taken seriously. But as more working parents negotiate the proper balance of work and parenting, there is also more evidence that fathers are rising to the challenge. For instance, Mutlow says, she’s observed a noticeable increase in dads at school gates, which is an encouraging sign that more couples are challenging traditional stereotypes while providing healthy role models for children.Hybrid working is a waste of office spaceTop architects and designers are already well on their way to creating the post-pandemic office, including new models of desk density, ventilation and common work spaces. The changes will require getting used to, of course, but with change comes innovation, and, in the future, office space may be better used for creative collaborations and knowledge sharing.Hybrid working requires complex technologyThe Covid era has accelerated the demand for technology and collaboration tools that increase productivity, engagement and customer relationships. The digital workflows platform provided by ServiceNow, for instance, has shown that digitising processes makes employees’ jobs easier, which leads to higher levels of workforce engagement and productivity. Those digital innovations have also enhanced the safety of the office environment. Mutlow says: “We’ve created applications to manage the workplace environment safely and we ensure we educate and disseminate the information about what is needed before going into the office, so employees are mentally prepared about what to expect.” For instance, ServiceNow has built a suite of return-to-work applications that enable employees to check-in on their mobile the day before coming into the office and tell employers if they have any symptoms, and book a desk.“It’s important,” Mutlow adds, “that when people do return to the office that they know it’s safe.”ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better – no matter the circumstances. So employees can be productive, wherever they are.

Here’s how companies can put their employees’ mental health firstJill was on her way back from a funeral in September, when the message from her line manager arrived in her inbox. It explained that the insurance company she works for had decided that staff needed to begin returning to the office to help keep the business functioning.“It was very uncomfortable as I have two children with underlying health conditions,” she says. “If they got sick, it could be deadly, but my manager was adamant that I needed to return.”With the Covid-19 pandemic set to stretch into 2021, managers can perhaps be forgiven for growing impatient with the disruption posed by remote working. In a bid to get back to a sense of normality, it can be all too easy to unwittingly pressure staff to return to the office, regardless of government advice for people to work from home where possible.Well-meaning encouragement can be misinterpreted by anxious employees as overt pressure. And that pressure can spread through different departments and teams, quickly evolving into a new kind of workplace bullying. There have been a spate of incidents in the UK in which bosses have been accused of bullying staff to return to the office.This highlights the importance of properly supporting employees’ psychological safety as well as their physical safety. “Employers should take on any Covid related queries and try to support their employees as much as possible,” says psychiatrist Sarmila Sinha. “Don’t play down the risk of the Covid pandemic, and make the safety of the employee a priority.”Still, well-meaning actions can be felt as pressure, intimidation, and shaming. While management emails may say no one should feel under pressure to return to the office, this message is effectively contradicted by remarks made during video call meetings – or by managers’ social media posts that applaud those who “bravely” come into HQ. Managers may even reward those who come into the office with one-to-one lunches or meetings that basically function as career discussions, while neglecting to hold video-call equivalents for those working remotely.Mental health professionals point out that this subtle bullying can be counterproductive from a business perspective, as well as being a failure of corporate responsibility. Many workers are already struggling under the economic pressures of the pandemic, so when managers trigger even more anxiety, remote employees can find it harder to focus – thus undermining the practice of remote working and setting off a vicious cycle. Research has long shown there are strong business reasons for employers to take the mental wellbeing of their staff into account, given that healthy employees are more engaged, more productive, and have much lower rates of sickness absence.Employers need to have a healthy dialogue with their staff about working practices in the short to medium term, taking into account each employee’s home circumstances. Some might be living with people in at-risk groups. Others may be struggling with isolation and may actually welcome the opportunity to return to the office.“As an employer, it’s important not to make assumptions about how staff feel about working remotely or returning to their workplace, and remember everyone’s situation is different,” says Faye McGuinness, head of workplace wellbeing programmes at the mental health charity, Mind. “Offer phased returns, or the option of working from home more regularly. You may have to consider options that make journeys into work safer, such as adjustments to working hours. Regularly surveying staff and asking for anonymous feedback is a great way to identify themes and concerns.”McGuinness says it is crucial for employers to make sure staff feel that their voices are being heard regarding any plans to reopen the workspace. Instead of directly asking them whether they want to be in the office or not, a more empathetic approach is to task questions such as: “Do you feel like you need to stay at home in order to be safe right now?” or “Do you feel like you are getting what you need from us in order to do your job?”Software company ServiceNow offers a Safe Workplace Suite of applications to help companies plan a safe return to the office. This includes an Employee Readiness Survey, which helps gauge which staff are ready to go back to their workplace by taking account of their views and assessing their physical and mental health.But holding responsible conversations around workplace location is just one aspect of helping employees with their emotional and psychological wellbeing, particularly as new lockdown mandates are put into place.As a guide for both business leaders and employees, Mind recommends these five ways to wellbeing – connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. Each encompasses evidence-based ways for thinking about mental health both inside and outside of work.Over the past seven months, ServiceNow has implemented similar mental wellness strategies in a remote working environment. “We feel that attending to our employee wellbeing and mental health is more important now than ever,” says Laurent Briant, director of government programmes for ServiceNow’s NextGen programme. “This is a marathon and not a sprint.” Briant says that ServiceNow pays particular attention to the risk of employee burnout, using automated reminders to encourage employees to take regular breaks during the working day and emphasising the need for employees to use their annual leave and prioritise self-care.Sinha agrees on the importance of work-life balance when working from home. “Often employees working remotely feel obliged to work without taking their annual leave or asking for a day off,” she says. “Senior managers and supervisors can offer support to address burnout by reviewing employees’ working hours and ensuring staff are taking breaks while remotely working.”ServiceNow has rolled out a range of programmes aimed at promoting good mental health, including virtual socials to help people feel connected to online workshops offering practical guidance for parents. Central to all this is an understanding that every person’s working environment is different, and that flexibility – both in working hours and when employees are able to be available – is crucial to avoiding burnout and managing the stresses of daily life.One last, critical key to successfully address mental health issues in the workplace is to identify and take responsibility for the source of the problem. “The biggest problem we have regarding mental health issues in the workplace is our tendency to think of these conditions as something to do with the inidual,” says James Wallace, an academic at Swansea University who researches mental health in the workplace. “Rather than thinking about why they might have these experiences, for example because they’re overworked or they have a poor relationship with their boss.”While offering counselling services to employees is a start, Wallace encourages business leaders to look more deeply within the company culture to identify the root cause. “Unless employers are willing to accept that they have a responsibility for the working conditions of employees and make efforts to try to improve these conditions where necessary,” Wallace says, “then we are likely to continue to see employee burnout increase.”The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening. Including engaging with employees in advance, automating steps for returning, and providing a safe, employee‑ready working environment.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

Following his vehicle’s explosion, DiMeo was hospitalized for more than four months in the burns unit of a New Jersey hospital, including over two months in a medically induced coma. His fingertips had been amputated, face severely scarred, and lips and eyelids removed. The surgeries diminished his vision, mobility and quality of life.After nearly two dozen reconstructive surgeries, DiMeo remained on the donor registry for 10 months before finding a donor for the face transplant. The donor was transferred to NYU Langone on 10 August, and DiMeo was in the operating room just two days later.“This is a once-in-a-lifetime gift, and I hope the family can take some comfort knowing that part of the donor lives on with me,” DiMeo said. “My parents and I are very grateful that I’ve been given this second chance.”The coronavirus pandemic threatened the 22-year-old’s surgery, partly because organ donations had plummeted in the first months. Many members of DiMeo’s transplant team were also temporarily reassigned to work in emergency and pandemic response units.Still, Rodriguez noted that doctors “practiced the surgery nearly a dozen times over the course of a year”.A team of more than 140 healthcare professionals raced against time so they could limit the amount of time the donated tissue went without receiving a blood supply, transplanting both hands up to the mid-forearm. DiMeo’s face, including the forehead, eyebrows, ears, nose, eyelids, lips and skull line, cheek, nasal and chin bone, were also transplanted.The operation, which took 23 hours, should allow DiMeo to perform normal functions including dressing and feeding himself. Using free weights, he has started strength and resistance training, playing with his dog, Buster, and has even started practicing his golf swing.“The rehabilitation demands on Joe are greater than any of our previous face transplant patients,” Rodriguez said. “He’s completely focused on his goal of gaining greater independence and freedom.”Two other simultaneous face and hand transplant have been attempted in the past, although with starkly different outcomes. One patient ultimately died from complications related to an infection. Another prior recipient had the hands removed after their body failed to accept them.“Joe was an ideal candidate for this procedure he’s extremely motivated and dedicated to recovering the independence he lost after his accident,” Rodriguez told The Today Show.DiMeo has, so far, not experienced any rejection to the transplant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5336207e193d57fb93840ca4b4e662cdfa039312/0_18_3887_2334/master/3887.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6b8bbd3f4f73d857eb77bc725d137264","title":"lost on the frontline covid nurse coronavirus","story":"Yolanda Coar was 40 when she died of Covid-19 in August 2020 in Augusta, Georgia.

There were 19,202 more cases reported on Wednesday and 32,851 people are still in hospital. The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, who joined Johnson at his briefing on Wednesday, said it was too early to see any positive impact from the vaccinations because so many had taken place so recently.The prime minister also promised he would say “a bit more” in mid-February about future phases of the vaccination programme, including the second wave covering 18- to 49-year-olds without serious medical conditions.Police, teachers and other key workers have been pressing for priority in the next wave, although the government has refused to give any assurances or timetables. When asked at the Downing Street press conference whether the whole adult population could receive a first jab by May and a second by August, Whitty described that idea as “very optimistic”.Earlier Matt Hancock, the health secretary, warned there was not enough Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine available to open vaccination centres for 24 hours a day, despite promises last month from Johnson to go “to 247 as soon as we can”. “The rate-limiting factor is supply,” the minister said.GPs said that the pace of the programme – nearly 600,000 people received a first dose on the busiest day so far – had been possible partly because it built on the existing NHS experience in delivering flu jabs for older people every winter.Some of those involved in the national effort voiced concern about whether nurses, doctors and administrative staff could continue at the current pace for many months at a time, when many were already working seven days a week.“I worry how sustainable it is,” one London GP said. “It’s not just the doctors, it’s the pharmacists, the administrators who are making this happen.”NHS insiders said they expected to open “a cohort” of new vaccination centres in the coming days to relieve the pressure on GPs, for which those eligible could book appointments online.Public health experts said there was now a case that the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine should be rolled out faster in hotspot areas after research released on Tuesday suggested it could cut transmission of the virus by two-thirds.Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said jabs should now be used to prevent spread of the disease, not just to halt serious illness and death. The effect on transmission was “undoubtedly the best news we have had”, he added.Sir Richard Leese, the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester, added that his region wanted to speed up the vaccine rollout in more deprived communities, including among black and ethnic minority groups.“We should be prioritising those people who are most at risk and all the evidence says that people in more economically deprived communities, people from some minority ethnic communities, are more at risk than the general population,” Leese said.Britain has also been helped by the fact it has more available vaccine than many other countries, because of a deal with AstraZeneca last May to ensure its own supply in the UK. England has completed 8.663m initial vaccinations, Scotland 649,262, Wales 462,497 and Northern Ireland 246,671."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01dec1416e0c73413d6fbfc151aaa7da81575457/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbc217a02e14b4ea9defe12f3096f0bb","title":"about 4000 covid variants across world uk minister","story":"Nadhim Zahawi says Britain is storing mutations so it is better prepared to update vaccinesThere are roughly 4,000 variants of Covid-19 around the world, according to the UK vaccines minister, who said the British government was storing the mutations so it was better prepared to update vaccines as needed.Nadhim Zahawi told Sky News there was a “library” of coronavirus mutations being stored to make sure the UK could respond appropriately.Concerning variants have been identified in California, South Africa and Brazil, as well as the UK. Zahawi said: “There are about 4,000 variants around the world of Covid now. He said manufacturers including PfizerBioNTech, Moderna and OxfordAstraZeneca were looking at how they could improve their vaccines to be ready for any variant.The government’s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.In a separate interview with BBC Breakfast, Zahawi said infection transmission studies among vaccinated care home residents and frontline healthcare workers would provide more information on a roadmap for reopening the economy. “One is in care homes where Public Health England are testing residents because they are in category one, and one with health frontline workers who are category two of that top nine.“Those pieces of evidence, coupled with other pieces of evidence from other countries as well, will hopefully give us a very clear roadmap to opening the economy where we see a huge reduction, hopefully, in deaths and hospitalisation.”When pushed on when the first nine groups in the priority list would have received their vaccine, he said people could “do the maths”. He told BBC Breakfast: “We will set out our target (for vaccinating groups 5-9) after we have hit our February 15 target. But you can do the maths. We did 600,000 in a single day – the deployment infrastructure that we’ve built can do as many vaccines as we get supply, so the limiting factor will be vaccine supply. “You can see that in the next 10 or so days, we’ve got to do another almost touching 5 million and so if we keep that rate up we will very quickly go down the list of the top nine.” Asked whether that meant it would take another 35 days from 15 February to have jabbed all 31 million people in the first nine cohorts, Zahawi replied: “That assumes the supply, so I don’t want to commit to a date without going through it with a very fine-tooth comb with the whole team, because our limiting factor is the supply of vaccines ultimately. “With any manufacturing process, especially one that is new, there are challenges around that, as we’ve seen in Europe and as we saw in the early days in the UK as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26679bf7a51d9c40e0a9cd39737891df8bf797ca/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ab90613ccc7586844bf1683d2d350e","title":"beijing 2022 180 human rights groups call for winter olympics boycott","story":"More than 180 organisations want countries to skip event as a way of demonstrating their opposition to China’s rights recordMore than 180 human rights organisations have called for a boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games in protest against China’s mass human rights abuses.The coalition of groups – primarily regional associations in support of Tibet, Taiwan, the Uighur community and Hong Kong – said the hopes in 2015 that awarding Beijing the Games would be a catalyst for progress, had faded.“Since then … President Xi Jinping has unleashed an unrelenting crackdown on basic freedom and human rights,” the group said, calling on governments to boycott the event to ensure it wasn’t used to “embolden” the Chinese government as they said the 2008 summer Olympics had done.“Now, in 2021, we find ourselves back in the same position with the IOC who are refusing to act despite the clear evidence of genocide and widespread and worsening human rights failures.”In recent years its government and senior officials have been subjected to various sanctions and multilateral statements of condemnation, which have done little to change the behaviour.But there appears little appetite from countries for a boycott, including in the US, which has formally declared that China’s abuses in Xinjiang to amount to genocide.“We’re not currently talking about changing our posture or our plans as it relates to the Beijing Olympics,” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Wednesday.The US Olympic and Paralympic Committee said it believed it was more effective for governments to engage China directly on human rights concerns, and boycotts “have been shown to negatively impact athletes while not effectively addressing global issues”.Asked about the letter, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said at a regular press briefing “all Winter Games lovers are looking forward to taking part in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics”.“We are fully confident the Beijing Winter Olympics will be a splendid event. In the meantime I must point out that it is highly irresponsible for some parties to try and disrupt, intervene, and sabotage the preparation and holding of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games to serve their political interests,” Wang said.“Such actions will not be supported by the international community and will never succeed.”It came as Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the IOC of failing its due diligence in not conducting a human rights risk assessment.“The IOC knows the Chinese authorities are arbitrarily detaining Uighurs and other Muslims, expanding state surveillance, and silencing numerous peaceful critics,” said Sophie Richardson, HRW’s China director. “Its failure to publicly confront Beijing’s serious human rights violations makes a mockery of its own commitments and claims that the Olympics are a ‘force for good’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Push for environmental regulations has alienated voters in the American MidwestNew appointments to Climate Change Advisory Council coinciding with enhanced roleMove will end fossil fuel prospecting and the future development of oil and gas fields"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Government and its agencies finally taking threats of storms seriously"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4475966.1612425655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"breastcheck screenings fell by more than two thirds in 2020","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE said BreastCheck ‘does not aim to catch up on issuing outstanding invitations in the short term’. Photograph: iStock The number of mammograms carried out by the HSE’s BreastCheck screening service fell by more than two-thirds in 2020, leading to the detection of 600 fewer breast cancers.Some 56,000 women had a full mammogram last year compared to more than 170,000 in 2019, a drop of 114,000, and mammogram numbers this year are expected to be behind again as BreastCheck operates a coronavirus-affected service.The average number of cancers detected by BreastCheck each year is 1,050. Warning that delays will continue, the HSE said BreastCheck “does not aim to catch up on issuing outstanding invitations in the short term”.The current delays will mean that many women will get a BreastCheck screening every three years, rather than the recommended two-yearly check.When targets for 2020 are examined, the drop in mammograms is even higher than 114,000, since it had been planned to carry out 128,000 more mammograms last year than were actually possible to do.Appointments ceased“The pause in screening was put in place to protect participants and staff by complying with social distancing guidelines. When screening was paused, the arranging of appointments ceased,” said a HSE spokeswoman.According to the HSE, a significant number of women attending BreastCheck are in a vulnerable age category for contracting the virus, as it caters for women aged 50-69. BreastCheck carries out mammograms on healthy women only. Appointments for routine screening will resume when it is deemed safe to ask women to reattend, according to HSE clinical director of BreastCheck Prof Ann O’Doherty. Acknowledging the impact of the virus, Prof O’Doherty said: “Most years we pick up six cancers in every 1,000 women we screen. We’ve screened much less so there are hundreds of women we haven’t diagnosed. “We know that and we are desperate to get back screening,” she said, adding that women with breast cancer are still receiving treatment and anyone with symptoms should seek advice.Women who require “further assessment” are being seen in follow-up clinics and the HSE has urged those undergoing follow-up treatment to attend their appointments. Noting the pressures created by the virus on the State’s hospitals, she said: “The truth of the matter is we are not able to treat people in the normal way because hospitals are full of Covid patients. “We don’t save lives by doing a mammogram. We save their lives by treating patients and getting them to hospital and operating. That is a huge problem in Covid times because hospitals are inundated with sick people.“It’s very hard to get people in at the moment. We’re not ignoring screening but we have to do what is going to give the best outcome in Covid times,” she told The .Despite the problems, the health service was treating the same number of women for breast cancer as it had been at the end of 2019: “So that was good. People were very frightened at the start and didn’t come in. “Then it stabilised and overall we don’t think that we had a lot of people not coming in,” she said, though it will be impossible fully to catch up with the screenings missed during the pandemic.This is because of a lack of trained personnel required to ramp up screening, she said, adding that it takes 15 years to train a breast radiologist and seven years to train a radiographer. Concerns“It’s absolutely unrealistic to think that we are going to catch up. We’re going to keep going and get as many through the system as possible. We will probably have in the next year or two some women going out to three years, which would be the norm in the UK. We’d love to get everyone back at two years.BreastCheck is a screening service for well women, and not a symptomatic service, so women with concerns should immediately contact their GP for referral on to hospital clinics that are still fully working.However, women with symptoms of breast cancer have avoided presenting for investigation because of their fears about contracting the virus, according to a leading expert, Arnold Hill, professor of surgery and head of the medical school at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland (RCSI).“I think there are a number of people who are obviously concerned and are opting not to come. There is no question about that. It’s very hard in a Level 5 lockdown though, because people themselves are often not certain about what is normal and who can blame them,” he said. “Understandably, patients have fears and concerns about attending hospital but we still want to see a woman with a possible lump to make sure they don’t have cancer and if they do, we’re here to treat them.Despite the challenges, Beaumont Hospital, where Prof Hill works as a breast and endocrine surgeon, detected more cancers last year than the year before, making 380 diagnoses in 2019 and more than 400 in 2020. When caught early, breast cancer, the second most common cancer in women in Ireland, has an 85 per cent survival rate after five years. About 700 women die from the disease every year. One in 10 will be diagnosed with it during their lifetime. The chairman of the charity Breast Cancer Ireland (BCI), Prof Hill said new research has found an existing cancer drug, Dasatinib, can have a “helpful effect” in treating aggressive breast cancers, combined with chemotherapy. Known as triple negative breast cancers, or TNBCs, they occur in younger women as well as those who are older, grow rapidly and are challenging to treat. Few young women treated for TNBCs later can have children.The research was led by Dr Paul Mullan at Queen’s University Belfast. Welcoming the development, the chief executive of BCI Aisling Hurley said it hopes one day to make breast cancer “a long-term treatable disease”. To mark World Cancer Day on Thursday the Irish Cancer Society is urging people to contact their doctor if they are concerned about symptoms that may indicate cancer. Eight signs of breast cancerThe eight signssymptoms to be aware of in self-examination are: – Puckering of the skin of the breast – Lump in breast or armpit – Change in skin around nipple or nipple discharge – Dimpling of the nipple or nipple retraction – Unusual increase in the size of one breast – One breast unusually lower than the other – nipples at different levels – Enlargement of the glands – Unusual swelling in the armpit Regular updates to screening schedule changes are available at breastcheck.ie.

This may come in time  but it isn’t there now, at least not at a level to satisfy the Irish (and German) authorities. Photograph: Getty imagesIreland’s decision to favour the PfizerBioNTech and Moderna vaccines over AstraZeneca’s for over-70s, while leaving it open to people of all ages to avail of any of the three, represents a middle way among the options available.While the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last week authorised the easier-to-handle and cheaper AstraZeneca vaccine, German, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their over-65s. Yesterday, Switzerland decided not to authorise it for any age-group, due to insufficient data on its efficacy.The decision by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac), approved by the Department of Health, will force considerable reorganisation in Ireland’s vaccination rollout, but nothing that is insuperable.The AstraZeneca vaccine was touted – foolishly, with the benefit of hindsight – as a “game-changer” for the rollout, because it can be stored by a GP or pharmacist in a normal fridge and administered locally, close to where people live.In contrast, the two mRNA vaccines (PfizerBioNTech and Moderna) are harder to handle because they require cold storage in transportation. The issues around AstraZeneca’s treatment relate to effectiveness, not safety. The EMA accepted its efficacy as 60 per cent, based on the studies presented, lower than for the two other authorised vaccines.Insufficient clinical dataIn the rush to develop the vaccine, there is insufficient clinical data on its efficacy among those aged 55 and older, as Niac noted. This may come in time, as more people are administered the vaccine in the real world, but it isn’t there now, at least not at a level to satisfy the Irish (and German) authorities.Niac, after some days of deliberation, has taken the common-sense approach that says “the best vaccine anyone can receive at this time is the vaccine that can be soonest administered”. Its decision, though, places the health service in something of a quandary. What should it do with the first AstraZeneca vaccines arriving from next week? Give them to the over-70s, the next priority group, or ert them to other categories further down the Government’s sequencing list?And, if it does decide to use the two other vaccines on the over-70s, how can this be managed, given the storage and transportation difficulties involved.One option would be to let older people choose, possibly between receiving an earlier dose of AstraZeneca or a later one of one of the other two vaccines.The more likely option is to “turn the ship around” and find a way of vaccinating as many high-risk older people, as quickly as possible, with the PfizerBioNTech or Moderna products. These are more suited to distribution at large vaccination sites, where high volumes can be dealt with daily. Lead the wayBut Israel has shown how to lead the way by employing creative technical responses to the demanding cold storage requirements of the Pfizer vaccine. The company had specified that vials, when removed from ultra low-temperature freezers, should be transported only in large trays, enough for 1,000 doses. However, Israeli experts realised this limited their ability to reach nursing homes and other small centres, so they repacked their stocks into pizza-box size consignments.At the same time, AstraZeneca stocks could be stretched to administer a first dose to the maximum number of under-65s, because Niac has approved an interval of up to 12 weeks before a second dose is given to this group. The recommended interval for over-65s is four to six weeks.There are still plenty of health workers who need to be vaccinated, so the initially limited stocks of AstraZeneca to arrive here will not want for usage.Despite the turbulence around vaccine supplies in the EU over the past fortnight, there is growing clarity around what Ireland and other member states can expect to receive in the coming months. While the lack of figures about the numbers of people vaccinated with each vaccine, in each priority category, in each part of the country, is alarming, Ireland has started better than most of the EU in rolling out vaccines.Now that the rules of engagement have been clarified by Niac, it behoves the Government, the department and the vaccine rollout taskforce to quickly set out their detailed schedules for the rollout over the coming period."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4474477.1612297314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse has sufficient stock of medical grade face masks as usage increases from surge","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe HSE acknowledges updated guidance on the situations where FFP2 masks should be used will lead to an “ongoing and significant increase in demand for the medium term”. Photograph:  Nicolas TucatAFP via Getty ImagesThe Health Service Executive says it has sufficient supplies of medical-grade face masks to protect against Covid-19 despite a more than 10-fold increase in usage during the third wave.Demand for FFP2 masks has soared with the massive increase in cases during the third wave of the pandemic and growing demand among staff for higher levels of protection.The HSE acknowledges updated guidance on the situations where FFP2 masks should be used will lead to an “ongoing and significant increase in demand for the medium term”.However, a spokeswoman said existing stock levels would continue to meet this demand “in the short term” while additional sources for buying the masks have been secured. Fresh deliveries of these supplies are due to start next week.“No stock shortfalls are envisaged,” she added.An FFP2 respirator is a tight-fitting mask, which creates a seal around the face and filters both the inflow and outflow of air. The use of such masks was made mandatory in Austria last month for public transport, hospitals and shops, while Germany also demands the use of medical-grade masks in many situations.Under the revised HSE guidelines, healthcare workers should have access to a “well-fitted respirator mask such as an FFP2 and eye protection when in contact with possible or confirmed Covid-19 cases and contacts.However, the surge in demand has caused delays in fitting, leading to concerns that staff could be at risk if they use poorly-fitted masks.Figures released by the HSE to The  show the massive volume of PPE required by the health service to protect staff during the pandemic.Last year, the health service used 167 million surgical masks and 4.4 million FFP2 masks.It also went through 157 million nitrile or vinyl gloves, 60.5 million disposable aprons, 2.5 million goggles, over 5 million hand gel dispensers and 1.4 million protective suits. The latest supply to the HSE saw 15.4 million PPE items delivered last Monday.Alarmed by what it says is an “unacceptably high” number of infections among its members, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has raised the issue of increased protection with the HSE over the past month, and with the Health and Safety Authority. “The INMO has secured that the standard level of mask available to you should be increased to a properly fitted FFP2 mask,” it told members last week.National Public Health Emergency Team officials said last week they were examining the Austrian initiative but stressed that supplies of medical-grade masks for health staff must be protected.Assistant chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn urged people not to get “overly concerned” about the type of mask they were, but to focus on wearing one when required.Demand among frontline staff for gowns and eye protection has also increased significantly due to the surge of cases after Christmas, the HSE says, but future supplies for most personal protective equipment are forecast to be “strong and stable”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4475492.1612389361!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"older people may face vaccine delay as hse scrambles to revise rollout after advice on astrazeneca","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Covid-19 HSE vaccination sign in Baldoyle, Dublin.

Photograph: Alan Betson The State’s plan for the rollout of coronavirus vaccines will be significantly reworked following a decision to recommend the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for people over 70 where possible.People aged between 70-80 could be facing delays of two-three weeks for their vaccination under changes being drawn up by health officials.At the same time, three cohorts are likely to be brought forward from next week onwards including healthcare workers who are not in direct contact with patients, people between the age of 65 and 69 and key workers, sources said last night.The changes are being drawn up after chief medical officer Tony Holohan advised that those over 70 should be given the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, rather than the recently approved AstraZeneca shot. In a letter, he also advised that those over 65 living and working in long-term residential care should also be given these vaccines due to the increased risk in those settings.The use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are based on a new technology called mRNA, in a GP setting had been seen as a challenge due to the demands of storing and administering them, as they need to be kept at ultra-low temperatures.Officials are now scrambling to revise the vaccination schedule after a series of high-level meetings in recent days. However, it is understood that there will no changes to the vaccine schedule for those aged over 80, as they were due to receive the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines anyway. The challengesA HSE source said that they will have to “get creative” in finding ways to make the new vaccine plan work, adding that the challenge should not be underestimated.One of the options being considered is bringing GPs together in groups, such as at pop-up vaccine areas in community centres, to more easily administer the sensitive mRNA vaccines to those over 70. Meanwhile some 35,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are due to be delivered here next week.Dr Holohan gave his advice to the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly after a report from the expert group on immunisation. The report from the National Immunisation Advisory Council (Niac) recommended that vaccination of over 70s should not be delayed but that where “practical and timely” the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should be used.However, the Government said that after Dr Holohan’s advice to Government, the HSE would not administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to anyone over 70.Lower priority groups may be inoculated earlier than was originally anticipated as a result of the decision, one senior source indicated.Different cohortsOfficials are looking at administering vaccines to different cohorts “in parallel rather than in sequence” in order to make maximum use of supplies, according to the source.“We aim to complete our deliberation before the weekend, so by then we should know where we’re going.”Officials are said to be looking at a range of options to accommodate the logistical challenges of transporting, distributing and administering the mRNA vaccines in community settings.This may require further consultation with representative bodies such as the Irish Medical Organisation, it was indicated.Although supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Ireland are confirmed only up to the end of this month, officials say they are reassured by recent announcements by the manufacturers of the three authorised vaccines.Further detail on vaccine deliveries, and when doses will be administered to each priority group, is expected next week.Despite supply issues, Ireland’s rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is currently the fastest in Europe. Ireland and Denmark have administered doses to 4.1 per cent of their populations, the highest uptake of the 25 countries tracked by the European Centre for Disease Control."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4475394.1612380623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid business supports set to be extended beyond march","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar will chair a meeting to review the impact of the third wave of Covid and the associated lockdown on the economy. Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyThe Government is set to extend pandemic-era business supports beyond their expiry date at the end of next month, with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar saying they “cannot end on March 31st”.A key Cabinet subcommittee will meet on Thursday to discuss extensions to the scheme and assess measures for sectors fundamentally exposed to the impact of Covid-19.The future requirements of industries such as aviation, tourism, hospitality and entertainment, which will face “prolonged difficulties”, will also be on the agenda of a Cabinet subcommittee on the economy, a spokesman for the Department of Business said.The meeting, chaired by Mr Varadkar, will review the impact of the third wave of Covid and the associated lockdown on the economy, as well as the vaccine rollout and Brexit.Extensions to the pandemic unemployment payment (PUP), employment wage subsidy scheme (EWSS) and Covid restrictions support scheme (CRSS) will be discussed, as will proposals to support businesses that do not qualify for weekly payments.Speaking before the meeting, Mr Varadkar told The  in a statement that programmes such as these “cannot end on March 31st as many businesses will still be closed by then and will still need help even after they reopen”.“Government has yet to make a decision on these matters but I think we all agree that it would help build confidence if a decision is made on extending these programmes this month, rather than waiting until next.”Extra borrowingThe committee will also discuss how to deploy the €1 billion awarded to the state under the Brexit Adjustment Reserve and the National Recovery Fund.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath will update the committee on the public finances, while Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys will present employment data.Government sources said that the impact of the pandemic on the economy and public finances, as well as the ongoing cost of pandemic supports – estimated at about €1 billion a month – will form part of the meeting.Sources said there is a growing view that the worst economic effects of Covid are concentrated in a few sectors, with some confidence drawn from recent income tax and VAT returns.However, the ongoing impact of the pandemic and the harsh lockdown associated with the third wave has pushed back any discussion of tapering supports, most likely until the third quarter of the year, sources said. The prospect of topping up about €5.5 billion in Brexit and Covid contingency funds with extra borrowing is also likely to be discussed.‘No cliff edge’Mr Varadkar said the budget was predicated on pessimistic assumptions around Brexit and vaccine development. However, while both have turned out better than expected, he said “we did not expect a prolonged third wave and lockdown that is having a very negative impact on employment and business”.Speaking in the Dáil on Wednesday, Mr Donohoe said businesses affected by the pandemic are expected to require support until the end of the year.Mr Donohoe pledged in a Dáil debate that there would be no “cliff edge” to the EWSS that provides a subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of employees.The scheme is due to finish at the end of March but can be extended to the end of June under current legislation. Mr Donohoe said that the operation of the scheme and its effectiveness is under close review.He said there were “no plans to revisit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS” but “the Government’s position is that there will be no cliff edge to the EWSS”.Outlining details of Government supports, the Minister said the TWSS, in place from March until the end of August last year provided almost €2.9 billion subsidy to 66,500 employers for more than 664,000 employees. Under the EWSS direct subsidies of €1.7 billion were paid to 44,800 employers and 505,600 employees with €303 million in PRSI credit up to January 28th.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4475130.1612362343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"expanding lough forces elderly couple from roscommon home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEdward Beattie (82) stands in front of his house near Lough Funshinagh in Co Roscommon looking at flood waters creeping up towards his house last month. Photograph: supplied by familyA couple in their 80s were forced to evacuate their Roscommon home earlier this week fearing it would be imminently flooded.Edward John Beattie (82) has watched from his window over the past few weeks as the expanding Lough Funshinagh inched closer to his front door. The retired farmer said he was advised by senior Roscommon County Council officials on Monday to leave his house in Ballagh Cross, Rahara, where he has lived since 1951, as an embankment keeping the water at bay was at risk of collapsing.The bloated lake has already swallowed up more than 100 hectares (247 acres) of farmland and forced another local family to leave the area.“The last thing I want is to leave our house,” Mr Beattie said, “once you go you might never get back”.However, he had no choice but to move with his wife Teresa to private rented accommodation about 2.5km away on Tuesday.Locals have been sounding the alarm about the threat posed to their property since 2016. Lough Funshinagh is in fact a turlough – a type of disappearing lake – that drains gradually. In recent years it has not been receding as it used to. The council attributes the change in the lake’s behaviour to increased rainfall due to climate change, but the Office of Public Works (OPW) said the high water levels were “within the naturally occurring range”.Monitoring water levelsFollowing extreme flooding at Lough Funshinagh in 2016, Geological Survey Ireland began monitoring its water levels. Last week it published an updated assessment, finding Lough Funshinagh to be “unlike other turloughs in Ireland” as it “does not get the opportunity to reset its flood pattern each year”. It is “particularly vulnerable to weather events as their impacts can carry over one year to the next”, it said.Another Ballagh resident Mary Beattie (70), no relation, was advised to pack up her belongings due to the threat to her home also, but she is determined to “stand her ground”, her daughter Sinead Beattie said.“She told the council she will take her kettle upstairs and that is where they will find her . . . She feels if she does go they will just let the house flood. There is zero trust there with the Government,” she said.Her mother had already endured the most difficult year of her life, and the fear her home will be flooded is compounding matters, she said. Within the last year Mary Beattie has buried her husband and her 33-year-old daughter Sheila, who died from cancer.“My mother now only sleeps in my sister’s bed. How can she be asked to move out? It is not about the house or the money, it is about the memories . . . All of Sheila’s memories are in that house,” she said. If her mother were forced to relocate it would “break her heart”, Ms Beattie said.“We have seen our mother go through so much and if we can just save our home she could maybe find some peace.”The council has raised roads and provided pumps to residents whose homes were in danger of being flooded, while the OPW said it deployed an engineer over the weekend to review the situation. But Edward Beattie’s son Matthew Beattie said years of inaction have turned the local area into a “seaside”, with more homes at risk.“It is absolutely disgraceful that a family in their 80s have had to leave their home and move into private rental accommodation in the middle of a pandemic,” he said, adding that they had been cocooning since March.Mr Beattie believes the council “took their foot off the pedal completely” and didn’t take seriously enough the warnings from county councillors and Ballagh Cross residents.‘Driven to despair’“This should never have happened. There was a solution to this problem,” he said.A proposal by the council to insert an outflow pipe that would maintain the lake at a set level was rejected by the OPW in August 2020. The OPW said then that the €1.5 million proposal did not represent a “cost benefit” and was not a sustainable solution.Local independent councillor Laurence Fallon, whose own farmland has been affected by the lake’s expansion, said the village of Ballagh is “on a knife-edge”.“This issue has driven the entire village to despair . . . This is a massive problem doing massive damage to the environment and the locality,” he said.Chief executive of Roscommon County Council Eugene Cummins wrote to the Minister of State at the OPW, Patrick O’Donovan, last week urging him to reconsider funding the “already identified solution”. He said the situation had “deteriorated significantly” in recent days.“There is little Roscommon County Council can do in the context of a permanent significant infrastructural solution to alleviating this flooding without Government intervention,” he wrote.Even if given the green light, it would take about three years to complete the project, Mr Cummins said, imploring that a “hybrid interim mix of actions” be deployed in the meantime.In response, Mr O’Donovan said the outflow proposal “may raise environmental concerns” due to the designation of the turlough as a special area of conservation. However, he advised the council, as the lead agency, to initiate a planning process for an engineered solution. He asked Mr Cummins to convene a meeting of all relevant State bodies to identify further actions to address the issues. He gave his assurances that he and the Government are “fully committed to finding an effective and sustainable solution”.Cllr Fallon is more hopeful now of progress. “The only problem is that by the time we get there our village might not exist.”Brenda Fitzsimons takes a look at the recent flooding from an Irish Air Corps helicopterStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4463050.1611136718!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus family now a prime suspect in previous pandemics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘In the 21st century, there have been eight epidemic or pandemic viruses,’ says coronavirus researcher Prof Ralph Baric. ‘I don’t know if people are paying attention.’ Photograph: Getty ImagesScience Photo LibraCoronaviruses are a byword for inconvenience illness, disruption and death. Almost always in a contemporary setting we mean the pandemic virus that crept out of Wuhan in late 2019 and turned normality upside down for 2020.But this coronavirus is not a loner. It belongs to a large family of viruses ignored by infectious disease scientists for many years, yet now a prime suspect in causing previous pandemics.Veterinary virologists always recognised coronaviruses as menaces, inflicting new lethal diseases on farms. In the 1990s, a respiratory coronavirus devastated cattle herds. Before that, a diarrheal coronavirus disease emerged in pigs, spread around the world and killed millions of swine.Meanwhile, human coronavirus research remained a backwater. “It was just a bunch of coronavirus hobbyists doing research on human coronaviruses, because we weren’t getting funding,” says Dr Frank Esper, infectious disease clinician at the Cleveland Clinic in the US, who has studied “common cold” coronaviruses in patients.The Sars outbreak in 2003 upended assumptions about coronaviruses. The Sars virus spilled from bats to people in China, causing outbreaks also in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Canada, with high death rates. It pushed virologists to hunt for more human coronaviruses.Two had been identified in the 1960s, and two more common cold coronaviruses were discovered in patients after Sars. The forgettable names reflect how uninteresting most viewed them – OC43, 229E, NL63 and HK1.LessonsThese four coronaviruses receive little attention, yet “the endemic coronaviruses are still teaching us lessons”, says Prof Ralph Baric, a coronavirus researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For starters, each of these viruses probably sparked its own pandemic. And they show that reinfection with coronaviruses is the norm.Three jumped into people between 200 and 800 years ago from bats, says Baric. “They were probably quite severe, but were written off as flu.” Their hazy signatures are probably lost among many disease outbreaks in the Middle Ages.After Sars, scientists scrutinised the two known human coronaviruses (OC43 and 229E). Belgian coronavirus researcher Prof Marc Van Ranst sequenced the genome of OC43 in 2003. He reported that it originated in cattle or pigs and likely first infected people in the 1890s.Van Ranst blamed this virus for “the Russian flu”, a mysterious pandemic that began around 1890. Only a small band of coronavirus scientists took notice. Most, including Baric, now agree that OC43 from cattle likely caused the “Russian flu” in the late 19th century.Subsequent genetic studies of the 229E human coronavirus and its relatives in animals pointed to it origins in African bats, before it moved to camels, and then first infected people around the 18th century. It is now just one of dozens of respiratory viruses that inflict us with common cold symptoms.Baric, however, suspects that common cold coronaviruses cause more harm that is assumed. “During the Sars coronavirus-1 epidemic there was an outbreak in a retirement community in Canada that was initially diagnosed as SARS, but it turned out to be OC43,” recalls Baric. “It had a 10 per cent mortality rate in that retirement community.” Note that this is the virus blamed for the last coronavirus pandemic in the 1890s.Quickly dismissedImmunologist Dr Joseph Mizgerd, director of the pulmonary centre at Boston University School of Medicine, agrees such coronaviruses are too quickly dismissed. “Though we call them common cold coronaviruses, they can cause severe lung infections as well,” he adds. They also can be really important causes of pneumonia ranking seventh in the US.For most of us, we first catch common coronaviruses before the age of five. The infection is usually fairly mild, because it’s occurring in young children, Baric explains.Immunity to these viruses wanes after a year or so, especially in the nose, and you get reinfected every two to four years. Symptoms may be mild or non-existent. “It is not until people are much older or have underlying conditions that affect immune functions that they can become serious life-threatening illnesses,” he explains.Esper suspects endemic coronaviruses can cause bad lung infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy or anyone on immune-suppressing drugs, such as after an organ transplant. Since there are no effective antivirals for coronaviruses, however, clinicians see no urgency in testing for them – it won’t much influence treatment.The futureThe endemic coronaviruses can also offer a glimpse into the future of Sars-CoV-2. “A vaccine will take it out of the pandemic phase, but the virus will remain, like the other coronaviruses, and show up at certain times of year,” says Esper. He predicts it will still cause serious infections, like flu, but will become less severe with time.Experts disagree on whether we should invest in a vaccine for common cold coronaviruses. “It’s a few per cent of the pneumonia cases every year in the US,” says Mizgerd, who would welcome a vaccine. But other germs with no vaccine cause more illnesses and deaths.“I don’t think there’s going to be much push to get a vaccine for the other coronaviruses,” says Esper, because they are not major killers.Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the national virus reference laboratory in UCD, says there are higher priority viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which we need a vaccine for. But there are arguments for new coronavirus vaccines too, he accepts.There had been efforts to develop a vaccine for the sixth coronavirus discovered in humans – the middle eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) virus. This was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and mostly is contracted from camels. Some human-to-human transmission is possible, highlighted by hospital outbreaks in South Korea in 2015, triggered by a man who had returned from the Middle East. The Oxford vaccine group worked on a Mers vaccine, and this research quickened development of their Covid-19 vaccine.This tees up a reason to consider a vaccine for “common cold” coronaviruses. More experience here could edge us closer to a vaccine against multiple coronaviruses. “We need a universal coronavirus vaccine,” says Baric. “There’s still a large number of coronaviruses out there that have the potential to grow in human cells, so we really do need a vaccine against Mers, and various related strains.”Bat coronavirusIn 2018, scientists reported that a bat coronavirus killed almost 25,000 piglets in China, close to the origin of the first Sars virus. They dubbed the disease Sads (swine acute diarrhoea syndrome).Baric’s lab showed Sads coronavirus can grow in many human cells, including in lung and gut cells. It is a problem because “it could cause a global pandemic that would affect swine”, impacting food production, “but also has the potential to spill over into humans”, he warns. Its spike protein seems to be completely unique.There is no cross protection between contemporary coronavirus and this Sads virus, Baric adds, meaning infection with one would not protect you against the other. “The potential exists that you could have two or three coronaviruses within different genogroups co-circulating in human populations. That’s a little scary.”Baric argues that science and medical funders should push for a universal coronavirus vaccine, which would protect against endemic coronaviruses and hopefully new strains. There is also a population ready to trial a common coronavirus or universal coronavirus vaccine in – those in assisted living care facilities, where the common cold coronaviruses may be causing more deaths than we realise.Another pandemicWhile business representatives and politicians may describe the 2020 pandemic as a one-in-a-100-year event, many scientists and clinicians are not so sanguine. “This is not an isolated event,” Esper insists. “This is the third coronavirus to cause a global outbreak since the turn of the millennium,” he notes, before predicting that another pandemic is almost a certainty.This gloomy outlook is held by other virologists. “In the 21st century, there have been eight epidemic or pandemic viruses,” Baric points out. “I don’t know if people are paying attention. They need to realise that there’s a new epidemic or pandemic virus arriving every two to three years.”He suggests ecological changes we’ve wrought across the planet brought on this dire situation. Baric and others had warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic after Sars, and hoped for more research funding, but interest dried up as the Sars experience faded from memory.Fortunately, with the recent advances in vaccines for Covid-19, we are in a much better position to develop vaccines for current and emerging viruses. The crucial move will be not to drop the ball after this pandemic is finally brought under control by vaccines, and to get ready for another one. “We need to be better prepared,” Baric concludes."},{"url":null,"title":"army film photographic competition 2020","story":"Taking aim, the target in your sights, waiting for the exact moment to take that killer shot - this is the life of a soldier, and of a photographer - and in the Army Film and Photographic Competition the two mix seemlessly together. Open to regular and reservist soldiers, members of the combined cadet force, army cadet force and university officer training corps, as well as Ministry of Defence civilians who work directly for the army, the competition shines a light on a hidden world.

However, he is the ultimate boss and if he doesn’t like it, now is the time to bring back the hard shoulder and save lives.”Mr Shapps told MPs he had “inherited” the current smart motorway system and commissioned a review of it when he became transport secretary as he was concerned by reports of fatal crashes.He said he was surprised to learn the scheme had been launched without stop detection technology along all stretches and that shortages of kit from the sole supplier meant all smart motorways may not be covered for “many years”.Mr Shapps said: “It is entirely wrong to build a so-called smart motorway without the technology in place to make it safer. That is not the right approach.”He said he is now focused on making smart motorways safer and last year ordered 18 separate improvements, including building more emergency refuge areas and launching a £5 million driver safety information campaign.“People don’t know, as they were just sprung up, how they are meant to drive on these things,” he added. “Or what you should do if you break down on one of these things.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Schools will reopen on March 8, minister confirmsCoronavirus latest news: Community transmission now the key to lifting lockdown, insists Sage scientist Amphibian \u0026#39plague\u0026#39 that could be prevented using bacteria from surviving frogs Leading hotel group \u0026#39left in the dark\u0026#39 by Government over quarantine plans despite multiple offers of helpUS charges Seattle-based Proud Boys member for role in Capitol riotsThursday morning news briefing: Clamour for faster lifting of lockdownYou\u0026#39ll never walk alone: How Captain Sir Tom Moore captured our hearts in the hardest of times China and Russia threat means new chief of defence staff should be from Royal NavyYounger people could be given doses of two different Covid vaccinesChildren scared to go on playdates for fear \u0026#39someone will die as a result\u0026#39, headteacher claimsBritain risks becoming a \u0026#39monolingual society\u0026#39 after Brexit, headteachers warn amid steep decline in modern language degreesExclusive: Royal Mint hoping to break UK sales record with auction of rare Henry VII coinHealth chiefs issue warning over missed lung and prostate cancers, as tests referrals remain lowComment: Even with vaccines, an unreformed NHS may force us back into lockdownTokyo Olympics chief will not resign after saying women \u0026#39talk too much\u0026#39UK weather: Warning snow and rain to cause disruption in England and ScotlandMcKinsey \u0026#39settles for $573 million over role in opioid addiction crisis\u0026#39Republicans decide not to punish Marjorie Taylor Greene for supporting violence against DemocratsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"philip hammonds bogus brexit history reveals true hostility","story":"It is good medical practice to respect patient confidentiality, but when Philip Hammond took to the political equivalent of the psychiatrist’s couch, the conversation was published in gory detail. Hammond has given an interview to a think tank in which he sought to write a bogus history of the Brexit talks, but succeeded only in revealing what he really got up to as chancellor.Hammond admits discussing using a second referendum to overturn Brexit with fellow Remainers. He decided against, in part, because “we didn’t actually think we’d win it”. Instead, he makes clear, he worked to undermine what Brexit would mean. Despite claiming to accept the referendum result, it is not obvious what Hammond thought Britain should leave. The single market? No. The customs union? No. The writ of the European Court of Justice? That was just “theological argument.Nor is he keen on Britain’s new freedoms. Supporting immigration control is “dogmatic”, he suggests, and we should have kept free movement rules. Neither is there much to gain from regulating our own economy. “The Bank of England was always keener on regulatory autonomy than the Treasury was,” he says, as though the Treasury ran the man supposed to run it.Instead, Hammond wanted a “very close associated orbit with the European Union”, in which Brussels set the rules and Britain followed. How many Brits might have been vaccinated in Hammond’s fantasy polity? The answer is remarkably few.This all reflects the man with whom I worked as chief of staff in Downing Street from 2016 to 2017. Unable to resist jabbing at Leave-supporting politicians, envious of Boris Johnson, ignorant of Parliament, contemptuous of ordinary people, resistant to public opinion, reluctant to concede the reality of what Brexit must mean, incredulous that Theresa May, a woman he believed his inferior, could become prime minister, he details a fantasy of what might have been.But it is a fantasy. His account of May’s Brexit speech to the 2016 Tory conference makes no sense. He says she retreated from it in her Lancaster House speech, but there she went further, promising to leave the single market and customs union. Without challenge, Hammond claims May’s speech almost caused a run on sterling. But while sterling fell, the drama came almost a week later after a “flash crash” in Asian markets. Sterling promptly recovered, and an independent investigation blamed a “confluence of factors”, noting it was one of “a series of flash events occurring in fast, electronic markets”.There are further discrepancies. Hammond says he was never a Leaver, but those who worked for him say he boasted for years that Britain must leave the EU. He claims he supported a Norway-style relationship from the start, but he did not say so to May.Hammond’s sneering towards Davis is typical. “Just because he was called the Brexit Secretary,” Davis thought “he was somehow going to control some of this process.” But when the boot was on the other foot, and Hammond was the minister feeling disempowered, he calls the resulting decisions a “coup”. When policy Hammond liked was stitched up in secret, that was just politics when policy was made despite his opposition, it was an outrage. When a Leave-supporting chief of staff drafted speeches, it was unacceptable when a “euro-pragmatist” did, it was commendable. It was his duty, he says, to “reinterpret” government policies he disliked.Thankfully, this is all now history, but history that should not be rewritten. The negotiating “red lines” he dismissed as unachievable have been achieved, Britain has left the EU, and Hammond no longer has to serve his constituents as a backbencher, work he said he “hated”. Instead, he is now a peer, and the best possible advertisement for the abolition of the House of Lords.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"clap captain tom photo tribute clap","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕Leer en EspañolCaptain Sir Tom Moore\u0027s memory has been honoured with a national clap.People around the country took part in the tribute to the veteran at 6pm on Wednesday, following his death at the age of 100."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown end key dates schools","story":"NewsWhen will lockdown end  Key dates for schools, shops and pubs as UK passes peakMore than million people have now had their first dose of vaccine in the UK - but Boris Johnson is sticking to March  as the earliest date for easing lockdown.

But thereaposs good news on the horizon, with more than million people now given a first dose of Covid vaccine - and early signs the Oxford jab reduces transmission of the virus by % - and Chris Whitty saying on February  we are apospast the peakapos. Thataposs prompted calls for Boris Johnson to bring forward his plan to ease lockdown, which begins on March  by opening schools. As Scotland announced schools would likely reopen from February , Tory MPs on the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group warned England must have a very good reason not to do the same. But with case rates higher in England than Scotland, and deaths still higher than , a day, the PM is so far sticking firmly to his plan. He says heaposll bring forward a lockdown easing plan in the week of February , with no changes before March . What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Reports - denied as b*****ks by his allies - suggest Chancellor Rishi Sunak is pushing for measures to ease as soon as deaths are down, believing there may soon be a fat lady sings moment when cases stay high but deaths plunge due to vaccine immunity kicking in. But with more easily transmissible mutant strains emerging in the UK, and the nation passing the grim milestone of , deaths, scientic advisors are urging caution. The government has also failed to introduce forced quarantine in hotels for Brits ing from  aposred listapos countries where there are new iants. It was promised at the end of January but may only launch on February .  The vaccine will be key. Even though care home residents have now been offered the jab, Care Minister Helen Whately has suggested normal visits may only resume once most have had their second dose in April. Meanwhile, Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has said itaposll only be after all over-s have got the jab that pressure on the NHS will signicantly reduce. The original plan was to get all over-s their first dose by the end of April.But in a glimmer of hope, privately Whitehall sources believe that could happen quicker. Some murmurings even claim every UK adult could be offered both doses by the end of August. So with all these iables at play, what might the lockdown exit roadmap look like  And how will the next few months go down  Hereaposs everything we know - or can guess - so far. January  Tory ministers claimed they had met their target to offer a first dose of the vaccine to all residents in Englandaposs care homes. However, more than  care homes had not yet been fully reached because they had an active outbreak. There was also confusion about how many staff had had a jab and the government refused to provide firm figures. A minister said staff were still being worked through, only for another minister to claim the staff target had been met. Despite the vaccine breakthrough, normal care home visits are not expected to resume for months. Except for exceptions like deathbed visits, they have to be conducted outdoors or through pods or screens. February  This is the date of the review of the third lockdown in England, as set by the Prime Minister at the start of January. By this date the Government should have a clearer picture of whether the lockdown has worked. Plans will be brought forward the following week. Importantly, this is also the deadline for offering the first dose of a vaccine to all million of the most vulnerable people in the UK.  They are all over-s all elderly care home residents and their carers all shielders and frontline NHS and social care staff. After this, officials will move on to administering first doses to the next priority groups - all over-s and younger “at risk” groups. Separately, around this time the government’s advisors are meant to rule on how priority will work for the final phase of the vaccine rollout - in other words, whether teachers, shop workers and police will get it first. Finally, February  is the rumoured date when hotel quarantine will finally come into force. It was announced three weeks earlier. Brits ing from  aposred listapos countries, where travel for non-Brits is already banned, will have to be in guarded hotels for  days. February   Boris Johnson said the lockdown exit roadmap will be published in the week of February . It will go before Parliament for debate.Reports - downplayed by No - have claimed the roadmap will set out three stages of lting lockdown from March . Mr Johnson and Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty have confirmed lockdown will not be lted all at once - but will instead involve a number of stages. However, the Prime Minister has indicated England will notto the regional apostieredapos system and instead ease out of lockdown all at once - contrary to what he said before. The first actual easing of restrictions isnapost expected until March - despite Scotland potentially opening schools from February . March   This is the earliest date schools could reopen in England, according to Mr Johnson. He said the roadmap will give two weeksapos notice to parents, pupils and school staff. It has been reported some year groups may go back first - most likely primary schools and those in secondaries that have exams this year. Only after this will non-essential shops, pubs and the like start to reopen, but advisers have said we need a clear two-week break between each new thing opening to check itaposs going okay. The reason for the delay from February  is that it takes three weeks for immunity to have some effect. March Schools will be the first to reopen, but quickly other minor aspects of lockdown could be lted - such as the ban on mixing with others from outside your home. We might see a reinstatement of the rule of six, allowing you to meet up with five others, for example. That will set out whether you can meet with people in your garden, in public, in your home or where and how many people at once. March  This is the date the current lockdown legislation for England ends. MPs will have to approve any extension to lockdown rules after this date. By this point, the process of giving first doses to people aged  to  and younger ‘at risk’ groups is meant to be well under way. Officially the target to offer these million people their first dose is the end of April, but sources have claimed it could go quicker. A government source told the Mirror it is possible all million will be offered their first dose by the middle or end of March.  There are a couple of things that could scupper the timetable at this point. Firstly, this is around the time when the NHS has to start giving hundreds of thousands of people per day their second dose. That could gum up capacity and make it harder to get new people through the door for first doses. However, ministers believe the vaccine supply is secure to this point. Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi said on February : “Our limitation is the vaccine supply. It remains stable and good. I can see week by week supply all the way through to the end of March, which is good news.” April  Easter Sunday - and a time when Boris Johnson claimed restrictions would be substantially lted. “I think we can certainly look forward to a very, very dferent world in this country, from Easter onwards,” the PM said. This date is gaining traction because ministers and Chris Whitty have suggested that, after over-s get the jab, itaposll be safe to lt many restrictions. This is around the time many over-sapos immunity should begin kicking in. But the PM has repeatedly over-promised on this in the past. If restrictions aren’t lted in a big way by this point, you could expect a battle between Tory lockdown sceptics and the PM. UK Hospitality has called for pubs to reopen from this weekendcase rates are falling, but others say itaposs far too soon. April According to The , the Governmentaposs roadmap will make sure there is not a sudden increase in community transmission, by staggering what opens when. A Whitehall source told the : If schools do open in March, and the priority is certainly to open schools first, then it will mean other things have to remain closed for some time. “We have to avoid the situation last time where theof schools meant far greater household mixing across the board. “So that means weaposd be likely to wait at least another month for non-essential retail, and a month beyond that at least for pubs and restaurants. That would mean early April is likely when non-essential retail, such as clothes and electronics shops, could reopen, possibly coinciding with Easter.  The Government could also use this Easter break to kickstart tourism, allowing for the reopening of some tourist attractions and possibly accommodation. Travel rules could be eased - within the UK - to allow for staycations. Previously Boris Johnson claimed restrictions would be substantially lted by Easter “I think we can certainly look forward to a very, very dferent world in this country, from Easter onwards,” the PM said. April  This is the latest date by which all over-s and at-risk groups are meant to have been offered their first dose, according to the NHS. m people should have been offered a first vaccine dose by this date. Millions more will be getting their second dose at the same time. After that, the NHS will move onto giving first doses to the final, lowest-priority group - all adults under  without major health issues. These m people will be sorted into priority groups and it’s thought teachers and other key workers will be put first. Meanwhile, care home visits may only properly resume around this date. Care home residents were offered a first dose by the end of January - but it takes  weeks to get a second dose. And care minister Helen Whately said: I know relatives are desperate for normal visiting and I am determined that happen as soon as it is safe, but most care home residents must have their second dose. May Under theplan, early April could be the earliest that pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses would be allowed to reopen. The date could coincide with the May Bank Holiday, usually a big money date for pubs and tourism businesses. SAGE experts have previously said May would be a safer date for reopening the hospitality sector -infection rates can be brought down. If all the over s and most vulnerable have had their first vaccine dose by April, then May would be seen as substantially safe for easing lockdown further. May will also see elections across the country, meaning the Government will want to have eased restrictionspossible to allow this to happen. July Second doses should be rounded off for the middle priority group, the over-s. It’s also one predicted date for all adults to finish being offered their first dose. Officially the target is September for this, but government sources told the Sundayit could be as soon as July. If all adults have had a vaccine by this date, then summer travel becomes more of a possibility. There will still be a aposred listapos of countries requiring quarantine and the Foreign Office will have a list of countries people shouldnapost travel to at all.  Foreign holidays will depend as much on the rules of other countries as of the UK Government - which will be determined by how much of their population has been vaccinated and how safe they view the UK to be. Spain appeared to say it could be closed to tourists throughout the summer season - although it later rolled back on that. July  Rules allowing councils to close pubs, restaurants, shops and parks expire on this date - so it is the current latest date we could see ongoing closures in England. August Tentative reports suggest officials are hopeful that, by the end of August, all adults in the UK will have had both doses of the vaccine. This would allow a major reopening of society.But officially the target is only to offer all adults a first dose by September. Chris Whitty said August is at the very optimistic end. Scientists are hopeful though. SAGE member Andrew Hayward said: I think what weaposll see is a phased opening up as the vaccination levels increase, and then we will be more or less back to normal for the summer, I would imagine. September The Government aims to have offered a first dose of the vaccine to every adult by September. Tory ministers have pledged all UK adults will be offered their first dose by this month. Dominic Raab said the target was by September”, telling Sky News: If we can do it faster than that, great, but thataposs the roadmap. September The start of autumn. Professor Chris Whitty said some coronavirus restrictions could be in place until the autumn while the NHS Chief Executive Sir Simon Stevens said restrictions would be lted between the spring and summer - with summer ending on this date.October The start of flu season, and mass vaccination against that disease. This may be combined with the re-vaccination of the most vulnerable against coronavirus at the end of . Scientists are unsure how long immunity will last from having the jab - with estimates of anything from five to nine months. That means those currently getting the jab will likely need to have another one in October to protect them through next winter. AstraZeneca and Oxford have said vaccine booster shots against new coronavirus iants should be ready by this month. We just have to hope a new iant hasnapost taken hold by that point. December  Even once all UK adults are given a first dose, second doses could go on until Christmas due to a -week gap. That would mean maximum protection would only be given to the maximum size of population about a year from now. Even after this is complete, there are many questions about where the UK’s Covid response goes from here. The vaccine will not eliminate coronavirus completely, and new iants could emerge that challenge how effective it is. That suggests travel restrictions could continue to exist into winter , as well as some of the less invasive restrictions we’ve got used to. Scientic advisors have suggested this could include, for example, wearing masks on public transport.

While Wayne Elliott left behind evidence of his crimes at two dferent flats. Before failing to burgle the first flat, he had ransacked another - leaving an open can of Budweiser with his DNA on it the sink.Newcastle Crown Court heard Elliott, , left the first flat when confronted by the vulnerable homeowner, who uses a walking stick to help with her mobility problems, Chronicle Live reports.It was only after the burglar had escaped through a bedroom window that the victim realised he had stolen nothing but had left the incriminating property behind. Prosecutor Amy Levitt told the court: There was a mobile phone found under the window in the spare bedroom which did not belong to the complainant. There was also a rucksack under the window as well. Upon examination, the phone contained pictures of the defendant and a picture of his own passport, plus messages addressed to Wayne. The victim said she was shocked and dazed when she found the stranger in her home as she had just woken up. Miss Levitt added: She now understands he could have attacked her or worse and thinks about this often. She canapost move fast because of mobility issues and has a walking aid. Elliott pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to steal in relation to the raid in Wallsend on August  last year. He also admitted burglary at a vacant flat in the same area a few days earlier, which was unoccupied at the time. Elliott ransacked every room, stole a microwave and television and left a can of Budweiser in the kitchen sink, which contained his DNA.  Assistant Judge Advocate General Edward Legard sentenced him to  months behind bars. The court heard Elliott, of Wallsend, has previous convictions for  criminal offences. The judge said the victim who lived at the house where the mobile phone was left could not have defended herself and added: She checks doors and windows every night but still finds it dficult to sleep peacefully. The judge told Elliott: You left behind your mobile phone and rucksack. That phone contained pictures of yourself, together with a picture of your passport. Domestic burglaries are rightly viewed in a very serious way indeed. Homeowners are entitled to feel safe and secure in the confines of their homes. In so many cases, such as this, it is vulnerable people who are targeted for this particularly unpleasant crime.

Baffled, the -year-old handed it to her equally puzzled father Wally. The silver key did not fit in any cupboard or door in the house, but it also miraculously disappeared into thin air after being left on the mantlepiece. The strange moment in  was the start of one of the most notorious hauntings of all time as, hours later, the family believe Donald the poltergeist took up residence in their home in Battersea, South London, and stayed for  years. “That night we were woken at am with all this horrendous banging coming from the walls and under the floors and it woke everybody up, including our neighbours” says Shirley, now . “It went on for two or three weeks. The police and the fire brigade were called. The policeman came during the day and noted down what was happening and he said: ‘I think the whole house has had a bit too much cocoa’.”What do you think the truth is  Have your say in the comments section The family – dad Wally, a tube driver, mum Kitty and older brother John – pleaded for the authorities to listen but nothing was done. Soon, Shirley says, Donald became even more menacing: “From there the banging noises started going off during the day too. And the pots and pans that were on the stove and hanging up would fly out and we’d have to dodge them. “At one point, Mum’s clock came off the mantlepiece. It was her pride and joy and it floated across the room and landed on the dining table very gently. “Things were whizzing around and we had to sit there and ride it out.” Now a new Radio  drama-documentary podcast, The Battersea Poltergeist, is reinvestigating the seemingly paranormal events in a bid to finally unlock the -year-old mystery. At the time it made the papers with the press camping outside  Wyclfe Road to try and get a glimpse of what was going on. The Daily Mirror published a story about “Mystery noises that haunt Shirley”. Ghost hunter Harold Chibbett heard about it and offered to help. He visited regularly and asked the poltergeistthey could call him Donald, to which the ghost is said to have delightedly tapped on the table to agree communicating through writing. Shirley shivers: “One day, Mr Chibbett asked Donaldhe could write. He left an ordinary ballpoint pen and paper on the table in the front room and we all came back to the kitchen. He tapped for Donald to write a message. “When we went back, it was really creepy, there was a shaky message and he’d written: ‘I come’. It was months before we got any legible writing. Donald said he couldn’t write with the pen. He wanted a quill.” The family deducted the poltergeist had some intelligence and Shirley says Donald sometimes even played with her. She laughs: “Slippers would walk around the room on their own. They were in front of the fire. They were my dad’s and they would take off and I would chase them up the passage and around the bedroom and try to catch them and he would play with me.” But Shirley says Donald also had a darker side. “We were all treading on eggshells. We had to be careful what we said and didn’t want to upset him because he used to set fire to things. “It started one time when he piled all the tea towels on an electric cooker and it caught fire and Dad had to put it out.  “Another time he set fire to my mum’s double bed and Dad rushed in and he was trying to battle the flames and while he was doing it something pulled him in. “The fire brigade turned up and got Dad away and an ambulance was called because he burned all his arm. “When they got to Battersea General Hospital and cleaned it up they took photographs of it and the consultant said he’d been clawed by a wild animal. “Dad had a terrible arm for about three months because of the burns and he had three claw marks, deep gouges down his arm.” As she got older, Shirley lost friends as the strange happenings continued until . She even lost her job as a seamstress in a London store, when she says Donald stole all the scissors from the workroom. Her grandmother was convinced that Donald was the devil. The family tried to organise an exorcism. Shirley says: “My dad had a co-driver, Mr Hanks. He was a medium and so was his we. He approached my dad and said he could get rid of Donald.  “So we went round to his house one Friday night in Streatham and there was his we and another couple of mediums and a priest and Dad and I. “We all sat in a circle and held hands and Mr Hanks went into a trance and the priest had some holy water.” But the attempt was cut short after the police knocked on the door and accused the party of black magic. The issue was discussed in Parliament and Wally and Mr Hanks gave a statement. Even when Shirley moved to West Sussex after she got married, she says Donald persisted and it wasn’t until she was  that he finally left her alone. She says: “We didn’t have a phone but Donald would leave messages telling me what my parents were doing in London and he’d tell my parents what we were doing in Sussex. He wrote messages and left them around our house.

Bernadette Cooper was last seen alive in January  when she was aged . At the time the mum-of-three was trying to secure loans to save her struggling bar Molly Malones in Spain. Bernadette’s family initially believed she was alive and well and leading a new le following anonymous tip-offs and possible sightings. But Scotland Yard are now investigating the case after she was formally reported as a missing person last year. Her nephew Leon, who is leading the search to find her, fears there is a “sinister explanation” for her disappearance . He said: “Some of my aunts and uncles are still alive and hold out hope but I think in their heart of hearts they know something terrible has happened. “Spain is where I’m getting the most resistance to my questions, for obvious reasons, people are very scared. “If her disappearance was at the hands of others and something terrible has happened to her then our cause will become one of justice to find out the truth and bring anyone involved to justice.” Bernadette and her husband Brian moved to the Costa del Sol in the late s to run a popular bar in Benalmadena, near Malaga. But the breakdown of their marriage saw Brianto England in  seeking a orce. Mum-of-three Bernadette was forced to temporarily close the bar and move to England after falling behind on the rent and spiralling into debt. She approached family members for a £, loan - worth £, in today’s money - but no one was able to help her.  Bernadette, who grew up in Co. Monaghan, Ireland, was last seen alive at The Horse  Groom pub - now renamed - in Tooting, south London. She was in the pub when she called the president of the Irish Bar Owners’ Association in Malaga. She told him: “Do me a favour would you  Tell the lawyer acting for the bar that I have the funds… “Tell him don’t give the bar away – I am on my way back with the money.” A year later one of Bernadette’s sisters flew to Spain to check up on her after she failed to respond to birthday and Christmas cards. She found the bar under new management with no sign of Bernadette. Leon began re-investigating his aunt’s disappearance last March after promising his dying father he would find out what happened to her. Since looking into case he has received threats - meaning he is keeping his age and address secret. Leon believes Bernadette may have been fallen foul of an organised crime gang in the Costa del Sol, known as the “Costa Del Crime” in the s. She told family members she and Brian had been “gassed and robbed” at their Spanish apartment, and the bar was smashed up on another occasion. Leon said: “There is a very strong possibility, although it is only one theory, that people and situations she encountered whilst living and working in Spain may have had a direct bearing on what happened to her. “Obviously we need keys to unlock that theory and it is one of several theories being pursued by British and European police.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first brit 26 catch covid","story":"NewsFirst Brit, , to catch Covid in Wuhan died suddenly a year later at uni hallsConnor Ellis Reed, , became ill with the virus in November  while living abroad but seemingly made a full recovery before ing to Bangor University, Wales to studymirrorShareCommentsByAmelia Shaw:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video first-brit-known-caught-coronavirus-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,: How to claim,articleTypeName:brightcoveVideo,url:https:www.mirror news video pip-personal-independence-payment-how-,articleUrl:,thumbnailUrl:https:cf-images.eu-west-.prod.boltdns.net v static  e-c-a-ca-cfaac e-fe-e-bc-c x match image.jpg,duration:,videoId:,isVideoRelation:,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

He had been working at a school in Wuhan, China and became ill in November  before seemingly making a full recovery.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror.He then left the country to spend time with his family in Australia before moving back to Wales to study Chinese and linguistics at Bangor University. Mr Reed kept a diary while he was in ill in Wuhan, listing his symptoms and sharing his three-and-a-half week ordeal with the world. He described his initial snfle and made notes about the problematic first  days, writing that he believed he was over the worst of the illness on day . But day  brought a relapse - when Mr Reed questioned whether he could be dying. He wrote: Just as I thought the flu was getting better, it has come back with a vengeance. My breathing is laboured. Just getting up and going to the bathroom leaves me panting and exhausted. I’m sweating, burning up, dizzy and shivering.  The television is on but I can’t make sense of it. This is a nightmare. By the afternoon, I feel like I am suffocating. I have never been this ill in my le. I can’t take more than sips of air and, when I breathe out, my lungs sound like a paper bag being crumpled up. This isn’t right. I need to see a doctor. ButI call the emergency services, I’ll have to pay for the ambulance call-out myself. That’s going to cost a fortune. I’m ill, but I don’t think I’m dying - am I  Mr Reed then said he well enough to go back to work after  days of the illness. Acting senior coroner Katie Sutherland told the inquest that the provisional cause of Mr Reedaposs death was given as respiratory failure due to bronchopneumonia caused by combined drug toxicity.

Downing Street have denied – in language some might find strangely specic – reports that two weeks ago Johnson ignored SAGE’s warning that the only way to “get close” to guaranteeing new strains are kept out was completely closing the borders, or introducing hotel quarantine measures for every single person entering the country.  And so, in a week when , people a day are having door-to-door testing in a bid to stamp out the new strain – people with the same new strain can stroll into the UK without any trouble at all. Watch out though - in two weeks time, people with the new strain will be asked to quarantine in hotels, as long as they’ve brought the new strain in from a country we were expecting them to bring it in from. If they’ve brought it from anywhere , happy days. For the new strain.

If you responded, rather than being given a selection of bond options, you were contacted by one company only, Alpha Nova Capital Limited, which is authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority. Mr Beauchamp is the sole director. He gives Companies House a correspondence address in Berkeley Square, central London, plus a date of birth – and this becomes important – of January . An initial background check revealed an elusive inidual with no previous directorships, no social media presence beyond a recent LinkedIn profile and someone who has never owned a house. But there was something about his LinkedIn picture: it bore a marked similarity to a notorious director called Clint Canning.  Canning’s date of birth, according to Companies House records, is also January . In  he was banned from being a director for nine years after his company Quantum Satis Investments Ltd was liquidated owing £.million to another business. The ban applies to “Clint Canning, aka Clint Foster” and an Insolvency Service report gives the reason as “misappropriating monies”, including £, to buy a property in Cyprus, while £, was paid “to companies connected by common directorship or to him directly”. One of the liquidatoraposs reports into Quantum Satis stated: “There are serious issues that required further investigation, predominantly in relation to signicant amount of funds being paid by Mr Clint Canning to himself and or his partner Ms Eleise Wallace, or entities under their control. “Following a detailed analysis of the financial records of the company and extensive dialogue with Mr Canningaposs legal advisors, the liquidators concluded that funds in excess of £k had been taken by Mr Canning without approval of the shareholders and legal justication.” Canning was also a director of FX World Managed Account Limited which was put into compulsory liquidation, the latest liquidatoraposs report showing that unsecured creditors are owed £, and only likely to recover at most p in the pound. This company was on the Financial Conduct Authorityaposs register as the authorised representative of a currency trading firm called ForexMax.When FX World Managed Account went bust it was the subject of an investigation by City of London Police. Despite repeated requests they have been unable to give me an update of the outcome of this investigation. Another company that Canning ran was InvestConnect Limited, was put into compulsory liquidation owing £,. Then there was BaseTrade, which was liquidated owing more than £, and also prompted a City of London Police investigation. Clint Canning is not listed on Companies House records as a director but there is Clint Foster, with a date of birth of January . After seeing Mr Beauchamp’s resemblance to Canning and their coincidental dates of birth, and knowing that Canning has form for using an alias, I asked him a blunt question: was he really Clint Canning  In a brief email Mr Beauchamp told me this was “incorrect”, adding that he wanted a remote meeting to discuss the matter in more detail. “One partner is in Moscow and the other is in Monaco,” he emailed. “They have askedyou could accept a Zoom call tomorrow at .am. “I can assure you that once you speak to them, this will satisfy your enquiry.” The following morning Mr Beauchamp emailed to say: “Apologies, I need to push back by  min. Sorry for any inconvenience. I will amend the invitation.” It was all a ruse, he had no intention of having a remote meeting – he was in his car en route to my house, turning up unannounced and saying he had employed a private detective to find my address. I should state that he was civil, and the fact that I took the unspoken subtext of the visit to be “I know where you live” might be my fault and not his. He produced a passport and driving licence in the name Christian Beauchamp, and these gave his full date of birth –  January, . The reason that he gave for this being the same date of birth shown on Clint Canning’s director disqualication order was remarkable. Clint, he said, was his brother and for some reason had used Christian’s date of birth for business purposes. According to Mr Beauchamp, Clint is four years younger, being born in August , and adopted the surname of her mother’s new husband after she re-married. He insisted that Alpha Nova Capital was entirely unconnected to Canning and was trying to raise million – which sounds ambitious for a company so new it has not yet filed any accounts. The money, he said, would not come from ordinary savers, so-called retail investors. “It’s an institutional hedge fund, we only deal with institutions and pension funds,” he maintained. “We do not detail with retail at all, we don’t touch it, weaposre not licensed to do it.” So why was topbonds.net trying to reel-in retail investors for Alpha Nova Capital He said this came about because he was approached by marketing company NXT Generation to discuss recruiting sophisticated investors, the minimum investment being million. NXT Generation subcontracted the job to another company, Lynx World of Chelmsford, Essex, which produced the misleading topbonds.net site. “I had no idea what topbonds.net was until I saw it,” Mr Beauchamp told me. “I said I do not want anything to do with it, remove my name from it and refund my money. “I told them ‘I cannot believe you’ve associated me with this’.” Jonathan Pach of NXT Generation confirmed that they passed on the campaign to Lynx World, which then set up topbonds.net ANC “without approval from NXT Generation or Alpha Nova Capital.” He added that there had been only a handful of responses from the public. Lynx World as not responded to me.Another company that has not got back to me is Alpha Ethical Investment Limited, run by -year-old Zack Chasmine.This is the firm that is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and has appointed Alpha Nova Capital as an authorised representative, allowing Alpha Nova to claim that it is “Authorised and Regulated by the FCA”. Alpha Ethical Investments claims to offer “socially responsible” investing that can “outperform”, but the latest filed accounts are in the “micro” form and show just one employee and capital and reserves of only £,. Mr Beauchampaposs LinkedIn profile shows has worked for established names in the investment world, including being a portfolio manager at Coronation Fund Managers. But Coronation said that it had never heard of him. Mr Beauchamp insisted that he had worked there, though only as a consultant, and that his LinkedIn profile wrongly stating that he had been an employee was put together by his personal assistant without him checking it. “Who gets their PA to set up a profile and never checks it ” asked my source at Coronation. That profile also claimed that Mr Beauchamp had been an equities trader at Goldman Sachs, but they too had not heard of him. The claim of working at the banking giant also appeared on an Alpha Nova Capital brochure sent to a prospective investor, which says that he joined Goldman Sachs “as an Equity Trader managing a portfolio of over BN.” I’ve also seen an email that was sent by Alpha Nova Capital to a possible investor claiming that Mr Beauchamp “has  years’ experience as an equities trader at Goldman Sachs.” This email was sent to someone responding to the topbonds.net  ANC site, the one that Mr Beauchamp says heaposs disowned. Instead of telling the investor that the marketing campaign was an an error and it does not deal with small investors, the email dangled the prospect of % s. It went on to explain that after “huge interest” it has “opened their door to Institutions, Family Offices, and UHNW HNW investors.” How many average savers would know that those initials stand for Ultra High Net Worth and High Net Worth   That email was written by Ryan Lynn, “Head of Wealth Management  Investor Relations” at Alpha Nova Capital. His LinkedIn account states that he has also works at Colossus Financial dealing with investors. Ryan Lynn, with the prefix “Lord”, is the director of Colossus Financial Limited. Why,it is actively dealing with investors, do the only accounts it has submitted to Companies House list it as dormant  “Lord” Ryan Lynn, , didn’t answer, nor tell me why his LinkedIn page does not mention what seems to be an unusual appointment for an investment professional. He was the director of Platinum Moments Limited until it was dissolved, this company being “the go-to Premier Hire Photo Booth  Magic Mirror Company” for London and Essex. I suggested to Mr Beauchamp that there was one sure way to prove that he and Clint Canning were dferent people – obtaining copies of their birth certicates. So I asked him for their mother’s full name and maiden name. “I simply do not know!” he replied. “Our upbringing was dferent than the norm, born out of wedlock in ’s ’s Catholic Ireland. “Are you not familiar with mother and baby homes scandal ” Maybe, instead, he could provide some pictures of him and Clint together, or give details of his real past employers rather than the ones on his LinkedIn profile, but he stopped replying.I did find a Facebook page of a woman with the surname Foster – this being an alias that Clint Canning once used - that included a picture of three grown-up children, including Clint, or possibly Christian.A Facebook friend of Mrs Foster asked her how the children were getting along. She replied that Clint was  and a successful businessman, and then she mentions the two daughters. There was no mention of a son called Christian. This exchange took place in June . If Clint, as Mr Beauchamp claims, was born in , then he would have been  at the time, not . Perhaps his mother got confused about the age of her own son. I asked Mr Beauchamphe could explain this but got no answer, and the Facebook pictures have now been deleted. I do hope that Companies House and the Financial Conduct Authority carried out a thorough identity check before letting him become a director of an authorised company.

Samantha, who changed her surname from Grant to Markle, hasnapost seen Meghan for years and wasnapost invited to her royal wedding to Prince Harry in . However, this week she released a -page book on Meghan - The Diary of Princess Pushyaposs Sister: A Memoir, Part One - defending herself and their father, Thomas Markle and saying the truth is stranger than fiction. The book contains chapters titled Markle Beginnings, When Grandma Said the N Word, The Queen Would be Appalled and Looking For Mr Right The Wrong Way. Among the things she discusses in the book is her decision to help their dad, Thomas, set up staged paparazzi photos in the lead up to the royal wedding. She explains that they agreed as they wanted to show him in a true light as other members of the press had been so disparaging, intentionally. She also claims she got no money for the deal.According to extracts of the book seen by Newsweek, she writes: It was just allowing the Royals and the world to see him in his proper light, because he was so horribly labeled and photographed. It was like watching vultures feast. The photographer said, aposDonapost worry, I will take good care of your dad, and nobody will even see.apos She claims that she chocked when she saw their plan had been rumbled, saying they felt they had been baited. Samantha first announced her book several years ago, but itaposs only just been released. There were reports that Meghan burst into tears when she heard about her sisteraposs plans.in  the Daily Mail reported Meghan had told friends that she stopped reading interviews with members of her family after finding out about the first book two years ago and tries not to look at gossip about herself.The friend is quoted as saying: She cried when she found out about it. Out of everything thataposs been said, the one thing that really upset her was that [the book]. She and Samantha never had a very good relationship and she feels her sister is using her position for profit. The back cover reads: Things are not always as they seem, in a world where social labels and perceptions often define who we are, how we live, and how we view each other. With a B.A. in sociology, and an M.A. in counseling, Samantha never thought she would find herself caught in between the cross hairs of media mayhem, as she defends herself, and her father, by dispelling social labels, and fake news, when her sister marries a Duke, and a Royal fairy plummets from the tea towels.

Eboney Cheshire died on Monday, December  after she went to bed on the Saturday at her home in St Helens and sadly never woke up.The thirteen-year-oldaposs mum Kerry Williams found the teenager in bed having a powerful seizure, Liverpool Echo reported.The devastated mum is adamant her daughter didnapost knowingly take ecstasy, and is sure somebody  spiked a bottle of Lucozade Eboney had been drinking hours before she died. Kerry said: It doesnapost matter how good a parent you are, you never always know what your children are doing. But I canapost get my head round why Eboney would take something like ecstasy, knowing how poorly she was. Andsheaposd knowingly taken a pill, she would not have been sat on the sofa waiting for me to get in, she wouldnapost have wanted to face me. I think sheaposs seen someone she knew on the walk back home, and they have taken the bottle and put something in it. It makes me feel sick, all these people claiming to be her friend, but people know information and this has been done by someone she knew. Two years on from Eboneyaposs death how the drug, also known as MDMA, got into her system remains a mystery. Detectives investigating the tragedy have drawn a blank, although tests seem to show the tablet was placed into the soft drink which Eboney bought on the Saturday evening.  In the run up to her death the pupil had been suffering with suspected tonsillitis bad enough for her to be kept off school on Friday, November  . She was croaky, struggling to speak and bunged up. On the Saturday, the teen and her mum spent much of the day on the sofa watching Christmas films, including The Grinch, and on Sunday, Kerry ed home from work at .pm and saw her daughter. Eboney was sitting on the sofa, having ed  minutes earlier from a shop where she had bought noodles, Monster Munch crisps and Lucozade. After a brief conversation with her mum, she went upstairs to bed where later she suddenly fell ill, and entered a deadly seizure. The -year-old was rushed to Whiston Hospital, but despite the best efforts of medics, she died at around am on December .  Unravelling what happened in the  minutes between her leaving the shop - when she was seen on CCTV - and arriving home could prove crucial to the case. It usually takes just five minutes to complete that short walk. Mum Kerry thinks her daughter encountered someone familiar on that journey who secretly placed the ecstasy in her Lucozade, which she then drank unknowingly. Kerry, , has spoken of her frustration that the Lucozade bottle was only very recently examined for fingerprints, which produced unconfirmed results. No arrests have ever been made for drugs supply, and the investigation has been closed, although it can be reopenednew information comes to light.  Last week, a coroner at Bootle Coroneraposs Court recorded a conclusion of drug-related death at Eboneyaposs inquest, causing both her mum and granddad Peter to voice their objections in court. And they also told proceedings they were unhappy the investigation has been stopped and that nobody had ever been criminally questioned over the tragedy. In response, detective inspector Leanne Hobin, of Merseyside Police, said: “Working closely with the Coroner’s Office, a full and thorough investigation was carried out into the circumstances surrounding Eboney’s death. Despite pursuing every available line of enquiry, unfortunately, no arrests or charges were made in connection with the supply of drugs which took Eboney’s le. “The death of Eboney was absolutely tragic, and I can only begin to imagine how dficult the past two years have been for her family. I offer them my sincere and continued condolences. We will continue to support them in any way we can going forward. Mum Kerry also appealed directly to people in the Rainhill community, and her daughteraposs friends to help clear up the mystery. She said: If anyone spoke to Eboney on December , even it reveals the tinniest bit of information, please get in touch. Itaposs hard not to blame yourself, as a mum, I look at myself as a role model and think could I have been better  What keeps me going is that I have a son, nearly , and his welfare. Ultimately, you donapost know what your kids get up to, but Eboney wouldnapost have experimented with drugs, or experimented. Of course, she wasnapost an angel, but she never brought trouble to the house, she was a good, loving child. Iaposve said from the outset, her death was suspicious. The circumstances donapost match up what happened to her. Toxicology reports revealed an extremely high level of MDMA, or ecstasy, in a level lying above the range of which fatalities have been reported.  Eboney, who had talked of wanting to become a doctor, was a really funny, hysterical girl who was so confident. Kerry added: She would make you laugh all the time with her facial expressions, she was very animated, very quick and witty.

Katie Corrigan - who had been desperate to become a nurse - suffered with anxiety and depression and her family claimed at her inquest that she was overprescribed the painkilling drug. The coroner was also told that Katie, who was  when she died last August, suffered a traumatic event when she was working at the West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance when she was the victim of a serious sexual assault as she walked to her car. Her mother Christine Taylor told the Truro inquest that her daughter did not tell us or her husband at the time about the sex assault and it just festered. But her mother said Katie suffered post tramautic stress syndromeas a result of the assault, Cornwall Live reports. The inquest was told Katie went on to forge prescriptions for herself and she was then arrested and ended in court where she was given a suspended jail term and was struck off. Her mother said: She obviously lost her nursing registration and was devastated by this, her whole career she had worked really hard for. On Christmas Eve  her husband revealed he was having an affair and he left her and their two children. Mrs Taylor said Katieaposs husband Steven told police about the forged prescriptions and claimed he was controlling during their orce and about giving her access to their children. She said Katie was admitted to hospital in  with liver issues and had paracetemol in her system but in November  she took Codeine she managed to buy over the internet and was very unwell after that. Her husband refused access to the children during the Covid lockdown because Mrs Taylor was nursing and Katie did not see the children for five weeks, the inquest was told. Specialist nurse Mrs Taylor said: In lockdown she was devastated. She tried her best to keep herself going but her mood was very low. She was devastated her husbandaposs partner had more control over her children than she was allowed. Her family claim Katie was overprescribed Codeine by her GP surgery and that there were no investigations into her neck pain. A post mortem said she died from a codeine overdose at her home in St Erth, Cornwall. In a tribute to their daughter after the inquest, Katieaposs parents, Fred and Christine Taylor, said: Katie was a lovely person kind, caring, loving and loyal. She had a wicked sense of humour and a smile that lit up the room. She was very much loved by her family, friends and work colleagues and absolutely adored by her two beautul children. Katie experienced many traumatic events in her le, more than anyone should have to endure, which resulted in her battling and suffering with anxiety and depression. She engaged with the mental health services, she desperately wanted help, but unfortunately these were ineffective for Katie for ious reasons - one being unable to access face-to-face consultations due to lockdown. Katie trained as a nurse, a career that she loved and one that she hoped to be in for le, but this was not to be. She was an integral part of our family, a wonderful daughter, sister and auntie and above all an excellent and loving mother. Katie is very much loved and will be missed every day by her family and friends. Her children are her lasting legacy and will be a constant reminder to everyone who knew and loved her.”  The inquest heard how Katie suffered from anxiety and depression.Speaking at the hearing, Mrs Taylor, who is a specialist nurse in  Cornwall, said her daughter was a lovely person but struggled with her mental health and previously suffered miscarriages.She said: She had suffered with depression and anxiety for some time and at some stage she developed a dependence on Codeine. She said her daughter had neck problems and was prescribed tablets to help deal with the pain. She said: She was in a controlling marriage, she had two children to look after, two jobs to sort out and I think her depression worsened. Referencing the serious sexual assault when she was working as a nurse at West Cornwall Hospital, Mrs Taylor said: She had a traumatic event when she was leaving West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance. Somebody followed her to the car and seriously sexually assaulted her. This resulted in post traumatic stress disorder , she didnapost tell us, or her husband at the time, and it just festered basically. Katie then got a job as a practice nurse in Penzance, which she was absolutely thrilled about, but it was hard for her and completely dferent to what she was used to. This was at The Morrab Surgery, where she used her mentor’s username and password to forge prescriptions. It came to light that she was trying to haul a number of pills and as a result she was struck off by the Nursing and Midwery Council.In October , Katie appeared at  Truro Crown Court  and was found guilty of two counts of fraud and one county of forgery. She received a -month custodial sentence, suspended for  months. Mrs Taylor said: She was devastated by this. Her whole career, all the work she worked really hard for, then her husband was basically training to be in the fire service and met someone . He told Katie he was having an affair on Christmas Eveand she had to pretend everything was fine for the children on Christmas Day. When the lockdown started, her husband refused access to the children for five weeks, because Mrs Taylor was still working as a nurse and was unable to supervise visits. Katie was found dead at her home in St Erth on August , , with potentially fatal levels of [the drug] in her system.Detective Constable Neil Goddard, of  Devon and Cornwall Police, said: Having met Christine and Fred on several occasions and spending some time with them trying to get a picture of Katie, itaposs evident they loved and supported her through dficult periods of her le and unfortunately Katie had a history of issues with prescription medication.He said Katie was looking forward to a new chapter in her le and had made plans to complete a second year of university and had put a deposit on her own house at the time of her death. She was going to use the money from her part of the house sale to clear her debts and had made a will leaving her money in trust to her children. DC Goddard added: In the past Katie, it would appear, had considered suicide, from the notes found in her diary. If she had meant to kill herself I would have expected to find a current suicide note and to find her in bed having taken an overdose. He said he felt her death was accidental and not a deliberate act. During the inquest it was revealed by Katieaposs GP, Tamara Curnow, that Katie found a loophole in the surgery’s system which meant she was over-prescribed Codeine. Katie was able to request repeat prescriptions early.

Professor Christopher Gosden said his loving mum Dr Jean Weddell, a medical doctor, had vowed in  to leave him her Edwardian London home. But instead the director of the Institute of Archaeology at Oxford University was left with nothing when she died in . That was after she fell in love with Wendy Cook, a barrister  years her junior, with whom Dr Weddell formed a civil partnership in , at the age of . By the time she died in , she had made a new will, handing nothing to her son but leaving much of her estate to her new partner. The professor later discovered that his mumaposs home - now worth £.m - had been sold without his knowledge in  and that by the time she died three years later, there was just £, left in her estate. Professor Gosden launched a court fight, claiming that a trust scheme his mum set up in  to minimise inheritance tax ought to have given him and his fellow-professor we Jane Kaye the right to veto the sale of the house. He said he would never have let the house be sold, given that Ms Cook - whom he regarded with distrust - would be the ultimate beneficiary of the proceeds of sale after his mumaposs death, following the new will earlier that year. The couple sued the firm of solicitors responsible for drawing up the trust agreement, Halliwell Landau, claiming they bungled by leaving a loophole which allowed the house in Kennington, London to be sold without their knowledge. They were negligent in failing to register a restriction on the house with the Land Registry, which would have kept Prof Gosden and his we in control of whether or not it was sold, he argued. Last January, after battling all the way up to the Court of Appeal, the couple won a ruling that the negligence of the solicitors firm had led to them taking a financial hit. Today Judge Mark Pelling QC, sitting at the High Court, ruled that the firm must pay the academic £,. in damages for their blunder.  Dr Weddell, who died in  aged , regarded her son with affection and generosity and had left him and his we her whole estate by a will she made in , said the judge. At the same time, she set up an estate protection scheme, putting her house into a trust which promised to deliver the property, or the money from its sale, into the hands of her son and his family in a tax efficient manner. Professor Gosden and Professor Kaye were appointed trustees of the scheme, along with Ms Weddell. But in February , she made the new will, leaving much of her wealth to Wendy Cook. Later that year, the house was sold for £,.  Lord Justice Patten in the appeal hearing said Prof Gosden made it clear that the house had been a much-loved family home which his mum was anxious to pass on to her family. He said he believed it was Ms Cook, rather than his mother, who chose to sell the property and many of his answers indicate a deep distrust of Ms Cook and her motives.Dr Weddell had gone to live with Ms Cook on the Isle of Wight, there had been the signicant diminution of contact between Prof Gosden and his mother...and a corresponding concern on the part of Prof Gosden and Prof Kaye about Dr Weddellaposs capacity and what they regarded as the malign influence of Ms Cook in the arrangement of Dr Weddellaposs affairs, he added.

Veronique Morel, , unleashed a drunken tirade of abuse when air stewards were forced to wake her after the Qatar Airways flight had touched down in Edinburgh in August .Morel, who was working as a seismic acquisition analyst with ION Geophysical at the time, shouted the obscenity at air staff before issuing the threat to kill one of the employees, the Daily Record reports.The unruly off-shore worker also emptied her handbag onto the floor before struggling with police officers who had been called in to deal with the passenger. After being asked to produce her passport, Morel told them to f*** off and raised her middle finger at the officers. Morel, from Marchmont, Edinburgh, then attempted to break free from the officers and wedged her legs against the door of the police vehicle before being taken to Livingston police station. A court heard Morel later became apologetic and tearful as she sobered up at the station and claimed she could not remember the flight as she had mixed alcohol with medication. She told officers she had not drunk alcohol for four weeks as she had been working off-shore and had downed drinks at the airport in Doha before getting on the plane. The oil and gas executive represented herself when she pleaded guilty to three offences at Edinburgh Sherf Court in December and was back in the dock for sentencing yesterday. Morel admitted to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by acting in an aggressive manner, shouting, swearing and uttering threats of violence towards a member of cabin crew while on board an aircraft at Edinburgh Airport on August , . She also admitted to being drunk on board the Qatar Airways flight between Hamad International Airport, Doha and Edinburgh Airport and resisting arrest.

The sheet was discovered by Rosa Beckerton’s husband Peter, , while he was refurbishing an old piece of furniture for a client. It is dated February , , and appears to be written by an -year-old girl imagining the state of the world in . She correctly predicts a huge sht in technology and even forecasts the Zoom revolution. Describing her husband’shome from work she writes: “’Hello dear,’ he said to me. ‘I’ve just got to ring up my friend on the telephone’.What do you think about the schoolgirlaposs predictions  Let us know in the comments“’Well you’d better tidy yourself up a bit,’ I said. “In  the telephone was a square box thing with a resiver [sic] on top of it. “But now it is still a resiver [sic], but you can see the people you are talking to, for there is a screen where you can see the people. It is a bit like a television.” Upholsterer Peter found the note stuffed down the back of a sofa which was sent to him for restoration after being bought second-hand.  Rosa, , from Peterborough, Cambs., decided to make the it public in case the author, who would now be aged around , is still alive. She said: “When my husband showed it to me I couldn’t believe it. I thought oh my god, look at this. “It was just so interesting, because looking at it today she’s got a lot of her predictions kind of right - but in her childish innocent way she thought it would all happen in ten years.  “I just wanted to share it in the hopes that maybe the author might see it and recognise it. “My husband has found all sorts of rubbish down the side of sofas and furniture before - but never anything as interesting as this.” The letter is unnamed but comes complete with a teacher’s corrections and comments in red pen - including the verdict ‘Good’.  It begins: “The year is , the time is half-past moon dust. Here I am twenty-one years of age, sitting in a cushion of air. “I remember when I was  years old and I was at school, things have changed since then. “For instance, the television has changed. “In  it was a square box with knobs in front of it. Now it is a big screen with knobs on your chair arm to switch it on and off.” The schoolgirl imagines that she is a married bank worker. She says in times past she would have “prepared tea” ready for her husband to come home. But she adds: “All we have is a piece of chewing gum to eat. You may think that we have not enough to eat but you are wrong, because this piece of chewing gum is food.

The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine was still effective after  days without a top up dose in the recommended time frame, researchers at the University of East Angliasaid. The Government faced criticism over its decision to delay the timing of the second dose of Covid- vaccines until  weeks after the first, with some raising concerns over the level of immunity from a single injection.UEAaposs study comes after a study by the University of Oxford found its coronavirus vaccine with AstraZeneca offers protection of  per cent up to  weeks after a single dose and may reduce transmission by  per cent.The UEA study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, looked at data from Israel where the vaccine has been rolled out.Have you had your vaccine  Let us know in the comments belowScientists found the vaccine becomes  per cent effective after  days - supporting UK plans to delay the timing of a second jab. While it is not yet known how long immunity lasted beyond  days without a second dose, researchers believe it is unlikely to majorly decline during the following nine weeks. But scientists warned peopleaposs risk of infection doubled in the first eight days after the Pfizer vaccine jab, citing people becoming less cautious as a possible cause. Lead researcher Professor Paul Hunter, from UEAaposs Norwich Medical School, said: A recent non peer-reviewed pre-print paper based on Israelaposs experience looked at data from , people who had been given the Pfizer vaccine. It reported that a single dose may not provide adequate protection.  But we saw a number of flaws in how they looked at the data including the fact that they did not attempt to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine from day  onwards. This would have given a better indication of how effective a single dose of the vaccine could bethe second dose was delayed by up to  weeks. Researchers analysed data to see the impact of the Israeli vaccination programme on case numbers, and went on to estimate vaccine effectiveness over time.  They found that after the initial vaccination case numbers increased for eight days before declining to low levels by day . Prof Hunter said: Surprisingly, the daily incidence of cases increased strongly after vaccination till about day eight - approximately doubling. We donapost know why there was this initial surge in infection risk but it may be related to people being less cautious about maintaining protective behaviours as soon as they have the injection. We found that the vaccine effectiveness was still pretty much zero until about  days after people were vaccinated. But then after day  immunity rose gradually day by day to about  per cent at day  and then didnapost improve any further. All the observed improvement was before any second injection.  This shows that a single dose of vaccine is highly protective, although it can take up to  days to achieve this. And it supports the UK policy of extending the gap between doses by showing that a single dose can give a high level of protection.

Birminghamaposs director of public health, Dr Justin Varney said it is important any cases are quickly isolated, but said it wonapost be the only wave of the mutated strain. The Government has set up aposOperation Eagleapos, part of the national track and trace programme, in a bid to stamp out new iants of concern - with people in affected postcodes advised to get tested.That includes Frankley Great Park and parts of Northfield, where two cases have been identied, and are overseen by Dr Varneyaposs department, reports BirminghamLive.Have you had your vaccine  Let us know in the comments belowThis will happen again, said the doctor during a video interview. As we go through the next year we will have this saturation testing whenever we find these iants cropping up. It is really important we seethese cases are isolated - but there is no cause for panic. We simply ask people to not take risks. We are being over cautious to an extent. Please follow the rules. It does not mean lock yourself away, it is not about scaring people, it is about being careful.  Dr Varney went on to say the South African iant is among the mutations that are either most infectious, more deadly or more resistant to the vaccines. Other identied iants include those in Brazil, Japan and the UK - the so-called Kent iant. Several cases of the South Africa iant have been identied linked to travel, with those affected picking it up abroad but now in quarantine.  Dr Varney said the concern comes in when patients are identied who have not contracted it abroad, but from within their community. Downing Street launched door-to-door testing in parts of the country after  such cases were identied earlier this week. Dferent iants are recognised through geno-typing positive tests, looking at genetic history of the sample, which can take four weeks to complete.  Dr Varney said all over s who are living or working in areas identied by the Government are strongly encouraged to take a PCR Covid- test this week through one of the designated sites in their area, eventhey are not showing symptoms. Children are not being tested because it is deemed unnecessary, with the likelihood that any identied positive cases in adults in a household will likely mean the children are infected anyway, he added. The tests must be done at designated sites or using test kits provided as every swab will be geno typed and the result ed in  hours as part of the mass testing process.  Asked why lockdown restrictions havenapost been made any tighter, Dr Varney said: There is no need to close anything additional. Only those who cannot work from home should be in a workplace setting anyway, and employers should be ensuring premises are covid-safe, he said.

The trial - said to be the worldaposs first - will investigate the immune responses of an initial jab of the Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZenecaaposs, as well as vice versa, with intervals of  and  weeks.Researchers said data on vaccinating people with the two dferent types of coronavirus vaccines could help understand whether jabs could be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world.Recruitment for the study began today, with more than  participants expected to take part, researchers said, across eight dferent sites across England, including London, Birmingham and Liverpool. Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said initial results could inform vaccine deployment in the second half of the year. He said: We will get some results through, we expect, by June or thereabouts that will inform the use of booster doses in the general population. Minister for Covid- Vaccine Deployment, Nadhim Zahawi, said: This is a hugely important clinical trial that will provide us with more vital evidence on the safety of these vaccines when used in dferent ways. Nothing will be approved for use more widely than the study, or as part of our vaccine deployment programme, until researchers and the regulator are absolutely confident the approach is safe and effective. Scientists are looking to recruit people over the age of  who may be at higher risk than younger people and have not been vaccinated already. The Government-backed study, which has received £ million in funding from the Vaccine Taskforce, aims to establish whether a mixed-dose vaccine regimen is better than, or a good alternative to, using two doses of the same Covid- jab.

After a car accident, Joe DiMeo, who was left disfigured, received the transplant in August at NYU Langone Health Centre in New York after undergoing a gruelling -hour operation. The surgery was conducted by  doctors and was carried out between two operating theatres. More than  other health care professionals also took part. Today, when the Mirror spoke to Joe he offered a message of support over what hope his historic operation should give to people in the UK and rest of the world who are where he once was. There is always light at the end of the tunnel. Never give up, he said. And appearing on Good Morning America today, he said: “When I saw my face for the first time, it didn’t hit me. It didn’t seem real at first. “The swelling comes down every day. I see my cheekbones now.” DiMeo said he wanted to one day meet his donor’s family. “I’m grateful for them to give this gt to me. I don’t know how to thank someone that gives you a second chance at le,” he added. The -year-old fell asleep at the wheel of his car after working a night sht in . The vehicle blew up, and he was pulled from the wreckage. The explosion left DiMeo with third-degree burns over  per cent of his body. He spent the next four months in a New Jersey hospital’s burn unit, including more than two months in a medically induced coma. His body was so severely burned his fingertips were amputated, and he lost his lips, ears and eyelids. “The therapist actually told me what happened to my body, and I was pretty bummed out at first,” DiMeo said.  “But you know, that was my le at that point, so I had to push through it.” No longer able to live independently on his release from hospital, DiMeo moved in with his parents, John and Rose DiMeo, who became their son’s carers. They spoke of his determination to rebuild his le. “He’s been that way the whole way through, just, ‘What’s next  What do we do next ’” said, John.  “He just kept knocking down the goals... still doing it.” As part of his recovery, DiMeo underwent  reconstructive surgeries. He then reached the point where his plastic surgeon told him there was nothing more he could do to help him regain ality. DiMeo was then connected to one of the world-leading experts Dr Eduardo Rodriguez, at NYU Langone Health.  “A lot of his body was severely burned, andit wasn’t burned, it was scarred from removing skin to cover those burns with skin grafts,” Dr Rodriguez told Good Morning America. “So physically, he was severely compromised, but his spirit was very strong and with great hope to not want to live this way for the rest of his le.” Due to his age, good health, the severity of his burns, and determination, DiMeo was considered an ideal candidate for both a face and a double hand transplant. “I never heard of such a thing before that,” DiMeo said of the transplant.  “But I said, ‘Let’s do it then. If they’re offering it, it must be working out.’” “I was pretty excited. I wasn’t really scared or nervous, I just wanted to get through it.” In August, doctors found a match for him - an unidentied donor in Delaware - who DiMeo had just a six per cent chance of being compatible with because of all of the surgeries he’d already undergone. He has so far not experienced any rejection to the transplant.  “They said that I’m ahead of schedule because, right now, I have  pounds of grip strength, and usually people don’t get that in five months,” he said. “Even on my days off of therapy, I still go downstairs and work out.” DiMeo has also contacted the family of his donor, whom he now has the face and hands of but does not know any details about. “I sent them a letter, but I know they just had someone passed away, so I’m not trying to rush them or anything,” he said.  “I’m very grateful for them to give this gt to me, and I don’t really know how to thank someone that, you know, gives you a second chance at le. I’m very thankful for it.” DiMeo goal is to live on his own again within the next two years, and then have a family, a career and a “normal” and “simple” le. He said he thinks the full impact of his face transplant will hit him when he fulfils another goal, driving on his own again. “It’s pretty interesting to see someone’s face on me, but I guess it didn’t hit me yet,” he said.  “I think it’ll really hit me when I’m driving by myself and, like, I look in the rearview mirror and see myself, by myself, you know, alone.” “I think that’s when it’ll hit me, because driving is my goal, long-term goal, now,” DiMeo said. “It’s peaceful for me.” According to the United Network for Organ Sharing, worldwide, surgeons have completed at least  face transplants and  hand transplants.

The woman, in her thirties, had contacted her housemate about plans to use the dining table while working from home months ago.

She had already shipped her belongings abroad and was in the airport when she was pulled aside by the authorities - and told she wasnapost allowed to leave because of a police case against her.

The photograph shows what initially appears to be an unremarkable outdoor swimming pool with nobody inside the water. Except a circled area of the poolreveals that a child is in fact beneath the water but practically invisible to the naked eye. The child was captured wearing pale blue shorts swimming near the bottom of the swimming pool but because of the colour he would prove dficult to see by anyone observing.Australian Facebook group CPR Kids, run by expert paediatric nurses, shared the image in a bid to warn parents to make sure their children wear visible and brightly coloured clothing while in the water.  On Facebook the group said: Yes, there is a child there, itaposs hard to believe we know. Following on from out post recently on the importance of fluoroand bright coloured swimwear for kids, one of the CPR Kids Educators was at a pool party with friends and noticed how cloudy the water had become after being used all day. She asked one of the children who was wearing a pale blue swimsuit, to swim to the bottom. The result shocked her, as it did everyone in the CPR Kids team. The original Facebook post has attracted hundreds of comments from those who were shocked by the stark image, and it has since been widely shared since it was put online.  ridiculously beautul photos from the Travel Photographer of the Year awards"},{"url":null,"title":"german sniffer dogs are able","story":"NewsGerman snfer dogs are able to detect Covid with  per cent accuracyThe dogs are conditioned to snf out the \"corona odour\" that comes from cells in infected people, said a vet at Germanys armed forces school for service dogsmirrorShareCommentsByWilliam Walker:,  FEB NewsResearchers at Hanover universitys vet clinic present -year-old Belgian shepherd Filou \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Holger Volk, head of the veterinary clinic said: We did a study where we had dogs snfing samples from Covid-positive patients and we can say that they have a  per cent probability in our study ... that they can snf them out. So dogs can really snf out people with infections and without infections, as well as asymptomatic and symptomatic Covid patients. Filou, a -year-old Belgian Shepherd, and Joe Cocker, a -year-old Cocker Spaniel, are two of the dogs being trained at Hanoveraposs University of Veterinary Medicine. Stephan Weil, premier of Lower Saxony, the state of which Hanover is the capital, said he was impressed with the study and called for a feasibility tests before the snfer dogs are put to use in everyday le, such as on people attending concerts. He added: We now need tests in selected events. In Finland, dogs trained to detect the novel coronavirus began snfing passenger samples at Finlandaposs Helsinki-Vantaa airport last September, in a pilot project alongside more usual testing at the airport.

Isabelle Eleanore was wearing a black crop top and blue jeans when the cabin crew member stopped her while boarding and said the outfit was inappropriate for flying. The Instagram and Only Fans model said the Jetstar flight attendant suggested she wear a jumper to cover her upper body, adding: You canapost wear a bikini. Isabelle was handed a hi-vis vest to wear over the crop top and felt embarrassed and degraded as she wore it while walking down the aisle in front of other passengers. Have you had a similar experience recently  Email your story to webnews@mirror. She said her outfit wasnapost inappropriate or revealing, and believes she would have been treated dferentlyshe had smaller breasts or was a man. Low-cost airline Jetstar has since apologised and said there was a misunderstanding of the airlineaposs policy on the part of the flight attendant. Isabelle said the incident happened as she boarded a flight from Gold Coast to Melbourne in Australia on Monday night. She told News: She looked at the ticket and then looked up and said, aposOh, do you have a jumper you can wear apos and then hereaposs me thinking she must be concerned Iaposm going to get cold on the flight, itaposs going to be cold in Melbourne or something.She kept going and she was like, aposWell, you canapost fly with what youaposre wearing, you canapost wear a bikiniapos. And Iaposm like, aposLook - itaposs not a bikini, itaposs a topapos. Isabelle, who was travelling with her husband, Jeremy Szwarcbord, said the flight attendant called over the rest of the crew to look for something she could wear over the crop top. The couple didnapost have a jumper or another top in their hand luggage as they boarded the two-hour domestic flight. The flight attendant then ed with a hi-vis vest for Isabelle to wear until she disembarked in Melbourne. She then had to walk down the aisle to her seat as other passengers looked on. Isabelle said she felt victimised, degraded and embarrassed while everyone was looking at her.She agreed to wear the vest because she feared she would be kicked off the flightshe refused. Isabelle said she spoke to eight other Jetstar staff members before boarding and none of them mentioned anything about her clothing being inappropriate. She added: I didnapost think Iaposd have to deal with something like that - itaposs , I should be able to wear what I want to wear. Jeremy said his weaposs outfit wasnapost inappropriate and didnapost violate the airlineaposs policy against offensive clothing. The airline does not have a policy regarding crop tops.Isabelle wrote an Instagram post complaining about the incident and shared photos of the outfit she was wearing. She wrote to her , followers: So they made a huge scene when I stepped on the plane and made me wait in front of everyone while they searched for something to cover me up with. Then I had to walk all the way to my seat wearing this vest . This is discrimination and humiliation Jet Star Australia. Apparently my top is too small and I couldnapost fly without covering up.  If I had small breasts I guarantee they wouldnapost have said anything. They forced me to put on hi-vis vest.

It’s up to us to make sure we get it right.“It’s been a frustrating season for Callum. He’s one of the young ones with real first-team experience in the Premiership and he had been doing really well in pre-season. Then he picked up a chest infection and broke his foot in a friendly.“He’s had to be patient and had been doing really well in training. Last week we’d been working on how to play against Raith and he did really well. He deserved his chance.“He’s another good young player from the academy who can help the club.“We’ve had Max Anderson and Fin Robertson as well who’ve done great. Then there’s another group coming through – Sam Fisher made his debut on Saturday and Lyall Cameron has been doing well.“What we are looking for is to get that balance right in midfield in the hole left by Jordan McGhee’s injury.”The simplicity of Raith Rovers’ equalising goal at the weekend through former Dee Kyle Benedictus from a short corner was a huge frustration for McPake.Their second also came indirectly from another short corner, this time Reghan Tumilty firing in a superb -yarder after Dundee had cleared.That’s after conceding from a corner against Arbroath in the previous fixture and the Dundee boss admits “we need to get set-plays right”.“It was really frustrating to lose the first goal from a set-piece,” he added.“The second comes from the corner but ends up being an unbelievable strike.“Set-pieces are massive in football, at every level. As a player I always felt they were hugely important and that hasn’t changed now.“We were missing two of our most experienced players in Liam Fontaine and Lee Ashcroft – that’s not to say the two centre-backsdidn’t do well.“But that experienced allows them to organise and spot danger quicker, those goals might not have happened.“The third goal is a really good strike as well but we had chances ourselves. On another day, the result might have been dferent.“But we need to get set-plays right.

For fanatics of our teams on Tayside, it’s been snatched from them.What exactly does that mean for Arabs, Dees and Saintees, though  Dundee fan, and co-host of the Walking Down the Provie Road podcast, Gary Cocker, sums it up well.“I always park in the same place, walk the same way, go in the same gate – I’m a man of routine,” he said.“What I definitely don’t miss is a couple of guys in the stand who shout and scream the whole time!“It’s just nice to have  minutes at the weekend to sit, watch the football and switch my brain off.“It’s familiarity and something I’ve been doing most of my le.“It’s about keeping that connection to Dundee as well because I’ve been in Edinburgh since .“Although there’s Hearts and Hibs nearby, it’s not the same as watching Dundee at Dens.“The thing I miss the most is the anticipation before the start of the half Dundee are shooting towards the Bobby Cox Stand.“That thought of maybe seeing a goal and the players celebrating right in front of me is the best feeling.”Gary, originally from Birkhill but now living and working in Scotland#s capital, has followed the Dark Blues since  after his brother, Craig, introduced him to the club.A season ticket holder, he travelled through on matchdays pre-Covid, using it as an opportunity to catch up with loved ones as well as sample the unique Dens atmosphere.The -year-old added: “It tied in with me being able to see my folks every two weeks. I can’t do that at the moment with all the restrictions.“The game is, obviously, a part of it but it’s not the whole story.“I’ll try watching them playing away – I’ve been to  of the  stadiums and was making good progress up until the pandemic!“All the Lego stadiums – I hate Accies’ ground but I think it’s the away ground I’ve been to most because my we’s family are from Milngavie.“All the games are away for me but Dens holds that familiarity – when I go where I’m all over the place.“If we ever get a new stadium they’ll have to think carefully about how to stop it from becoming a soulless shell of a place.“I’m not saying I want them to recreate the steps on the South Enclosure or leave fox corpses hanging about but I’d like to see Dens incorporated into it.“I would definitely miss it. It’s a pretty costly stadium to run compared to others but it’s still home.”It’s a similar story for St Johnstone fan Kieran Clark. Born in Perth but raised on the Isle of Bute, he now lives and works in St Andrews with football an ever-lasting connection to the Fair City.The -year-old explained: “We went on holiday to Perth – that’s the quality of my childhood, some go to Disneyland, I go to Perth.“We went to a game in  – a top-of-the-table clash against Falkirk in the First Division.“There was quite a big crowd there, it was a sunny day and I’d never been to a game before.“We had to walk all the way from Perth city centre out to McDiarmid Park, we went the wrong way and it ended up about four miles in the end.“When we got there I was blown away by it. The pitch was glowing, it was a decent atmosphere and I’d never seen that many people in the one place before being from a small island.“From that point I became absolutely obsessed.”Kieran, who works in the golf industry and has a season ticket in the main stand, says he “fell in love” with Saints and is itching to get back when possible.“There’s no real family link to supporting St Johnstone – it was really just a day out,” he continued.“Johnny English was on at the cinema at the time so I think McDiarmid Park was better than that!“I fell in love with it and from that point my dad became a St Johnstone fan – he’s a season ticket holder as well.“We actually got beat that day but it’s been a big part of my le ever since.”Kieran added: “I’m a bit of a wannabe hipster. Everyone in my primary school was Celtic or Rangers apart from one Sunderland fan, one Partick Thistle fan and then there was me.“I’d turn up with my St Johnstone programme, sit it on my desk and that was my thing.“We’d travel all the way there for games the following season and the year after when I turned  we actually moved to Perth and that’s when I got a season ticket.“I’ve had one ever since, been to almost every home game and a fair number away, too, all the ups and downs.“It means a lot to me and I’ve had some great moments in the last  years.“I’m itching to get back. My enthusiasm for it hasn’t diminished, arguably it’s even stronger because I’ve realised how much I actually enjoy it and what a void not being able to go leaves.”Although both Gary and Kieran are used to having some distance between them and their first loves, watching from home on live streams doesn’t replicate attending matches.Dee fan Gary commented: “I think, generally, the fans are maybe more disengaged. There is a wee bit of a feeling of distance.“It feels like we are all supporters in name only – like one of those cardboard cut-out fans or like you’re playing a game of Football Manager because you’re not actually seeing it happen.“It’s like collective group therapy and I feel like the mere act of going to a game makes you feel like you’ve done your bit.“Tuning into the stream still doesn’t feel like making the effort. You don’t feel your impact or input.“For the players, they’re not getting that immediate feedback,I can put it that way.“Like when Jordan Marshall dithers on the ball turns back and gives it to Jack Hamilton, he’s not getting anyone going: ‘**** sake!’”Kieran agreed, saying: “It’s a day out. People go on away days but for me the home games are equally like that.“It’s a big part of the routine because you have that at the end of the week to look forward to.“I’ve not been able to go nor have I even been in Perth since or seen my friend Shaun.“I’ve barely seen my dad, which isn’t always a bad thing! But I miss that side of it, too.“It’s not just the game. For me, it’s the whole experience. What I love about the football is it’s the purest form of theatre.“It’s pantomime for adults – you’ve got everything in there. Thrills, spills, excitement, drama and there’s a fair degree of tragedy, too, at times!“There’s also absurdity and humour. All of that comes together and it makes a package that I just love and always have.“For all people criticise the Scottish game, I love the rawness of it and being part of a live game. The atmosphere never gets old.”For most, it boils down to missing the game. For others, it is a personal and heart-rending loss.While those inside the football bubble are caught up in the maelstrom of results, storylines and the minutiae of the game, it is easy to forget what it all actually means.Speaking to supporters brings it home – their passion jumps out.For loyal Arab Craig David, distance was no obstacle pre-Covid either, with him and his Dundonian dad Bryan happily travelling up from Lowestoft, East Anglia, to get back to their roots.In trying times financially for teams across the board, they both bought season tickets for the club’s first campaign back in the Premiership in four years.For the -year-old engineer, whose earliest memories of the Terrors is the  Scottish Cup win, it’s the least they could do.“My dad’s from Dundee so I’ve been supporting Dundee United since Craig Brewster famously put the ball in the net against Rangers in ,” he said.“We used to try to get up three or four times a season, on average.“We’d make a day of it with hospitality but this year my dad and I got season tickets to help the club evenwe couldn’t go.“Nothing beats being under the lights and in the stadium, though.“We usually visit family and because I run the Arabs United fans’ group on Facebook, I put it in there that we’re up as well.“We’d go into The Troll and then The Heggie Suite. We try to do everything we can near the ground and get involved with everyone. It’s always a nice day out, no matter what.“A lot of my friends down here have bought into Dundee United so when I come up next they’re going to come with me.”Craig set up the Arabs United fans’ group on Facebook to maintain a connection with the club from afar after the passing of his uncle Murray five years ago.They honour his le and love of all things United every time they are at Tannadice.Craig explained: “The group, mainly, was to get my dad and I connected with people.“My dad has his friends up there, we used to go on the buses with my uncle Murray but sadly he passed away so there was a big gap there.“We’ve got a plaque for him at Tannadice. We do a little ritual where we go and speak to it or tap it as we’re going down to the ground just to remember him.“He was as hardcore as they come. He used to go to all of the end-of-season dinners and he was very much involved with the club.“My dad and I have kept his name going and taken on the same role to try progress it further with this fans’ group.“When he was ill was just around the relegation yearbut he was alive for all the good moments.“I’m sure he’d have been happy to see us win the Championship and go back into the big time.”Asked what he misses most about the football, Craig added: “Just the atmosphere and father-son connection my dad and I have sitting there watching our team.“He must be proud cheering for his team and then looking over to me and seeing a new generation, passing it down.“As soon as we’re able to, we will % be back, but I don’t mind the streams. Any way of seeing Dundee United is good.“The routine is just making the best of it, seeing your team or listening to them, the main thing is having a team to support.“With Covid and the financial restrictions, I’m just happy to still have Dundee United.”Remembering absent friends and relatives is a feeling also felt across the street at Dens for le-long fan Arran Hill.The -year-old from Charleston, who normally sits in the Bobby Cox Stand with son Oliver, lost his gran, Elizabeth, and mum, Freda, a few years ago and always takes a moment to think about them as he roars on their beloved team.For the Hills, Dundee is a part of the family.Arran said: “When my gran and grandad used to go to the football, everybody on the bus knew them because she’d be sitting there with a flask filled with whisky or vodka.“I get my shouting at the referee from my gran and my mum because they were lunatics at games.“In the days when you could change ends in football, my gran would chase the linesman right up to the halfway lineshe didn’t agree with a decision.“Even now my pals are like: ‘You’re not coming to a match again with me, you’re too loud!’“I always say: ‘If you think I’m bad, you should’ve heard my gran!’“Dundee is a part of the family for me. My mum and I were stewards at the club for many, many years and when I was younger I worked in the canteen and sold the programmes, too.“Gran just loved her football. They stayed directly across from Dens on Provost Road so even when she got older and stopped going to games she could tell by the roar what was going on.“They knew what mood my mum and I would be in when she phoned!”Of his mum’s passing, which occurred shortly after the Dark Blues winning the Championship in , Arran recounted a tale that rams home the importance of football in their lives.He continued: “She passed away suddenly in  from a clot on her lungs. We’d won the league the weekend before at Dens and then the Player of the Year was the following night.“I couldn’t get tickets for love nor money but I managed to scramble and get one and offered it to my mum.“Knowing she was in pain she told me to go. She passed away suddenly the following week.“I had to go and get my dad from Ninewells because he was beside himself, obviously, but it was the trophy parade and presentation at City Chambers that night.“I thought: ‘I’m not going’. My dad, even though he was still hurting, said: ‘If you don’t go, your mum would be mad’.“She’d have told me to go regardless.“Her ashes were scattered at Dens and whenever I go I think of her.”Football is a family affair for Arran and Oliver, with father passing down his passion for the Dee to son.Arran added: “It’s not for me anymore, it’s for the wee man. He’s into it now as much as I was at his age.“After the games he’d always go to the players’ entrance to wait and get photos.“Especially now, I’m a massive Charlie Adam fan, so I’d have loved to meet him with the wee man.“He knows all the players but all the new ones he just knows them from the TV and not actually seeing them. It’s really hard for him – usually he’d be the one telling me who they are and he’s !“He still asks me what time the game’s on and wants to go down.“Usually we’d go to the Penman Lounge butit’s getting used for hospitality then any of the pubs near the ground – the Social Club, Whites Bar or the Clep.“We’d get to Dens in time to watch the teams warm-up. The young lad likes to get there early to chase Cammy Kerr, his favourite player, to get an extra photo with him!“It was me chasing my heroes when I was younger – like Claudio Caniggia and Fabian Caballero. I miss him being able to get that interaction.”Despite everything going on, Arran praised the club and manager James McPake for taking time out of their busy schedule to send Oliver a well-received birthday message.Arran added: “I follow Cammy on Instagram and when I left it late for Oliver’s birthday, I askedhe could do a wee message for him.“He did and Tommy Youngarranged for the manager to do the same.“The fact they did something to wish him a happy birthday, I was over the moon for him.“His face was beaming when he got the messages! I’ve never seen anybody smile so much from cheek to cheek.“When you see those wee eyes light up and he asks you: ‘How did you manage that, dad ’ there’s nothing better.”Keeping the kids entertained is a problem fellow Dee Danielle Ormond knows all too well.And with three Dundee-daft daughters – Lola, Yvie and Elsie – the pandemic has cost her a fortune.“That’s been the hardest thing to adapt to, explaining to the younger generation that we can’t go and see these people,” the -year-old Montrose native said.“It’s really dficult. Yvie’s had her picture taken with James McPake and Cammy Kerr.“She absolute loves Cammy! They miss it loads and are always asking when they can get back but you just don’t have the answers.“They cost me a fortune. Nearly every Saturday I was going through and taking them into the shop, buying something and then taking them for tea.“They can’t stand being in the house all Saturday because it’s just not normal routine.“They ask mewe can just go and drive past Dens because they miss it so much or go by the training ground and seethey can see anybody.“I’m totally demented – I’ve got the whole Dundee shop in my house!”Danielle, who runs a cleaning business and a laundrette in the Angus town, has struggled with not being able to take her regular seat in the main stand as she makes do with PPV games.She added: “I get my Dundee top on but I don’t like it. I’d much rather be going to Dens, your Saturdays feel flat without it.“I sit with Twitter open and blether to all the people I usually see at the game. It’s not the same but it’s just what you would do at the match.“I’d like to get back as soon as possible because you get that support from your fellow-supportersit’s a bad game and you can go for a pint afterwards.“It’s quite stressful and it’s had a massive impact on my le. I feel lost.”For United supporter Ben MacDonald, a season ticket holder in the Eddie Thompson Lower, special moments missed hit home hardest.The -year-old student was gutted Arabs weren’t able to witness the Tangerines lting the Championship title last season and laments the likelihood of the rest of this term passing without their .Ben said: “It just came all of a sudden and my immediate thought was: ‘We’ve got to be declared winners, there’s no way they can take it away from us’.“We didn’t get to celebrate and were hearing things like ‘fans may not be able to get in until ’ and I was thinking: ‘come on, we’ll be in by October!’“Then as the days pass and you realise we’re really not getting in until .”Watching United virtually has been of some solace for Ben in tough times but admits he is still eagerly awaiting the day they get the green light to head for Tannadice en masse.“The online streams have been a saving grace, to be honest,” he added.“You’ve got Twitter and group chats as well – folk are still communicating with each other about games so, although we’re not physically there, I don’t think it’s been too bad.“The news of vaccines has given everyone that bit of hope – surely it shouldn’t be that long before we’re finally back in “Some folk don’t want to risk it but most are chomping at the bit waiting to get the message.“That day will be amazing.”With restrictions across the country only tightening and action below Championship level suspended, it appears that glorious moment could still be some way off.However, when that day comes, it’s clear fans will answer the call and soon be armed with scarves, songs, pies and putdowns. Football and family will emerge victorious.That way of le is all those that truly love the game know.Dundee United’s Calum Butcher issues dressing room rallying cry: ‘Gone are the times you can grab someone by the neck…we need to stick together’\" title\"#Dundee United’s Calum Butcher issues dressing room rallying cry: ‘Gone are the times you can grab someone by the neck…we need to stick together’# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-hibs-calum-butcher-motherwell embed # secretONKsaIW\" data-secret\"ONKsaIW\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.13870070-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.13870070-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.13870070-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.13870070-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"tay road bridge closed to double decker buses due to high winds","story":"The Tay Road Bridge is currently closed to double decker buses due to high winds.The announcement was posted on Twitter shortly before .pm.A mph speed limit has also been set.mdash Tay Road BridgeFebruary , A yellow weather warning for snow is currently in place across Dundee, and an amber warning has been put in place for parts of Angus, Perthshire and Fe for heavy snow from Friday into the weekend.Snow across parts of ScotlandFriday  – Saturday Heavy and persistent #snow is likely to lead to signicant disruption to transport and utilities ❄️❄️Latest info 👉 https:t.co QwDLMfRBfsStay #WeatherAware⚠️⚠️ pic DOIILHwmdash Met OfficeFebruary ,  vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"shettleston-gartnavel-auchenshuggle---gaelic-influences-glasgow-place-names","story":"GAELIC was once a signicant local language in Glasgow and its environs and there is still evidence of its influence today."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-i-loved-twist-dennistoun-palais","story":"Which street did you live on  I belong to Glasgowhellip.I grew up in Easterhouse, on Lochdockart Road.

My boyfriend and I were both on furlough and we enjoyed cooking. I made a page and posted a few pictures of dishes we#d made or places we#d eaten.#I#ve always liked baking and I baked a lot when I was younger. I think it is something I just really enjoy doing and when I was working full-time I didn#t have as much time to bake, so when I was on furlough I could spend my days baking. I really enjoyed it and was baking a few times a week. I posted pictures of my baking and then people started messaging askingthey could buy them.#I made a few cakes for friends and family and they#d always tag my page on social media. Random people started messaging me more and more around September October time to make them things. I was quite hesitant to begin with as it was never my original plan to sell anything. When people started posting more pictures of my stuff on social media, that really helped things kick-off.#With nearly , followers on her page and an audience with a growing appetite for her products, Eve only takes orders via her Instagram page where she can keep on top of requests and orders.#It is a free marketing tool really and without Instagram there wouldn#t be Fat Batch. Everyone is on social media and everyone is always looking for new pages to follow. I think it has really snowballed from people sharing their bakes I have made or just showcasing my page in general,# said Eve.#I have got nearly , followers in the space of seven months which is mad.##People direct message me on Instagram for orders. That#s the way most people will order. I don#t have price lists or product lists on my page just yet, but I need to get round to doing that. I make what people want to be honest. They can direct message me what they would like and I can let them know my availability and take it from there.#I#m nearly fully booked until the end of February for orders, althoughI end up with spare bakes, which I usually do, I post them on my Instagram Stories and people can message to secure them. They tend to go quite quickly. I have toyed with the idea of stopping taking custom orders and just making batches and putting them on my Story. I know it would sell as the bakes all go so fast.#I charge £. for a brookie, £ for a cookie, and for the likes of a Creme Egg cookie I#d charge £. as it is a bit more expensive. As I#m only doing this on the side I think it is reasonable, and I wouldn#t charge what I wouldn#t want to pay.#Working full-time, Eve outlines that while she is loving making treats for people to indulge in, her job in oil and gas takes priority and ensures she doesn#t take on too many orders that would impact her work or personal le.#Since the beginning of this year I must be making around  boxes every day. I try to avoid working at the weekends but I struggle to say no, so I#d say I make around  boxes a week,# said Erin.#Some people might order a few things, some will order  in a box, it really just depends. I make whatever quantities people want andI make more, I can sell it to those who are waiting for me to post on Instagram Stories.#I have been really careful to ensure my baking doesn#t encroach on my full-time job. The baking is just a side thing that has taken off. I keep them very separate. I work from home and finish around -.pm and as soon as I#ve finished I#ll start baking, or go to the shop, or chill for a bit and then start baking. Sometimes I#ll get up at am and bake in the morning instead and then start work after,#I am quite organised in the sense of timings, but when it comes to getting shopping I#m maybe not as organised. I get people staring at me when I#m buying  bars of butter from the shops and I#ve got much better now I#m purchasing items in advance, rather than every day.#Specialising in cookies, brookies # half cookie and half brownie bakes # and millionaire shortbread, Eve uses popular sweets to decorate her over-the-top bakes, showing off her big chunky style delights in the best way.She added: #When I first made then I saw similar products on other foodie Instagram pages and I found a cookie and brownie recipe I loved and put them together to make my brookies.#Since then I have tweaked them to make them the best I can. They are very indulgent and I can decorate them to look really over the top. I knew that#s what people wanted, just something over the top and that will look cool in a picture. Everyone loves the pictures I post and I think it makes them want them more.#With brookies you can put anything in the middle. I#ve got a bit more creative and I#m putting more things in them to make it look more chunky and fat.#I have experimented with a cookie pot before but I want to perfect the recipe. If it is something I can properly develop them I will definitely consider doing them, but I#m focusing on my best sellers just now.She added: #I started off using things like mini Jammie Dodgers and started to think #how can I make it look better #. I got bigger biscuits and stuck them in instead and they just started looked really good. I just think the bigger the better and I#m using products like Milky Bar and Freddo#s which people love.#Big Mannys# Pizza sees huge success with -inch pizza that was too big to be delivered\" title\"#Big Mannys# Pizza sees huge success with -inch pizza that was too big to be delivered# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp lestyle food-and-drink big-mannys-pizza-sees-huge-success-with--inch-pizza embed # secrettuooEiFC\" data-secret\"tuooEiFC\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Aberdeenshire fish and chip shop serves up  free meals to local children\" title\"#Aberdeenshire fish and chip shop serves up  free meals to local children# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp lestyle food-and-drink aberdeenshire-fish-and-chip-shop-serves-up--free-meals-to-local-children embed # secretPztnSIBzkM\" data-secret\"PztnSIBzkM\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/sundaypost/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2021/02/shutterstock_1846277248.jpg ","title":"sponsored puppy first aid could help save your dogs life articleisfree","story":"Puppies can be a great addition to the family, they tend to be curious and have an appetite for exploring and learning all about the world around them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities. RYA Scotland will continue to host online sessions for clubs and training centres and deliver its regular podcast #Off the Water# to keep the boating community informed.PIC:Owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in. _aTarbertHarbour"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that. I havenrsquot seen the exact details of what Mr Blairrsquos think tank have said but I imagine itrsquos relatively sensible, itrsquos about doing it globally rather than just an inidual region of the world.What are others across the world saying Zurab Pololikashvili, the UN World Tourism Organisationrsquos secretary-general, last week told the Global Tourism Crisis Committee in Madrid:

But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America.

The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face.

The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment.

It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world.

He will work with inidual police wildle liaison officers, NGOs, the Scottish Government, NatureScot, RSPB, the SSPCA and Scottish Land and Estates. The position is funded by NatureScot.PC Ross was the community police officer for Dunbar, and has  years of police service and an extensive background in wildle crime issues, community policing, problem solving and educational work.Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment Ben Macpherson MSP said: #Wildle crime is despicable and tackling it has been a long-standing priority for the Scottish Government.#We work closely with a number of agencies to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.#The Animals and Wildle Act, which recently became law, increases the maximum penalties for the most serious wildle crimes and extends the time available to Police Scotland to investigate.#The work of the National Wildle Crime Unit is hugely valued by communities across Scotland and we are committed to supporting it. I look forward to working with PC Ross in the future and congratulate him on his new role.#PC Ross said: #When I was in Edinburgh, very early in my service, I became involved in investigating wildle crime because of my interest and experience in this area. I’ve been a part-time wildle crime officer throughout my whole service and the new job is the pinnacle of my career.#I worked very hard preparing for my interview and was very keen to secure the job, which is a dream post. I am looking forward to settling into the role and working with all the dferent partner agencies which are so important in the fight against wildle crime.#In the six weeks I’ve been in post I’ve concentrated on meeting many of the partner agencies we work with in wildle crime. Unfortunately most of the meetings have had to be done virtually, but I feel they have all been really positive and I look forward to building on these initial foundations, especially when we can meet face to face.#The head of the NWCU, Chief Inspector Hubble added: #I was extremely pleased when PC Ross was successfully appointed as our new Scottish ISO and I am sure he is going to be a valuable asset to policing wildle crime.#Andy Turner, NatureScot wildle crime officer, said: #Eliminating wildle crime is huge priority for us, which is why we’ve provided funding for this post since . Wildle crime doesn’t just cause irreparable damage to Scotland’s nature, it also affects tourism, which in turn impacts on the economy.#We are committed to working with NWCU, Police Scotland and other members of the Partnership for Action Against Wildle Crimeto tackle this challenging issue.#We worked closely with Gavin’s predecessor, Charlie Everitt, to prevent wildle crime and raise awareness. I look forward to continuing to this important work with Gavin and the NWCU in the future.#NWCU’s main role is to assist in the prevention and detection of wildle crime by obtaining and distributing information from a wide range of organisations and by helping police forces investigate wildle crimes. NWCU also produce analysis which highlights local or national threats.The appointment of PC Ross comes after the retirement of PC Charlie Everitt, who had spent the last  years developing the role of Scottish ISO within the National Wildle Crime Unit.PC Everitt furthered countless operations, provided expert advice to police wildle liaison officers and acted as the key central point of contact between the police and a vast range of partner agencies.He was well known throughout the Scottish wildle crime arena and his professional knowledge, enthusiasm, and willingness to assist were beyond question.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems. Their stems grow in lsquosegmentsrsquo and resemble flattened pads, with their flowers being produced at the end of the segments.Although the Christmas-flowering culti is most popular in the UK, there are dferent cultis which flower at dferent times of the year.In their natural habitat, schlumbergera grow on trees or in rocks and generally enjoy shady habitats with high humidity, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms.If yoursquore looking for an unusual and interesting but easy-to-care-for indoor hanging plant, you might consider the aporocactus ndash a group of tree-growing cactus that grow well in a hanging pot.For a cactus with impact, the gymnocalycium mihanovichii is a sure winner. The top part of the stem on this cactus lacks green pigmentand can be bright red, yellow or other amazing colours.So,yoursquore looking for a plant that thrives on neglect, hopefully wersquove given you some ideas!Just remember that the golden rule for cacti and succulents is to under-water rather than over-water ndash too much moisture will cause disease and rot.For more information, take a look on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-column-food-thought-covid","story":"To be able to buy vegetables from the likes of Crunchy Carrot in Dunbar or Phantassie in East Linton is my foodie heaven !It is probably more expensive to shop locally and, as you need to drive to dferent outlets, it does take longer.For hard-pressed working families, this is not always an option.

under the rail bridge on the townrsquos Spott Road to stop the animals from roosting there.Concerns had been raised that birds were swooping from under the bridge and startling drivers, while the animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous and all out of proportion.ldquoNor should the council be thinking of installing netting, as we know many birds can become trapped in netting and suffer horribly before dying.ldquoAlternative solutions have to be found.Vanessa Hudson, leader of Animal Welfare Party, described moves to kill the birds or install anti-bird netting as ldquocompletely out of step with the times.She said: ldquoItrsquos  and time for us to accept that we share our spaces with wild animals, including pigeons, and humane solutions should be pursued.ldquoIt is an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, and nets cause nesting and visiting birds the most horric distress and injury before death by hanging, starvation or dehydration.Guy Merchant, of Bird Control Consultancy Services International , told the Courier that carrying out a cull would be ldquoa waste of time and money.Similarly, he suggested that putting netting under the width of the bridge could create other problems, such as trapping live birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting operation is dramatically reduced and, secondly,you kick all the resident birds out from the under the bridge they are going to go to peoplersquos properties in Dunbar and cause a huge nuisance.\"Mr Merchant said that left the birds to roost and perch in the central reservation of the bridge and their droppings would fall onto the road, rather than the pavement.At a meeting of Dunbar Community Council last month, it was revealed that work under the bridge was due to take place in mid-February.East Lothian Council said that the bridge was lsquohomersquo to ldquohundreds of pigeons which are causing problems for drivers and also fouling the footpath.It was said that work could take up to five days while the underside of the bridge was cleaned and re-netted in a bid to prevent pigeons from roosting there in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-new-variant-symptoms-revealed-research","story":"Data released by the Office for National Statisticsshow that some symptoms appear

By not filling the holes in, they will collapse in among themselves and create a new soil structure.\"It will allow your lawn to breathe again. That job can be done pretty much any time from now up until May, when it gets too dry. You can hire a hollow tine aerator to do the job or get hold of a hand aerator which can be used on a regular basis.\"Dont fill in the holes\"A lot of people fill the holes theyve created for aeration with sand. I wouldnt do that because sand is inert - it doesnt do any good. Let the holes stay open for root development and improved drainage. You wont notice them after a few weeks, when you start to mow your grass.\"Move the goalpostsIf you have obstacles such as goalposts, trampolines or sandpits on your lawn, move themyou have space, to stop specic areas from compacting due to heavy traffic, or suffering from lack of light, he suggests.Do you need to reseed \"Scary the lawn lightly just to clean some of the dead grass out and refresh the stronger grass to recreate more growth. Ideally use a mechanical scarier,\" says Hedges-Gower. \"If you havent enough grass, you can overseed but you must create an environment to give it a good success rate.\"Pick the right seedIf youre reseeding bald patches or part of your lawn that looks a bit thin, Hedges-Gower suggests using a lawn seed mix containing ryegrass, fescue and bentgrass. But he notes you have to have the right soil conditions for any seed to be robust.Take extra measures on well-worn patches\"Ultimately,you have an area thats wearing out, its because we are walking on it and compacting it. If you cant move the goalpost or other garden toys, look at the heavy wear areas and do some more intermediate aeration on them to prevent or slow down the process of the areas wearing out,the weather suits,\" says Hedges-Gower.\"Alternatively, prick the area with a garden fork to allow the moisture to penetrate the areas to get to the roots, using the fork to about a in depth.\"Feed your lawn in spring as the nutrients from rainfall will have leached through. By May you should be reaping the benefits.\"Create a wider lawn entrance\"Remove a bit of pathway so that when you do walk on to the lawn, theres a wider area to walk on. Butyou know there are pinch points that suffer, you have to look at prevention.\"Help your lawn in autumn\"Do more to high traffic areas in autumn, which will prevent some of your problems the next spring. You may want to topdress a muddy area with sandy loam to make it less muddy in future, but you need to do that in addition to hollow tine work and aeration.\"Its all about rebalancing the growing environment. Spring and autumn are essential times to reseed. Do it as a repetition, to build the strength of your grass year on year.\"Let your grass grow longer\"The bigger cushion you can have, the stronger the plant you have and the more wear tolerance it will have, regardless of whether its a heavy wear grass or not.

How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections. Who knows what makes people enter a parallel world to the one beneath our feet. Personally, however, I find the idea that facts and evidence no longer matter even scarier than Covid.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray. Her biggest political threat now comes from within her own party.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Are we expected to conclude that this in some way has a bearing on the case for or against independence  Is the implication that Scots, as a nation, are intellectually deficient compared to their southern neighbours and would be incapable, regardless of their political allegiances, of electing a competent Government in an independent nation  Or is it another example of the myth peddled by unionists that an independent Scotland would be a one-party state governed in perpetuity by the SNP The competence or otherwise of inidual politicians or political parties has no bearing on the democratic deficit so clearly summed up on these pages by Ruth Marrwho described Scotland as a nation held prisoner the overwhelming numerical facts mean that the cell key will always be held by voters south of the Border.Finally, as an aside and as a member of the over- cohort, I would add that very few acquaintances of my generation have expressed any dissatisfaction with their own vaccination experience.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.BREXIT AND THE PANDEMICWHILE I understand the concerns of John Dunlopregarding the need for constitutional change during a pandemic, I also have concerns. In spite of the pandemic, the UK Government pursued Brexit. This was the greatest change to the UK constitution in  years. It was not prepared to extend negotiations until such time as the pandemic was over. The UK Government demonstrated perfectly to the SNP that it is possible to carry out constitutional change during a pandemic.Duncan Stirling, Cardross.* SOMEONE called Alister Jack has been popping up in The Herald in recent days.

Is this to be tolerated  Can a witness simply pick and choose whether he will attend There is something very rotten at the heart of this matter, and it is time that either the committee was given full powers to compel witnesses to attend and provide answers to questions or  the entire shebang was handed over to a properly-constituted judicial inquiry, with full judicial powers to compel witnesses to attend and to answer questions, on pain of judicial sanctions.

The real reason for the visit, I am convinced, was the onset of panic at the string of Scottish poll results showing a majority for independence.As for Mr Joness advice to pensioners to \"squirrel plenty of money away\" to pay for future council tax rises, I would ask Mr. Jones: what with Alison Lambie, Stirling.SPINNING OVER THE VACCINESJANE Laxhas fallen for the UK Governmentrsquos spin over Covid jags, as England has similar problems over supplies.On January , NHS England advised that all care home residents and staff would receive their first jag by  January ldquoat the latest but letters only went out last week. At the weekend several leading care home operators in England complained that only around a half of residents had been vaccinated due to a shortage of supplies.England also experienced the same problems over Sunday vaccinations, as the UK administered , doses on Saturday, January  but only managed around half as many the following day.Extrapolating from the Scottish data that the UK Government tried to suppress, the UK may be administering vaccines at around half the pace it receives supply, yet the same UK Government and the unionist parties are spinning and politicising the vaccine roll-out in Scotland.This of course has been taken up by the media, including the BBC, yet they steadfastly refuse to publish the easily-available comparable number of cases and mortality rates in the four home nations as this shows Scotland in a much better light thanks to the tireless efforts of our NHS staff and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos clear leadership.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.PENALISED FOR SHIELDINGMY we and I are both  and I must confess I am bemused by the logic behind the vaccination programme in our health board area.The s and s have been vaccinated by our hard-working GPs in a local centre set up within the village a few minutes walk away. My we and several of our friends neighbours of a similar age received their letters on January  inviting them for vaccination on February  at the town hall of the adjacent town some three miles away, not a problem. Being previously placed in the shielding category and thus considered \"extremely clinically vulnerable\", I received my vaccination invitation on February  for an appointment on February  at a centre set up in another town eight miles distant. Therefore being placed in the vulnerable group has resulted in my having to wait longer and travel further than would have been the case had I been left in my age group cohort.I am in the fortunate position of being able to drive. If this were not the case I would have to have left the house before am taking a total of three buses to arrive for my : appointment.

There is potential for a win-win, here, for ing lost species, for Reserve visitors to enjoy and for getting hares back to favourable conservation status in Scotland, said Alex Hogg, chairman of the SGA.:Mountain hare saved by grouse moorldquoThere is a willingness for gamekeepers to discuss this with the community group and we hope a virtual meeting can take place after they get their feet under the desk.ldquoIf all the tests can be met, we could see mountain hares back at Langholm. That would be a special achievement. If they were to re-establish successfully, it could also have a longer term benefit as a food source for the golden eagles which have been reintroduced to the south of Scotland.Last year, MSPs voted to ban the unlicensed culling of mountain hares and make them a protected species.Concerns had been growing about the practice but gamekeepers insisted Holyrood made a \"grave mistake\" and that the move was bad for land management.The ban is an addition to a new law to increase sentencing for wildle crime.Under the new Animals and Wildle Bill passed by MSPs, the worst animal cruelty offences will be punishable by up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.From March  it will be illegal to intentionally kill, injure or take mountain hares at any time across Scotland unless a licence is obtained.Previously a licence would be required during the closed season. This will now be the case throughout the whole year.The new licensing arrangement will be overseen by NatureScot, with licences issued only under certain circumstances, such as concerns for public health or protection of crops and timber.ldquoNow that the new laws to protect mountain hares are passed, there is no longer an ability to control hare populations on our moors, said Mark Ewart, co-ordinator of The Southern Uplands Moorland Group.ldquoIt makes sense to use surplus populations from grouse moors to try to re-establish the species where, or to build up fragmented populations so they become more resilient.ldquoResearch points to there being not enough recruitment, in areas away from grouse moors, to sustain the species in the longer run. Rather than watch them die on our moors from disease, which is pointless, it makes sense to use the surplus to help the species recover.Donald Fraser, NatureScots head of wildle management, added: \"Mountain hares ndash our only native hare ndash are an important and valued species in the Scottish hills.\"This increased protection will help ensure healthy populations of mountain hares can be found and enjoyed in the mountains, while giving some recourse when there is a need to prevent damage being caused to saplings or sensitive habitats. We are also working with several partner organisations to continue to improve our understanding of mountain hare populations across Scotland, along with other work to support their conservation status.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12288193.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ishga-hails-janey-godley-effect-spike-online-sales-hand-sanitiser","story":"Now a luxury Hebridean cosmetic brand has credited actress and comedian Janey Godley for helping to drive a big rise in online sales.The founder of ishga said sales of its hand sanitiser had ldquogone bonkers after she shared a video last month on social media saying how much she loved the product and the organic brand.Malcolm Macrae said Ms Godley, who became an online hit herself last year thanks to her First Minister briefing voiceovers, was a long-time customer and had not been asked to endorse the product but said the firm was delighted with the response.: Islay distillers urge whisky drinkers to go one tin lighterThe Lewis-based firm incorporates seaweed into its skincare and lestyle products, which is known for its healing properties.Mr Macrae, whose background is in marine biology, said the firm wanted the product to be ldquoas far away from possible from the generic ldquoskin-stripping sanitisers found in supermarkets and hospitals, and it has been a major success for the brand, contributing around  per cent of turnover during the summer months.He said: ldquoOne of the things we did during furlough, we worked with the Harris distillery and a firm called Essence of Harris to make hand sanitiser using World Health Organisation guidelines, and we were giving that out for free to hospitals and carers and local businesses.ldquoOnce we got down the road a bit we realised this was something we could do more with.

his views on the possibility by Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell, Mr Swinney said: ldquoI think itrsquos a reasonable proposition.Amid fears over unequal access to digital technology and broadband connectivity, the Education Secretary also praised the resourcefulness displayed by schools in reaching out to pupils during lockdown.The Perthshire North MSP highlighted the example of youngsters in his own constituency who have been able to obtain learning resources in local convenience stores.ldquoI think we have to have scope in our consideration to address some of these legitimate practical challenges that might exist for young people to engage in their learning, he said during a meeting of Holyroodrsquos Education and Skills Committee.ldquoIf a young person was struggling in relation to digital access, perhaps through connectivity challenges in a particular locality, schools have been resourced and supported to enable them to address that in other ways.ldquoSo while it is desirable

cover a number of dferent towns and villages are available in convenience stores in dferent parts of the community.ldquoSo schools are really thinking through: how do they reach young people  How do they engage them in their learning Education Secretary John Swinney.His remarks come amid ongoing concern over iation in access to online teaching across Scotland.The Herald told at the end of last

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not. So when we come to the end of the restrictions and to rebuilding our economy, we must also look at rebuilding our own education system.”Reflecting on the impact of Government plans to renege on the . per cent Gross National Income target for international development, a Liberal Democrat policy while in Government, Mr Carmichael said: “Giving opportunities to young people in the developing world is not some act of altruism it is actually good for our own children and communities. I look at the work that has been done by Anderson High School in Lerwick for decades now through the Global Classroom Partnership, and I see what that has added to young people in Shetland. “The money—in hard cash terms—that we would be required to put in to meet the .% GNI target would already be much reduced not actually to meet that . per cent target is criminal. The Government must think about this again, not just for the benefit of people in the developing world, but for the benefit of our own children and their educational opportunities.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, it’s been particularly dficult for those in the islands given broadband constraints and the fact that more parents are expected to work since we’re in a Level Three area.“While everyone is clearly adapting and doing the best they can, the obvious benefits to young people of being at school, both in terms of their learning and social interactions, cannot be overstated.  Indeed, in her statement to parliament this week, the First insisted the government would use ‘every inch of headroom’ available to them to get children back to school safely.“On that basis, it seems logical to look seriously at the possibility of applying a more localised approach to the reopening of schools.“I appreciate that there will be many factors to be taken into account, but I welcome the Education Secretary’s recognition of the case for a more ‘tailored’ approach, where this can be done safely.

So itrsquos something to be celebrated.Professor Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said: ldquoI know of vaccinators who have been trained and have time to do more vaccinating ndash the simple issue is that this is a vaccine supply issue as to why we cannot do more.ldquoPre-ordering and identying production facilities before we knewthe vaccine would work is why we are as advanced in our vaccination coverage as we are now.ldquoVaccine supply issues have been a long-standing problem well before this need for Covid- vaccines and to produce a brand new vaccine in bulk this quickly is a major achievement.Itrsquos fantastic that  million people in the UK have got their first dose of the vaccine.Thank you to everyone who has helped make this possible. pic FExOCySmdash Boris JohnsonFebruary , Prof Neal added: ldquoAnyone who is saying what the UK has achieved with the vaccine rollout is not good enough needs to identy what they would have done dferently.Professor Lawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology, University of Warwick, said: ldquoThis is a great achievement and demonstrates what we can be accomplished when we empower the NHS locally.He added: ldquoWe have secured access to over  million doses of the seven most promising vaccines and now have a proven infrastructure for vaccine delivery.Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ldquoThe NHS is doing everything it can to protect the most vulnerable and will continue to expand the vaccination programme ever further in the coming weeks to save as many lives as possible.The Government is calling on the public to support the rollout by helping friends and family to make it to their vaccine appointments, and to keep up to date with NHS advice during the pandemic.It is also asking for volunteers to join vaccine trials and trials for Covid- treatments.copy -.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points. The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr. It is very likely that the fishing station from the time of Charles I mentioned by the Hebridean author Martin Martinwas located here. Could the fishing station’s ruin have been later repurposed as a shieling It may be, then, that when Ceit was looking for a local setting for the story she had originally heard in Appin, moving the tale to Hearmatraigh made it more relevant and appealing to her listeners. But with this clever transfer she also skilfully preserved the cultural signicance of its original moorland setting: a place out in the wilderness where dangerous supernatural creatures could overwhelm the unwary.Ceit Dix’s stories demonstrate the richness and iety of Gaelic traditional culture and offer a glimpse of how skilled storytellers adapt and localise their tales to entertain and intrigue their dferent audiences. contains some , oral recordings of songs, music, poetry and factual information made in Scotland and further afield."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1611861061543.jpg--paul_watters__prawn_and_red_pepper_chowder.jpg?1611861061000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210128newspaul watters prawn and red pepper chowder","story":"INTERNATIONAL chef, Paul Watters, has over  years experience in the culinary industry.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

There is a carefully rehearsed procedure of name taking, mask changing and hand sanitising at the initial entry point where these vital duties are among the many roles taken up by volunteers such as Arthur Halligey who was the first greeter on Friday morning.Arthur, part of the Volunteer Now group, is just one of an army of citizens doing their best to help out with the operation and their dedication and community spirit has been hailed as vital by Sinead OKane, Assistant Director of Governance and Risk Management - essentially the woman who is charged with keeping the process running smoothly.A good description for Sinead would be a cocktail of irrepressible energy mixed with an indefatigable sense of humour.Sinead is obviously very serious about her role and she has her fair share of stories about her experiences during the course of the pandemic, but when this grim periodfades sooner rather than later, Ill take a bet that her motivational skills will live long in the memory of all those she has worked with.And like all good leaders, she knows the worth of all those around her who have thrown their energies into the process.IN IT TOGETHERSineads team really does bring meaning to that somewhat cliched phrase of were all in it together - in their case it has never been more important to be all in.From the start this has been a massive logistical operation with literally every department doing their umost to provide this service.I cannot speak highly enough of these people. Everyone - volunteers, the administrative staff and of course the nurses, midwives, Allied Health Professionals and NIAS and support services have really been all hands to the pumps , she says.The timetable for vaccinations is, of neccessity, honed down to a fine art. We estimate that from entry to exit, the process lasts around  minutes - and half of that is spent seated post-jab as a precaution on carefully cleaned chairs adjacent to the exit where recipients receive their final documentation.Behind the scenes, the flow of the all important vaccine is controlled by a team of pharmacists under Deputy Head of Pharmacy for the Trust, Stephanie Tohill, who reiterates Sineads words on the united effort.I’ve got the greatest respect for everyone involved, she says. Hard to believe weve been doing this for six weeks and we have a long way to go as we move through the ious age groups.So what does this monumental operation come down to  Saving lives is the very obvious answer. Protecting health and social care services is another major factor.But Sinead, in typical fashion, boils it all down to one word - people.Im sometimes almost overwhelmed by the reactions we get from the people who pass through. “They are so kind with their words and their support.The one incident that really sticks in my mind is a conversation I had with a gentleman on palliative care who received his vaccination.He looked at me and thanked us all, saying this means I dont have to die alone. That hit hard.But then she added with typical humour: In fact he ended up having to console me!In a pandemic riddled with cliches theres one that holds very true. If you didnt laugh, youd cry.Lets all hope that the efforts of all those behind the operation at the Seven Towers Leisure Centre bring some much needed fun and laughter into all our lives.

However, the UK is establishing a similar scheme, the Turing programme - named after the mathematician Alan Turing.But the Irish government has said it will support NI students on Erasmus. Its Department of Further and Higher Education said support for NI students would run from September.The department said: Eligible NI students will be able to register with Irish higher education institutions that hold the Erasmus Mobility Charter for the duration of their planned mobility.The NI Department for the Economy said its officials had not been involed in the development of plans in the Republic, saying they were a matter for the Irish Government.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSimon Harris FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSimon HarrisBut the department said this week: Simon Harris TD, Minister of Further and Higher Education, Innovation and Science, has however committed to ongoing engagement with Minister Dodds on this issue as the detail of the proposed arrangements are developed further, so that the department can consider any implications from a Northern Ireland perspective. The two ministers are also scheduled to meet shortly to discuss the proposed arrangements in more detail.The Irish department said its officials had been engaging with the Higher Education Authority, Irish higher education institutions and with NI institutions on the scheme, and that more meetings were planned. We understand that current Erasmus mobilities in NI are funded by the British Council until the end of the current academic year, this scheme is planned to come into operation at the start of the next academic year in September .Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin had claimed Minister Dodds had shown a lack of engagement with the Irish government. But she welcomed confirmation of meeting with Mr Harris, saying Minister Dodds has now shown sense in supporting students in the north.Ms McLaughlin also said the Turing scheme was an inadequate replacement for Erasmus as it would not fund inward student stays.In response to an assmebly question, Minister Dodds said the UK government is putting £m into the Turing scheme to give students periods of international mobility, including outside the EU.That would enable them to reach their full potential and contribute more effectively to the economy of NI and to working in a global eocnomy.Mrs Dodds said her officials were working with the UK government to ensure the scheme can best meet the needs of NI. But she confirmed that the Turing scheme would not fund projects which previously benefited from Erasmus support - and would not fund the stays of international students here.

Before the UK left the EU, Johnsons of Whixley sold £, of plants to Northern Ireland customers every year.The company said new and impractical restrictions had hampered long-standing trading relationships.Plants which originate from a bare root young plant, or those that have had any contact with the soil, evencontainer grown, are considered a risk because of the likely legacy of soil residue, which has the potential to carry pathogens or nematodes, Johnsons said.While not impossible, soil residue removal is impractical and would defeat the point of rootballing and containerisation.Long-standing customers of Johnsons and many other nurseries are left with no choice but to go directly to EU suppliers because there are no restrictions on legacy soil residue between EU members or affiliates in the guise of Northern Ireland. Johnsons head of production and procurement Jonathan Whittemore said: This legislation penalises UK growers and gives an immediate competitive advantage to EU suppliers, who may go on to monopolise supply into an existing part of the UK at the expense of our business and the wider industry.Belfast Most ReadDissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyFoster condemns UVF #show of strength# after masked men patrol Belfast streetsNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songBelfast Cltonville Road murder victim linked to dissident republicansNI traffic alerts: Eglantine Place, Belfast closed after fire breaks out at homeLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland Protocol will not be scrapped – DublinWell known NI Manchester United fan plans poignant tribute toMunich air disaster victims Co Down chef fined after admitting baking cannabis browniesJailed breast surgeon:  patients still to be tracedSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Latest from Belfast Raab demands release of Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi after police chargesClimate expert warns Prime Minister over ‘contemptuous’ coal mine plansCompass sales slide as free school meals hamper arm recovers after outcrySturgeon: Over-simplistic to argue Brexit benefit for Covid- vaccinesPucks, lions and chainsaws – freak injuries in sport,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Men are five times more likely to use their phone while driving - % of those detected for the offence in the  months to last December were male. Half of those detected were aged between  and . More than , drivers were also stopped for speeding or driving without insurance. Those aged between  and  were again most likely to be detected for both offences. Almost , men and , women were detected driving without insurance. More than , men were caught speeding, along with , women. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":true  The figures come as new legislation is introduced that will mean tougher penalties for those caught using their mobile phones while driving. Offenders will now be given six penalty points instead of three, and will receive a fine of £ instead of £. Those offending for a second time, or who have  points on their licence, will face a court hearing and disqualication, with fines of up to £,.Newly-qualied drivers who have an upper limit of six points for the first two years after passing their driving test will face an immediate ban.The move brings legislation in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK where the laws were changed in March . Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said she was taking a zero tolerance approach to irresponsible behaviour on the roads. Despite the risks of using a mobile phone whilst driving, too many people continue to flout the law on a daily basis, she said. Distraction while driving is one of the main causes of road traffic collisions.My message today couldn#t be clearer - drive responsibly, put your phone down or risk losing your licence. This is not a minor offence and you will not get away with it.PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said drivers should be free from distraction and focusing on the road while behind the wheel. He said: Our figures clearly indicate that driver distraction, together with inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving are consistently the main causes of the most serious crashes which kill and injure people on roads across Northern Ireland.No phone call, no message, no social media update is more important than the potentially catastrophic consequence of not paying full attention when driving a vehicle.Belfast Most ReadDissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyFoster condemns UVF #show of strength# after masked men patrol Belfast streetsNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songBelfast Cltonville Road murder victim linked to dissident republicansNI traffic alerts: Eglantine Place, Belfast closed after fire breaks out at homeLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland Protocol will not be scrapped – DublinWell known NI Manchester United fan plans poignant tribute toMunich air disaster victims Co Down chef fined after admitting baking cannabis browniesJailed breast surgeon:  patients still to be tracedSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Latest from Belfast Sturgeon: Over-simplistic to argue Brexit benefit for Covid- vaccinesPucks, lions and chainsaws – freak injuries in sportJohnny Sexton: Ireland must earn right to make Eddie Jones-style proclamationsA look at first ever Test on th anniversary of England-Scotland clashNepal paralysed by general strike in protests against prime minister,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Last night Sir Tom#s memory was marked with a national clap.In Belfast, the Lord Mayor opened an online book of condolence. Alderman Frank McCoubrey said: Captain Sir Tom captured the heart of the nation and was an inspiration to us all.Health Minister Robin Swann also paid tribute to Sir Tom.

He became the epitome of all that is good and noble about how we have come together in a common cause of defeating Covid and supporting our health service and our health workers, he said.However, a row broke out after Sinn Fein did not pay tribute during a meeting of Fermanagh and Omagh council.The Belfastcontacted Barry McElduff, the party#s group leader on the council, but he refused to comment.It drew criticism from DUP councillor Errol Thompson, who said: Captain Tom was someone who fundraised for our country as a whole and a lot of that funding came towards our own Trusts here. The Western Trust received £, from his efforts and the Southern Trust received £,. What a treasure he was. It is disappointing and I know other people who would call themselves nationalists or republicans actually did pay tribute.He added: They [SF] probably had their own reasons for doing it.During the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Victor Warrington said: The man was a great inspiration at the start of this pandemic, with his efforts of doing the walk to raise millions for the NHS. He had a great le of  years and would have had some great stories to tell. On behalf of my party, I want to express our sincere sympathies.This was followed by a tribute from Mr Thompson of the DUP.Independent councillor Emmet McAleer said: The money that Captain Sir Tom raised during his activities was absolutely inspiring.Independent councillor Josephine Deehan told members she was greatly saddened.Another independent, Donal O#Cofaigh, referred to Sir Tom#s inspirational efforts.SDLP councillor Paul Blake said he was a real inspiration, adding: We owe a great debt of gratitude.Yesterday, hours before a national clap in his memory took place, the House of Commons fell silent in tribute to Sir Tom.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the centenarian had dedicated his le to serving the needs of so many others. He said: We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at pm this evening. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Captain Tom#s contribution - having raised more than £m for the NHS during the first coronavirus lockdown - will be formally marked, possibly with a statue.Belfast Most ReadDissident Danny McClean murdered in Belfast had spent five years in British ArmyFoster condemns UVF #show of strength# after masked men patrol Belfast streetsNI teen who wouldn#t stop singingFields of Athenry to police fined £ and told to learn whole songBelfast Cltonville Road murder victim linked to dissident republicansNI traffic alerts: Eglantine Place, Belfast closed after fire breaks out at homeLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland Protocol will not be scrapped – DublinWell known NI Manchester United fan plans poignant tribute toMunich air disaster victims Co Down chef fined after admitting baking cannabis browniesJailed breast surgeon:  patients still to be tracedLatest from Belfast Compass sales slide as free school meals hamper arm recovers after outcrySturgeon: Over-simplistic to argue Brexit benefit for Covid- vaccinesPucks, lions and chainsaws – freak injuries in sportJohnny Sexton: Ireland must earn right to make Eddie Jones-style proclamationsA look at first ever Test on th anniversary of England-Scotland clash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Breandaacuten McNally died in November  after suffering from a brain tumour and his sister Aoe McNally has now launched an energetic fundraising challenge to fund research into the condition. Aoes effort comes after her brother Ruairiacute raised pound, through a birthday fundraiser, and she will be attempting to walk , steps every day during the month of February along with a number of friends. The money will go towards Brain Tumour Research, a UK-based charity dedicated to raising funds for continuous and sustainable scientic research into brain tumours. googletag.cmd.push “Research into brain tumours gets less than on percent of the national fundraising budget for cancer research and my aunt had signed a petition, so she was getting the emails,” she told the County Derry Post. “My brother had done the fundraiser for his birthday as well and she sent me on the email to seeI would want to give it a go in February. “I created the fundraiser and a load of my friends did too, and all of a sudden everyone was getting on board. I added up the other night there was over pound, raised in total already.” googletag.cmd.push The fundraiser has had a global reach. Breandy had spent time in both Australia and America, and he has left such an impression that the support has been huge. Aoe and Ruairiacute pictured with Breandaacuten in . “Breandy was that far travelled that his name has spread to all corners of the world,” said Aoe. “Its overwhelming the amount of support its received, and you dont realise how quickly it spreads. I have had people on to me from Australia and America. “I actually sat down and cried on Tuesday night because I couldnt believe how many people had donated to it. They were happy tears.     “He didnt let it get him down, he just fought on with it. One of his friends posted saying his attitude to le was an inspiration to everyone and thats true.” With such a large amount already raised, Aoe is now facing the reality of a , step marathon in the month of February. “You think , steps isnt a wile lot, but whenever youre stuck in the house and its raining outside, there arent too many places you can go to get the steps up,”she said. “In the good weather I would go walking with my mummy, butI look out and its raining, Ill usually get back into bed. “Breandy was probably the big exercise man in our family!” A donation to the fundraiser can be made by visiting Aoes , Steps Challenge Facebook page, or you can help by signing the Brain Tumour Research petition on their website.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina.

In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A further .% of respondents said they accessed political content a few times a week, while just .% said they never access it. However, despite the high levels of interest in local politics, .% of those surveyed said they would never contact local representatives about an issue or problem they are facing. .% did indicate they would contact a local representative at least once throughout the course of the year. googletag.cmd.push  When asked about confidence in their elected representatives, the general trend was the more local the politics, the greater the confidence. .% of respondents either agreed or strongly agreed their local councillors took their issues seriously, while .% indicated a similar response when thinking of their MLAs. Just .% of those surveyed said they agreed or strongly agreed their local MPs took their issues seriously, while .% indicated they either disagreed or strongly disagreed. % of respondents agreed or strongly agreed local councillors work hard for their areas, with the figure dropping to .% for MLAs.  Just .% of those surveyed agreed or strongly agreed local MPs work hard for their areas, with .% strongly disagreeing with the statement. googletag.cmd.push When askedthey saw their local politicians as role models for the community, the majority of respondents disagreed. % disagreed or strongly disagreed local councillors were role models, while the figure for MLAs was .%. Almost three quartersof respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that their local MPs were role models. When it was necessary to seek help, however, our respondents indicated they knew where to look. .% of those surveyed agreed or strongly agreed that they knew which politicians they could go tothey needed help with an issue.  The majority of those surveyedwere not members of a political party, but .% of respondents said they had attended a political protest or rally.     Causeway Coast and Glens was the most politically active of the local government districts, with .% of its respondents party members and .% having attended a protest or rally. Asked to comment on issues in local politics they felt were important, a number of respondents expressed concern with sectarianism in the decision making process. “Our local councillors and mla’s work hard for their local areas daily resolving local issues,” said one respondent. “Our MP is non-existent, our council is out of touch, but those voting against some things do not rely on votes in thar area. An undercurrent of bigotry exists in decision making.” “We need less green  orange politics and need to start seeing what we have in common. In NI these dferences are minimal when it comes down to the important issues,” added another.  One respondent simply said it was time to end the sectarian diatribes. Another person surveyed felt the boundaries of the local councils needed looked at again. “Limavady should be part of Derry  Strabane Council as it is with health. Coleraine ignores us once they have our vote,” they said. Another respondent criticised local politicians for a perceived lack of ambition. “I feel local reps are usually very responsive to very local need and cases,” they said. “I do however think there at times is a lack of vision and too much of the there are far bigger issues type of response to positive ideas. “A poverty of ambitions only creates greater issues down the line. I think Derry needs to be far more proactive to issues that will arise rather than just reactive to the problems we already face.” Councillor Kathleen McGurk told the County Derry Post the proximity of councillors to their areas could be behind the greater indications of confidence. “A lot of people know their local councillors personally, or know of them. A lot of the issues we get sent our way are things that impact peoples day-to-day lives,” she said. “If you broke it down to how close your MP lives to you, those that live closer to their MP would probably have a lot of trust in them, whereas those that maybe live at the other end of the constituency might not know them from Adam.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She had two parts in Marcella. One was in the background where you could vaguely see her and the other one is about four seconds of just her in the shot. She is dancing up and down excited to see herself and tell family and friends and has loved every minute of it. Colleen believes Caoimhes distinctive red hair has been an advantage and has helped her stand out when she has been chosen for parts. googletag.cmd.push Shes easily spotted because of the red hair, shes very distinctive, she said.

The -year-old, who helped raised more than poundmillion for the health service last year through a fundraising walk around his garden, died earlier today after contracting Covid-. The Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor Brian Tierney, has expressed his sadness at the news. Adding his voice to the many who offered their sympathies to Captain Toms family today, Mayor Tierney said he had achieved a remarkable thing when he lted the spirits of the world with his kindness. googletag.cmd.push I was deeply saddened today to hear such tragic news, particularly as Captain Tom did so much to raise awareness of Covid and the pressures on the health service. His simple gesture of determination and kindness captured the imagination of everyone and inspired and united people in the fight against this terrible virus. Sadly, he has joined the many thousands who have so tragically been stolen from us. Captain Sir Tom Moore will always be remembered as a beacon of hope in the darkest of times, and an example to us all. I think it is only right that local people should have the opportunity to send their personal condolences and thanks to Captain Toms family, so I will open an online Book of Condolence tomorrow. googletag.cmd.push I think thathe is to have any lasting legacy it should be in the actions of every one of us as we protect those around us from the harshest effects of this virus. Please let us all remember Captain Tom, and in his memory always put the safety of others first and foremost in our thoughts. Further details will follow tomorrow on the Book of Condolence, which will be available on the Councils website atderrystrabane      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When you are driving, your focus should be on the road and what other road users are doing, free from any distraction. “Our figures clearly indicate that driver distraction, together with inappropriate speed, drink and drug driving are consistently the main causes of the most serious crashes which kill and injure people on roads across Northern Ireland.

Will it be a long slow recovery or a rapid bounce back to the economy we had in February   I believe there will be a rapid recovery, mainly due to the fact that weve sunk to such a low base. By April , UK GDP had fallen % in two months. They did recover as the lockdowns ended but the Bank of Englandhave forecast a UK GDP growth of -% in  and a +% in . A decline like the Covid dip hasnt been seen since World War Two. googletag.cmd.push The good news, however, is the pace of recovery and most economists predict it will be rapid. Its with this rapid recovery in mind that Im focused on how Derry can benefit. Its fair to say people in Derry are fed up with the constant battle to take Derry to the next level. We look enviously at cities like Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast and ask why are they doing so well  Galway, which is half the size of Derry, has , students at the National University of Ireland Galway compared with , at Magee CollegeDerry. In , Galway attracted the second highest number of overseas visitors to Ireland, beating the much larger cities of Cork and Limerick. They even beat the world famous Kerry. googletag.cmd.push Galwayattracted .m tourists who spent €bn in the county or city.  Derry on the other hand reported a tourism spend of poundm in  which was up from poundm in . These figures were presented to the Derry City  Strabane District Council by Visit Derry on September . They also were keen to add that by  they expected income from tourism to reach poundm. It made a great headline but when you actually let it sink in and compare it to Galway, its pathetic. Even forgetting the fact that the Galway figure is two years older, we basically generate less than % of what Galway generates in tourism revenue.     If Derry was part of the Republic of Ireland, we would be around th in the Failte Ireland published list, comparing with the likes of Louth and Cavan. Remember folks we are the fth biggest city in Ireland and the only Walled City on the island. We shouldnt be languishing in th place. I compare ONLY these two statistics to highlight the complete inequality that exists. If Derry had , students for example and you agree with the research done by Experian who in , which indicated that a student spend is over pound, a yearthen that immediately adds poundm spend into the local economy. This drives jobs and prosperity. If we attracted % of the tourists Galway gets, we would pull in approximately poundm, compared to the poundm. These two wins for Derry would transform Derry and put pound-m more into the local economy annually. I havent even considered the Foreign Direct Investment numbers or infrastructure support Galway gets because I wanted to demonstrate just how investment in further educationand tourism could transform Derry. So how do we solve this problem  The first thing we need to do is get to the heart of Government in NI and convince them there is a complete regional imbalance. We need them to admit there is actually institutionalised bias towards many places in NI including Derry. This wont be easy but the recent narrative on balancing up does offer some hope. There also seems a drive within the New Decade New Approach to do things dferently and perhaps we could see more of our money being spent to correct  years of economic imbalance. It is a lot to ask for but at least the language is changing. The other thing we need to do is articulate our case better. Often what is dismissed as Derry crying is in actual fact public representatives trying to do the job they were elected to do. Clearly a lot of positive things are happening in the city. The A road in well on track and we also got a new Transport Hub in the Waterside. Ebrington is flying with the potential for thousands of new jobs onsite, however all of this barely scratches the surface of the huge problems Derry has. I want my public representatives to fight for Derry and challenge when we dont get our fair share. I want them to not only compare how we get short changed but also to put clear coated proposals forward for how we redress the imbalance. Its only by putting forward new ideas and plans that we will break the cycle. A recently launched document given to me by Martina Anderson MLA really caught my eye. Titled Tackling Regional Inequality, it goes to the heart of the problem. Not only does it summarise the huge levels of inequality that exist in Derry but it also offers some very workable solutions. I believe current policies are not working for Derry so we have to challenge the normal way of doing this and change it up. This document does this in a few key areas. A few of the key actions that I particularly liked were: . Transforming Invest NI: The document argues that Invest NI needs mandated to channel support away from Belfast and more to areas where it is required. This is in line with the Executives commitment to Tackling Regional Inequalities. Its a brave move but the right move. It also wants a transformation of the roles and s of Invest NI. . Establishment of a Job Steering Unit in Councils:Councils should definitely work more on this area. I believe they should be definitely tallying the numbers of new jobs being created in their region and where it is falling short taking the appropriate action. I also agree they should have more of a role in FDI message and targeting. . Supporting the North West as an Economic Region:I agree fully with this. Derry Donegal is a much easier sell for FDI. Its crazy that businesses in each side of the border have dferent levels of support. We need to work together and grow together. The Irish Government should be a willing partner. . Department of Communities and Economy should establish an employability programme for long term unemployed .This worked well before and should be rolled out again. People are our greatest asset and getting people into meaningful employment should be everyones goal.   Directing Employment through Public Sector Interventions:I am a huge fan of this initiative. The NI Executive spends poundbn a year and capturing a fraction of this for the Social Economy sector is not only good business but improves community cohesion. Putting social clauses into Public Sector contracts and ensuring that winning tenders must demonstrate a positive social value impact is a fantastic idea. Covid has seen communities pull together. Quite often contracts are awarded solely on price with no acknowledgement given to the social capital a company expends. In a post-Covid world, we need to support organisations who deliver quality services at a competitive price but also who provide huge amounts of social impact. The document is fresh and rather than bash government it offers a way forward with many innovative ideas. The Buy Social element is already being implemented so lets watch this space and hopefully it will create more local jobs and community cohesion. In closing, tackling regional inequality is perhaps the biggest thing we can do to reposition Derry as a thriving well connected University City attracting loads of FDI. Galway should be our benchmark in a lot of the areas where we are failing and we shouldnt be afraid to set the bar higher. We have a fantastic product and the problem is we have been starved of the resources we need to make the change happen. With the Executive clearly stating that tackling regional inequality is now a key policy change we need to increase our challengetenfold. The ‘Tackling Regional Inequalities’ document is a really good document with many simple ways of doing this. I suggest you read it and support many of the aims. I hope its the first of many published by local political parties or stakeholders offering ways forward for Derry. Just saying things are broken, doesnt fix them. We need well costed articulated plans.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme is part of an overall pound.M investment in leisure and outdoor recreation facilities across the district by the Council. Work continues at the site to complete the underlying ground works for the new G pitch before the specialist surface is laid. A visible transformation has already taken place on the site of the former police station adjacent to the existing leisure centre, with the removal of the boundary walls and opening up of the site. googletag.cmd.push Funding for this project was approved through Mid Ulster Rural Development Partnership under its Village Renewal Scheme, part-funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme  –  by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, and the European Union, with the remainder of the investment from Mid Ulster District Council. Chair of the Council’s Planning Committee, Councillor Seacutean McPeake, said the timing of the approval was important. “From a planning perspective, this decision illustrates how planning has such a vital role in supporting the vision of our Community Plan to create a region which is a welcoming place, where our people are content, healthy and safe, he said. googletag.cmd.push This focus has never been more important than now, when taking care of our health and well-being has come to the fore for each and every one of us.” Chair of Mid Ulster Rural Development Partnership, Conor Corr said the development would have a signicant impact. “This is one of a number of strategic projects supported under the Partnership’s Village Renewal Scheme, he said. Having provided % of the funding from our enhanced budget of pound.m of EU LEADER funding for village renewal projects, this scheme will also have signicant local impact by addressing some of the key issues identied by those who live in Maghera.     Having that local input and consultation has been a key factor in making projects such as this both successful and sustainable”. Extended car parking, landscaping, a new trim trail and an all-inclusive play area will complete the project when works finish in the spring and it is hoped that access to the pitch will be made available following the lting of current Covid- restrictions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans involved the construction of  houses at a riverside site at Rossbay off the Limavady Road. Residents in the area had raised a large number of concerns in relation to the plans, including road safety and congestion issues. The plans were first submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning department in . They involved the proposed construction of  houses and eight bungalows on the land overlooking the River Foyle. After detailed examinations, the councils planning department recommended that the plans be approved. googletag.cmd.push However, the final say on planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and there was a y discussion on the plans for the Rossbay site. Representatives for local residents opposed to the development and the company behind the housing plans were given the opportunity to address the meeting. The meeting was told that although  objections had been received in relation to the plans, they involved multiple submissions from  properties in the surrounding area. This was the largest number of objections that the council has ever received in relation to a planning application. googletag.cmd.push After the ious arguments were put forward at todays meeting, DUP councillor Hilary McClintock proposed that the committee go against the recommendation of the councils planning department and refuse permission for the Waterside development. Her proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and supported unanimously by all the councillors who were eligible to vote at the meeting.

I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased. We have known about getting the award for a while before it was actually made public knowledge, so it has been in the pipeline, he remarked.ldquoWe are very proud that what it represents especially is our work with community engagement. That is something we pride ourselves on here at Ballynahinch.ldquoIt is really special to have been awarded the prize this year especially. It has been such a tough year, for everyone, and for all sports clubs. It is certainly a nice little boost that we have been able to get this.James said the club was concentrating on getting the green light for action on the pitch to .ldquoThat is what everyone wants and what everyone is missing. To not be able to get playing is dficult, but of course we absolutely recognise why it is the case. Public health is of paramount importance.Ballynahinch RFC usually fields seven adult teams, as well as youth teams, a ladiesrsquo team and a thriving mini rugby section.ldquoThere has been no action at the club since October. New showers, installed at a cost of pound,, have not been used, James explained.He said that before the current lockdown members were able to use their free time to make improvements around the club.ldquoWe obviously donrsquot have that at the moment, due to the current restrictions, he continued.ldquoIt was great to see how the people benefited from it. They certainly did seem to have their spirits lted. Our volunteers are a hugely important part of the club, and that has had to be stopped too.ldquoHopefully things do improve soon, but I guess we are like everyone and just have to wait and see how things develop with coronavirus.Sinead Kissane, chairperson of the Rugby Writers of Ireland, said: ldquo was a very challenging year for all, but it is also important to recognise the work and achievements of many during this dficult time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-BidBirdwatch.jpg","title":"Bid for help in the Big Garden Birdwatch event this weekend  ","story":"PEOPLE across the district are being encouraged to take part in the RSPBrsquos annual Big Garden Birdwatch, which takes place this weekend.The UK-wide event is the worldrsquos largest garden wildle survey with locals asked to help from this Friday to Sunday.For many people, garden birds provide an important connection to nature and bring joy and comfort, as well as being vital for mental health and wellbeing, with the RSPB hoping for a big response to the weekend survey.RSPB NI, a charity that works to inspire everyone to give nature a home and to secure a healthy environment for wildle, is hoping that more people than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.The charity said that over the past year, itrsquos been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyonersquos mental health and wellbeing.In addition, the RSPB says there has been a surge in interest in the nature on peoplersquos doorsteps, with many coming to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times.People keen on taking part in the birdwatch are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden before sending their results to the RSPB.Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK, with just under , of them from Northern Ireland.Anne-Marie McDevitt, the RSPB NIrsquos head of species, said with more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and, as a result, have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.ldquoLast year, people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but itrsquos not that there has been more wildle about itrsquos just that wersquove had more time and space to notice it, she explained.ldquoBy taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives. Paying them would allow them to be able to support themselves.ldquoI am calling on the health minister to pay these nurses and to also increase the student nurse bursary as a recognition of the fantastic work student nurses are doing in the fight against Covid-..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 24%2C 2001  ","story":"KILLINCHY ndash The owners of a Killinchy factory, which could close its doors with the loss of  jobs, have this week been accused of playing mind games with staff.Trade union officials and shop stewards are furious with the owners of the Carpets International plant for their continued refusal to come clean about its future.And at a time when staff are unsuretheir jobs are secure, they have been asked by their bosses to increase their weekly productivity.A crucial board meeting planned for Bradford last week to discuss the Killinchy plantrsquos future role was cancelled at the eleventh hour and company officials have been accused of ldquohiding behind a wall of silence.More than  of the staff employed in Killinchy live in Down District and they believe their jobs could be on the line as the plantrsquos American owners press ahead with a major restructuring plan which will result in a number of its factories being downsized and closed.Workers fear the local plant will be axed in a bid to save costs amid claims that the parent company is poundm in debt.

He has performed the role of club chairman, with his playing reduced to part-time due to the fact he suffers from arthritis in a finger.He has played for Drumaroad in the past, and in more recent seasons for the former top club in Downpatrick, De La Salle.Back in the days of the Lecale Leaguersquos Spin magazine, which was edited by the late and sadly-missed Gerry Carson, Jim provided lsquoPeople in the Newsrsquo and lsquoAt your Servicersquo on a regular basis.This was back in the late s. Starting in  he produced another magazine named Equipment Plus.At this stage, he was running his Table Tennis Servicesfrom his home in Castlewellan. However, as many will recall, for some years he ran Northern Irelandrsquos only table tennis shop in Irish Street, Downpatrick. He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years.

Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world.

In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet.

That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who

Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was

Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been cancelled for the second year in a row.She said the March  events were normally an opportunity to celebrate the districtrsquos connection with St Patrick and the arearsquos important place in his the patron saintrsquos story.ldquoI know how disappointed many will be about this decision and I share their disappointment, said Cllr Devlin. ldquoHowever, the councilrsquos priority at this time is to continue to support the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic across wider society.She said that the decision to cancel was made in the best interests of residents, visitors, festival participants and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said they were looking forward to the  event going ahead.They said the local authority had to act to avoid any needless delay, warning that there was no way any festival parade could take place in the current Covid climate.Cllr Clarke said people needed to know that the parade would not happen, highlighting the continuing importance of protecting peoplersquos health.Cllr Curran said the event could not possibly have proceeded, given the ongoing public health emergency.He said the Covid situation remained ldquoextremely serious and that news of the parade cancellation would not come as a surprise.Cllr Walker urged council officials not to wait until the ldquoeleventh hour to pull the plug on the parade and hoped that next yearrsquos event will be one of the best ever.Cllr Burgess said current public health advice was clear, which meant the local council had no option but to cancel the parade, and urged council officials to start preparations for next yearrsquos event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Views.jpg","title":"Views sought on play park upgrade  ","story":"NEWCASTLE residents are being encouraged to have

Those of us who signed this declaration and pledge were described by fellow unionists, church leaders, business leaders, the great and the good etc as dinosaurs, anti peace and peace wreckers.It is worth re-stating this declaration:   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“We, the United Pro-Union people of Northern Ireland, declare our resolute and determined opposition to the Belfast Agreement.“We reject the abandonment of the United Kingdom’s sovereignty over Northern Ireland in exchange for an amendment of the Irish Constitution that renders Unionists a mere tradition in the Irish nation.“We repudiate all-Ireland bodies with executive powers and expanding authority designed to develop into a factually United Ireland. “We demand, as British citizens, equality of treatment, the protection of our lives, persons and property, and theof a democratic and accountable government, free from the domination of violent political terrorism, and in which all citizens have equal rights.“We solemnly pledge ourselves and urge our fellow citizens to ensure, by every lawful means, the rejection of an Agreement designed to destroy the Union.”It should now be clear to every unionist that the Belfast Agreement is designed to destroy the Union and create the institutions of an all Ireland state. Regrettably some unionists are still sleep walking in to this trap despite warning after warning. It is galling that the DUP who played a key role in the United Unionist campaign are the very party who are implementing the Belfast Agreement for their own political expediency.This is the same party whose MLAs meekly followed one by one in to the voting lobbies to endorse Sinn Fein’s Alex Maskey as the Assembly Speaker when they had the alternative of voting a unionist Roy Beggs Jr.It is particularly shocking to see a DUP minister’s officials implementing customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The Belfast Agreement has delivered nothing for unionism whilst nationalism continues to bank concession after concession as a direct result of its outworkings assisted by naive or career unionists.The only option left now for unionism is to defend the Union by bringing the nefarious Belfast Agreement and its structures to an end.Norman Boyd, Former Anti Agreement Unionist MLA——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Letter to the editorLike the News Letter I question why it was so long in coming. Like the News Letter I question what exactly it means in important respects.Do the DUP now accept that they were wrong to vote in favour of legislation which banned British soil from Northern Ireland  Are they pledging not to repeat such folly in the future What do the DUP mean when they say North-South relations are “impacted”  Will the North South arrangements of the Belfast Agreement be suspended until such times as the protocol is gone  That sort of action is likely to make people sit up and take notice. Signing an e-petition is not.Yesterday in the assembly DUP Agriculture Minister Gordon Lyons told me that it was his understanding thathis department declines to operate the checks no one  can. Here too is an obvious point of pressure.The News Letter quite rightly asks why safeguards were not secured in January last year as part of the deal to restore Stormont. One could go on to ask why the DUP leader signed a joint letter with Martin McGuinness in  asking for Northern Ireland to be treated dferently. Or why in  the DUP accepted a regulatory border in the Irish Sea.So mistakes have been made. It is far from clear to me, or wider unionism, that that has been recognised or what exactly the DUP plan going forward is.However,the DUP are serious about getting rid of the protocol — not getting longer lead in periods or derogations — and are prepared to take the robust, sustained political action which is necessary they will not find my support wanting.What does robust, sustained political action look like  It means unionist involvement in the Belfast Agreement North South arrangements is frozen. It means unionists will veto all EU laws and never again permit them to be adopted by the assembly. It means that the agriculture minister will not have his officials back operating the Irish Sea border.If all that is done then unionism can say that it did all it could to disrupt a pernicious protocol which is cyanide to the Union. If, however, this becomes another ‘graduated response’ then I am afraid it falls far short from the effort needed to defeat the most serious threat to Northern Ireland’s constitutional positon in my letime.Jim Allister QC, North Antrim MLA, Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Part of their new multi-disciplinary model is still in place - where not just GPs are working under the same roof, but pharmacists and physios too. But rather than them coming to the surgery initially, it is via telephone.Dr Kristina Leppik, Dr Quarratul-Ain Yousef, Mrs Kerry Anne-CarterIf it is apparent from the call that they need to come in for a face-to-face, that will be organised. Those that are called in, must follow a one-way-system through the surgery and will have their temperature taken upon arrival.Dr Kristina Leppik, who works at the surgery, said she was apprehensive about this new way of working at first, wonderingGPs would be able to assess patients properly over the phone. But due to prior training in telephone consultations, the transition was smooth and easier than initially thought.On Monday, December , work began on rolling out the Oxford AZ vaccine in the area to patients over . Staff had to make sure that everyone was ready and prepared for this important task, and even took into consideration those that have worries about entering a GP now.Dr Quarratul-Ain Yousef, who moved to the area from Birmingham not long before lockdown began, said the staff have been ldquoquite proactive in trying to adapt by creating an outside pod with a clear shelter ndash which cannot be seen through easily - where people coming in for a vaccine or routine B jab can have it done rather than going insidethey choose.ldquoWersquove reduced risk to our staff, the patients coming in, and reduced risks to patients.ldquoThe initial reason for the shelter was because we thought, well, winter is coming, and people are going to have coughs.ldquoWe might need to listen to them, and instead of bringing them in, how do we assess such a high risk in a safe and confidential manner ldquoWe give them the option, and most people have been fine. And itrsquos been quite nice to feel a bit more relaxed because itrsquos an open environment.As soon as the staff are aware of the amount of stock that they will be getting from the health board, they can organise the clinics.ldquoWe have to factor in the spacing, itrsquos a new vaccine so people might have questions which we are always happy to answer.ldquoSo far itrsquos going pretty well.

We did not have to be escorted out of the building as some reports have suggested.\"What we did was to have some alcohol with a meal we heated up in a microwave, which was a couple of glasses of wine on the Tuesday and a beer on the Wednesday. I broke no actual Covid- regulations.ldquoFor the last  months of the pandemic, I have followed the Covid- regulations to the letter. As with everyone across Wales, I have not seen family members or friends, Irsquove not eaten at my favourite restaurants and, like you, we enjoyed a subdued Christmas compared to other years. I will continue to follow the Welsh Governmentrsquos Covid- Regulations and I would urge everyone to play their part in defeating this virus so that we can allto normality.ldquoMy priority as Leader of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Welsh Parliament has always been to bring the Conservatives into government in Wales. Our main focus as the Welsh Conservatives must always be on challenging and removing a failing Labour government.ldquoI am grateful for the support of colleagues in the Welsh Conservative Party for their support in this dficult time, and especially to my we Julie and my Senedd colleagues who have offered empathy, trust and advice. They have treated me with the same courtesy and decency I hope I have always extended to others.ldquoOver the last couple of days, I have been speaking with colleagues in the Senedd and the wider Conservative Party. Whilst they have confirmed they do not wish to see me step down, I believe that my actions are becoming a distraction from holding this failing Welsh Labour-led Government to account, not just on their roll out of the Covid- vaccines but from more than  years of their dither, delay and failure.\"Yesterday I indicated to the Conservative group in the Welsh Parliament that I wished to resign, but they urged me to reflect further, and we agreed to meet again on Monday. However, for the sake of my party, my health and my own conscience, I simply cannot continue in post.ldquoTherefore, I am stepping down as Leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Parliament with immediate effect.ldquoIt is for the group to decide how best to choose a new leader, but I hope that process will be seamless and speedy, and I pledge my support to whoever becomes leader.Mr Millar - MS for Clwyd West - also issued a statement, referring to \"a dficult week\".ldquoI want to apologise to my family, colleagues and constituents for any embarrassment that some of the media stories may have caused in recent days,\" he said.ldquoThere have been some wildly inaccurate and unfair reports so I want to set out the truth.\"As has been the case in most weeks since September when the Hybrid Senedd was sitting in Cardf Bay, on both the th and th December last year I used the self-serve catering arrangements that were made available for Senedd Members. On both evenings I served myself a pre-ordered, pre-prepared meal that was reheated in the microwave and ate it while drinking an alcoholic beverage and discussing work matters with colleagues.ldquoSocial distancing was maintained throughout these working dinners and it simply did not occur to either me, my colleagues or the catering team that the arrangements may have been inappropriate.ldquoThere was a member of catering staff present in the tea room for a short time after my arrival on the th December but she did not serve me a drink, nor did I request one. In fact, I encouraged the member of staff to go home and close up the counter as it had been a long day for her. No members of catering staff were present on the th December and the counter was closed for the whole evening.ldquoWhile I am advised that I did not breach coronavirus regulations I am very sorry for my actions, especially given the impact of the tough restrictions that people and businesses are enduring.ldquoFor this reason, and given that Paul Davies has resigned as Welsh Conservative Group Leader in the Senedd, I have decided to step down from my front bench role in the Welsh Parliament.ldquoI am cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and will continue to do so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Welsh Government is due to review the restrictions this week, with first minister Mark Drakeford announcing the outcome of this on Friday.But Mr Gething said although there was ldquogood news in reduced transmission rates and declining hospital admission rates, coronavirus still poses a ldquosignicant risk in Wales.:ldquoWe look at all of the dferent matters available to us, but, as I said last week, no one should expect a signicant unlocking of the current lockdown measures, he said. ldquoThey are what are keeping us safe, it is helping to drive down the overall transmission rate ndash wersquore now at just under  cases per , for the figures just released today.ldquoNow thats good news to see it coming down but theres still quite a high level of coronavirus circulating, and our positivity rate is still well above the  per cent mark to consider moving beyond that, as well as the fact that our NHS is still under lots and lots of pressure.ldquoIn our hospitals, even though were seeing a decline in admission rates, our critical care units are now operating at still about  per cent of their normal capacity.ldquoTheres a range of dferent things to consider and I hope people will be patient and still do the right thing and recognise that there is still a signicant risk to all of us. We have to do the right thing, which may mean that our measures have to be extended for some time to come, but no one should expect a signicant change in the arrangements or a signicant easing of those arrangements at the end of this week.The health minister was also asked about reports the lockdown restrictions may be eased in England, and whether a four-nation approach to easing the lockdown would be preferred.ldquoIts helpful for us to discuss these matters sensibly with each other, he said. ldquoThere is now much more regular engagement between the four governments, thatrsquos with the first ministers are meeting together with Michael Gove for the UK Government.ldquoWe havent had that direct engagement between the first ministers of not just Wales but also Scotland, Northern Ireland and Boris Johnson as prime minister, I think that would help us to do so.ldquoI hope that as it becomes a more real possibility will be able to have a grown up and constructive conversation between all four governments in the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

We have to do the right thing, which may mean that our measures have to be extended for some time to come, but no one should expect a signicant change in the arrangements or a signicant easing of those arrangements at the end of this week.The health minister was also asked about reports the lockdown restrictions may be eased in England, and whether a four-nation approach to easing the lockdown would be preferred.ldquoIts helpful for us to discuss these matters sensibly with each other, he said. ldquoThere is now much more regular engagement between the four governments, thatrsquos with the first ministers are meeting together with Michael Gove for the UK Government.ldquoWe havent had that direct engagement between the first ministers of not just Wales but also Scotland, Northern Ireland and Boris Johnson as prime minister, I think that would help us to do so.ldquoI hope that as it becomes a more real possibility will be able to have a grown up and constructive conversation between all four governments in the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCBI Wales is urging the Welsh Government to work closely with businesses to identy economy-critical elements to the process.In a letter to economy and transport minister Ken Skates, signed jointly by CBI director-general Tony Danker and Wales director Ian Price, the CBI has identied a series of key priorities to plan for a successful re-opening of the economy when the moment is right to do so.The CBI picked out six areas that would help businesses in Wales plan for a lting of restrictions.They ask the Welsh Government to:Confirm what will be considered low, medium or high-risk economic activity, so that businesses can understand what will open sooner or later.Decide whether or not there will be ato alert levels, as part of a gradual re-opening. Andso, what will now be permitted under each level as more people become vaccinated.Identy and understand the conditions that need to be met before rolling back certain restrictions, and ultimately the need for social distancing.Outline how the vaccine will be deployed once the most vulnerable groups are inoculated, to reach the governmentrsquos target of all UK adults being offered a vaccine by autumn.Think how regular mass rapid testing in the community and workplaces could allow a wider, speedier reopening of the economy.Create bespoke, detailed plans for the harder to open sectors of the economy, such as testing regimes for international travel, or the conditions for activities such as hospitality and live events to .Running alongside the roadmap there must be clear parameters for determining what, and for how long, economic support measures remain in place, the CBI say.:Mr Price said: ldquoThe prime minister has set out the initial parameters for reopening as a country, which was a big help for businesses.\"Clearly, the precise dates will be determined by data, so letrsquos use this time wisely to get the roadmap right together for when lockdown ends.ldquoThere is huge appetite among businesses to help the Welsh Government create and deliver a roadmap out of lockdown that lasts, has national consensus and kickstarts our economic recovery as  unfolds.ldquoA common framework with devolved administrations must also be possible and help to minimise dferences in approach, and we will work closely with the Welsh Government to help promote that consistency.ldquoBusinesses are currently completely in the dark when planning for the weeks and months ahead and this is hindering investment. We can provide more clarity and do the prep work now to enable them to plan for reopening and growth.ldquoItrsquos clear that we will be entering a new normal even post-vaccination. We will have new workplace, testing and economic realities to live with.ldquoWersquove all learnt a lot in  about what reopening looks like so letrsquos move now to a plan for  that is detailed, practical and instils confidence. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In total the boys raised a whopping £, for charity. leave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" data-s-urlclick\" news people liverpool-and-manchester-united-fans-aged--leave-rivalry-behind-run-charity-marathon-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\"Liverpool and Manchester United fansleave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"  \"    leave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" data-s-urlclick\" news people liverpool-and-manchester-united-fans-aged--leave-rivalry-behind-run-charity-marathon-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"   leave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" data-s-urlclick\" news people liverpool-and-manchester-united-fans-aged--leave-rivalry-behind-run-charity-marathon-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\"Liverpool and Manchester United fansleave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"   leave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" data-s-urlclick\" news people liverpool-and-manchester-united-fans-aged--leave-rivalry-behind-run-charity-marathon-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Whatsapp\" data-param-text\"Liverpool and Manchester United fansleave rivalry behind to run charity marathon https:www.portadowntimes news people liverpool-and-manchester-united-fans-aged--leave-rivalry-behind-run-charity-marathon-\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\"  Most PopularFrom Lismore to Liverpool FC, Liam Hughes ‘had courage to follow his dreams’Tributes to ‘highly esteemed’ Drumcree Orangeman Darryl HewittPark le at Edenvilla is set for a major boostDeath of teenage girl described as ‘an unspeakable loss’Death toll in NI rises to , as  people fight COVID- in our hospitalsMost Popular leave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people liverpool-and-manchester-united-fans-aged--leave-rivalry-behind-run-charity-marathon- itm_sourceparsely-api\" leave rivalry behind to run charity marathon\"Liverpool and Manchester United fansleave rivalry behind to run charity marathonTribute to ‘inspirational’ Portadown College teacher Des JohnstonAppeal after two vehicle crash in PortadownSecond Orange Order district goes public over Irish Sea border ‘betrayal’Man taken to hospital after serious crash                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-feJyhm sc-iELTvK cSgooN\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"these bridgerton inspired baby names are predicted be popular february ","story":"Man taken to hospital after serious crash   Tributes to ‘highly esteemed’ Drumcree Orangeman Darryl HewittNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesNewsPeople\"Which name would you choose  These Bridgerton-inspired baby names are predicted to be popular in FebruaryWhen picking out a name for your little one, inspiration can come from many places - from relatives and friends, to popular culture.By Claire SchofieldThursday, th January , : pmUpdated Thursday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Experts from Datingroo have predicted that new parents will look to popular culture when selecting a moniker this year, with the likes of politicians, celebrities and TV shows helping to inspire choices.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The earlier statement from Markethill also includes a reference to DUP minister Edwin Poots which is not included in the Portadown District’s statement on social media.\"Portadown District colour party with Drumcree church in the background. Picture: Freddie Parkinson Press EyeIt states: “The [Markethill] district further call on our fellow brother Orangeman, Edwin Poots, the Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to immediately stop officials within his department from implementing the Irish Sea border checks.”In its response, Portadown District said: “The NI Protocol is an act of betrayal of the unionist community and our position as a sovereign part of the United Kingdom.“Portadown District is well aware of those elected politicians who voted for the Irish Sea Border, now is the time for you to apologise for your past actions and to pledge to do all that you can to bring it down, eventhat means disobeying your political leaders.”The statement goes on to call for “all unionist parties to take all necessary action to veto the implementation of EU laws through the Stormont Assembly”.\"DUP MLA William IrwinThe Markethill District comprises  lodges with a combined membership of more than .William Irwin posted his own response to the Markethill statement, describing the claim he supported the Irish Sea border as “untrue”. He said: “As an Orangeman of some  years, in the district of Loughgall... I am very disappointed by Markethill District Orange No ’s untrue claim. “I am absolutely at one with the many thousands of unionists across Northern Ireland who find the imposition of this protocol and its outworkings offensive and running contrary to everything we stand for,” he said.“I did not vote for the protocol nor have I supported it. To suggest otherwise is wrong, disingenuous and it would appear politically motivated.”Although the overwhelming majority of comments were supportive of the Markethill position, one reply said: “I was stunned to read the alleged Markethill District statement, andit is authenticated, they have seriously breached protocol for one and the duty of an Orangeman. I sincerely hope a retraction is publicly published andnot Grand Lodge need to step in.”In response to the latest Portadown District statement, one member said: “As much as I welcome this as an Orangeman, and it’s great to see, the only problem is it won’t make a dference until Grand Lodge publicly make the same statement to which I cant see them doing. I hope I’m proved wrong.”The Grand Lodge of Ireland has not yet responded to a request for comment.READ: Orange Order heartland rocked by bitter row over Irish Sea borderREAD: Lodge breaks ranks with Orange Order over New Decade New Approach dealA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

In line with the Department of Health’s twin track approach to accelerate vaccinations, both the online system and telephone booking line can be used by those in the - age group to make an appointment at one of the seven regional vaccination centres. While demand for vaccination slots is high, people are reminded that there will be enough appointments for everyone in the group so please remain patient. In the last five days the online booking system has been used to make , appointments. People are asked to reserve capacity on the telephone booking linefor those who cannot avail of the online booking facility. Where possible we would encourage booking appointments online. It is also anticipated that demand for telephone bookings will initially be very high. Therefore,you cannot get through initially, please be patient and try again later. Call volumes tend to be lower later in the day. If you can’t get through immediately then try again. The service is available from Monday to Friday .am to .pm. To fall within the - age bracket you must have been born between  April  and  March . Age and identity checks will be conducted at the vaccination centres. People outside the relevant age group should not misuse the online or telephone booking facility. Misuse will only make it more dficult for those to get through who are being prioritised because of their clinical vulnerability. GPs will be working in parallel to the regional vaccination centres and will focus on the  plus age group. This group cannot use this booking facility. GPs will make contact with their patients in this age group, therefore people do not need to phone their GP practice. This twin track approach announced by the Department of Health last week will help accelerate NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfddcddeedc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfbbbbda   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
