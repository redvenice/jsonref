Though he has yet to lay out his worldview or political platform, he flaunts stellar military credentials - a must in security-centric Israel - and a squeaky-clean image to contrast Netanyahu\u0027s corruption-laden reputation.Although still short of the kind of widespread support likely needed to become prime minister, Gantz\u0027s candidacy captures a yearning in Israel for a viable alternative to emerge against the long-serving Netanyahu, who has been in office for nearly a decade and is seeking a fourth consecutive term.With a commanding lead in the polls, and a potential indictment looming against him, Netanyahu called early elections this week, seeking to pre-empt possible corruption charges and return to office to become the longest serving premier in Israeli history.\u0027It\u0027s worse than a North Korean prison\u0027: Dundee United fan...Trump CANCELS his favorite trip to celebrate New Year\u0027s Eve...Share this articlePolice have recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery and breach of trust in three different cases. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the allegations as a media-orchestrated witch hunt aimed at removing him from office.Israel\u0027s attorney general is now weighing whether to file criminal charges. Analysts say that Netanyahu hopes to win re-election before a decision is made, believing it would be much more difficult for the attorney general to charge a popular, newly elected leader.Even with Netanyahu\u0027s legal woes, he remains popular in opinion polls, while Israel\u0027s established opposition remains splintered and unable to produce a viable challenger.  On Thursday, Gantz said he is running for office in the April 9 elections and registered his new party, \u0027Israel Resilience\u0027Like most retired security officials, Gantz is believed to hold moderate positions toward the Palestinians, which would set him apart from Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the issue while focusing on Iran\u0027s influence in the region. But Gantz has been cagey about voicing his opinions, wary of alienating conservative voters crucial for a political upheaval.Early opinion polls indicate that Gantz would take away votes from all the major parties and may not tip the scales away from Netanyahu just yet. But the emergence of the tall, telegenic ex-general with salty hair makes things more interesting, as he could spark new alliances with other moderate parties to give the hard-line Likud an honest fight.\u0027It\u0027s too early to tell, but he definitely strengthens the center-left camp,\u0027 said Mina Tzemach, a leading Israeli pollster, whose most recent survey gave Gantz\u0027s new party as many as 16 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. \u0027He projects security and integrity. And the fact that he looks good doesn\u0027t hurt either.\u0027Gantz, 59, was a paratrooper who rose up the ranks to head special operations units and other various commands before serving as military attache to the United States and ultimately becoming Israel\u0027s 20th military chief between 2011-2015. His term was marked by two wars with Hamas militants in Gaza and a covert air campaign in Syria against Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.  Like most retired security officials, Gantz is believed to hold moderate positions toward the Palestinians, which would set him apart from NetanyahuSince his discharge, he has been aggressively courted by several Israeli political parties, but ultimately decided to go it alone for now as the leader of his own party.Despite his impressive pedigree, Gantz remains a political unknown, which explains part of his appeal in such a highly partisan climate.\u0027There seems to be about 20 percent of the public that is fed up with what\u0027s out there. He appeals to those who don\u0027t want Netanyahu but can\u0027t bring themselves to vote for the others either,\u0027 said Reuven Hazan, a political science professor at Jerusalem\u0027s Hebrew University. \u0027He\u0027s the flavor of the election.\u0027          Police have recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery and breach of trust in three different cases. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoingIsrael is no stranger to such would-be saviors. In the 2013 elections, former TV anchor Yair Lapid came out of nowhere with his centrist Yesh Atid party to capture 19 seats and become Israel\u0027s second-largest faction. Last time, in 2015, Moshe Kahlon\u0027s economy-focused Kulanu became the unlikely kingmaker. Both, however, decided to join Netanyahu\u0027s coalition rather than oppose him and their years in the system have taken off some of the shine since then.Polls currently reflect a dichotomy in which most Israelis don\u0027t want Netanyahu to continue to be their prime minister while simultaneously saying they see no preferred candidate to replace him. To finally topple Netanyahu, Gantz will likely have to team up with a combination of Lapid, Kahlon, the venerable Labor Party and others. Opposition leader Tzipi Livni has called on the various candidates to \u0027put their egos aside\u0027 and unite against Netanyahu."},{"url":null,"title":"Neil Kinnock demanded spec Rover official car","story":"    Neil Kinnock (pictured in 1988) rejected the two-litre model he was due to receive, with aides saying it was unlikely to cope with his schedule of barrelling around the countryIn 1988, Kinnock, who led the Labour Party until 1992, had been due to receive a Rover 820SE, in line with Cabinet ministers.But documents released by the National Archives show Kinnock\u0027s aide Sue Nye writing to the Government Car Service to question whether the chosen model would be \u0027satisfactory\u0027.\u0027The IRA intend to continue their strategy of terrorism and...Spam fritter making and sandcastle building: Fury at John...How Margaret Thatcher’s attorney general awoke from surgery...\u0027Your people come over to us, I wish they wouldn\u0027t\u0027:...Share this article\u0027As you will be aware, Mr Kinnock travels a great deal on motorways where a more powerful engine is, of course, necessary\u0027, she wrote.\u0027I would therefore be grateful if you could investigate the possibility of the new Rover 820 having a more powerful engine.\u0027          Mrs Thatcher approved the more powerful Rover 825-i (pictured), but wrote: \u0027In us meeting his request, I hope you will point out that some Cabinet ministers do similar mileage\u0027Mrs Thatcher was asked to make a final decision and was informed that in nine months Kinnock \u0027had clocked up 14,500 miles\u0027.She approved the more powerful Rover 825-i, but wrote: \u0027In us meeting his request, I hope you will point out that some Cabinet ministers do similar mileage.\u0027Mrs Thatcher could have been referring obliquely to herself. Documents released earlier this year recounted how the PM\u0027s hectic schedule meant she frequently took catnaps while on the road."},{"url":null,"title":"The day Maggie turned football pundit PM praised Englands vanquished Italia 90 team","story":"    Mrs Thatcher (pictured with Gascoigne at Downing Street) herself took the opportunity to pay homage to the England football squad - and congratulate them for not ingMrs Thatcher said after their arrival. \u0027This is the furthest an England team has ever gone in this tournament on foreign soil.\u0027And you gave the world what were, by universal acclaim, the best matches of the tournament to watch.Mother, 37, arrested on suspicion of murder after her two...Share this article\u0027Yours was a superb example of a group working supremely well together as a team, allowing each at the right moment to show that flash of inspiration and flair that makes football so enjoyable to see.\u0027According to the previously unseen speaking notes, the PM then turned to punditry, telling the players: \u0027Football is inevitably a tough and physical game, and even with the best will, where players are striving keenly in competition, they can clash in trying to be first to the ball.

Sue says:Initially, I started off doing two hours\u0027 volunteering a week, but once the League of Friends Committee heard about my accountancy skills they asked me to become treasurer. I\u0027m very proud that the shop made £67,000 last year, all of which was spent on hospital equipment.I\u0027ve made some very good friends here including Maureen. We\u0027re very proud of our contribution to the NHS.   We could chat all day Lorraine Pegg, 65, a retired customer services manager, lives in Glamorgan, Wales, and began volunteering as a trolley lady at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital three months ago. Both she and late husband Clive were treated there. She says:The Royal Glam, as I call it, is a really special hospital for me – the care we received there was outstanding.I go in on a Monday morning for four hours – my friend Paul and I go to the wards selling newspapers, magazines, puzzle books, cold drinks, toiletries and healthy snacks. We must cover several miles a day. I think it\u0027s chatting to the patients I like the most – I could stand there and talk all day, whether it\u0027s about Strictly or families and holidays.Volunteering has done wonders for my confidence and it puts life in perspective – when I think \u0027poor me\u0027, I realise there are lots of people worse off and I go home wondering what I was whingeing about.Interviews: Jo Waters      "},{"url":null,"title":"Internet lights memes Queens transformer explosion","story":"    NYC Fire Wire confirmed that a explosion had occurred in the North Queens neighborhood at a Con Edison subplant          The plant explosion occurred around 9.20pm and no injuries have been reported and the fire was quickly contained, according to authorities          Residents who lived near the Con Ed power plant saw the bright blue and white flashes close-up, as it lit up the New York skyline          Rikers Island jail were forced to use backup generators when their electricity shut off for 25 minutes and there were delays on the subway as a result of the fire Forensic officers arrive at the scene of Margate double murderShocking moment Ricaldo Calder kicks and punches woman in road rageNew Year Honours List names a number of famous facesTransgender woman threatens shop employee who called her \u0027sir\u0027Locator Map: Three British tourists die in Iceland bridge crashAram Kurd describes how he escaped the blaze in LeicesterBritish tourists die after their car came off a bridge in IcelandParking rage!

It was just plain. We were just trying to figure out how we could jazz it up and we both love Lego so came up with the idea of building an interactive wall that our friends and family could enjoy along with us.\u0027What began as a \u0027bit of a silly joke\u0027 quickly turned into something bigger.Ms Turford said: \u0027It seemed like quite a small and easy project at first but we massively underestimated how many bricks it took to even complete one line so quickly found ourselves scouting around for more.  Ms Turford and Mr Wilkinson (left) stuffed the wall with quirky characters, secret doors and Lego men (right) \u0027We didn\u0027t plan it. It just happened as we did it row by row. We wanted it to be as natural as possible so tried not to think about the colours we were putting together as we wanted it to stay childlike and naive.\u0027The couple have had several parties this year and were surprised about how enthusiastic people could be about the feature.\u0027It\u0027s a talking point, definitely. It\u0027s massively taken us by surprise how appreciative and enthusiastic people are about it,’ Ms Turford said.          The couple with a box of Lego next to their giant wall \u0027I really thought people would just see it as a wall of bricks and funky bits on it but people genuinely think it\u0027s a brilliant creation.\u0027You just don\u0027t think that many people are going to appreciate something you\u0027ve done so it is very humbling.\u0027Especially when it\u0027s a personal thing and it\u0027s a project you\u0027ve done yourself and put out there. It\u0027s gone a bit bonkers.\u0027The couple sought out the thousands of bricks used in the wall at car boot sales, auction houses and through online sellers - but became frustrated at how quickly they got through them.They say they have no idea how much they spent in total - but gave an estimate of a couple of thousand pounds.And in true Lego spirit, the couple think their creation is \u0027awesome\u0027 and routinely sing the Lego theme song \u0027Everything is Awesome\u0027.Ms Turford said: \u0027I love it all. I love the men in little holes.

Now they are man and wife having flown to Las Vegas to get married by an Elvis impersonator during their first dateThe pair were matched by a dating app on December 15 and just nine days later, on Christmas Eve, Sarah was sweeping into departures at Gatwick in a designer bridal gown hastily bought on eBay for £100, after a series of intense exchanged messages and phone calls with Paul.Nerves calmed by a quick pint, the groom, wearing a new £271 three-piece suit from Moss Bros, dropped to one knee at check-in and presented his bride-to-be with a vintage £800 diamond cluster engagement ring, watch and bouquet before jetting off to the U.S.Female paedophile, 25, who worked in Great Ormond Street’s...Share this articleSuch was their enthusiasm, only another drone attack could have prevented their arrival in Vegas, where they were married that evening by ‘mobile minister’ Roland August in an outdoor ceremony in front of the fountains of the Bellagio hotel.They kissed for the very first time after being legally declared man and wife, and consummated their marriage that night.Their honeymoon is now a crash course in ‘getting to know you’, including such finer details as Sarah’s love of mayonnaise and Paul’s favourite colour (baby blue).          The couple have denied their rapid relationship is part of a publicity stunt  claiming they are two ordinary people who are both looking for serious and lasting loveGiven that others who have married at first sight — usually as part of a tacky TV experiment — ended up bitterly regretting it, you’d think the odds were surely against them in the long term, despite their euphoria over what Sarah describes as ‘the happiest day of my life’.So is this a crazy publicity stunt or are the pair of them plain crazy?They insist the answer is neither that they are two ordinary people looking for serious, lasting love who reckon this is the best way to secure it.‘If someone had told me I’d end up marrying someone I’d never even met before, I would never have believed them,’ says Paul, who concedes that his shocked family and friends thought he was ‘bonkers’ when he told them.‘There were a few moments when I got cold feet but now I think it’s the best thing I’ve ever done.’          Paul Edwards, right, got down on one knee on Christmas Eve in departures at Gatwick Airport to propose with Sarah Elliott, who he had only \u0027met\u0027 on the dating app Bumble nine days earlierAs for Sarah, she is convinced their marriage will last the distance and is looking forward to telling their future children the remarkable story of their courtship — or rather, lack of it.For even the new Mr and Mrs Edwards, now the most famous newlyweds in Britain following widespread publicity, admit the word ‘whirlwind’ barely does justice to their relationship.After what they describe as ‘hundreds’ of hours of phone conversations in less than a fortnight, they decided to skip the dating stage and tie the knot, despite never having met.Sarah wasn’t even sure what her intended husband looked like because when they Skyped he was sitting in a poorly lit room, but was relieved to discover he was ‘very handsome’ in the flesh.          Paul handed Sarah and antique £800 engagement ring before they boarded their flight ‘Paul suggested I look at his Facebook page to check him out but I didn’t want to do that. Anyway, too much emphasis is placed on looks,’ she says.Their decision to wed appears to have been based instead on gut instinct, blind faith, trust and what Sarah describes as ‘a deep connection’, plus a shared history of past relationship traumas.Sarah, who has one failed marriage behind her and still lives with an ex-partner in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, says: ‘I can’t remember who brought it up, but one of us said, “We get on so well — maybe we should get married”.’Paul, a father of teenage girls aged 15 and 13 who lives in Chichester, West Sussex, says: ‘I think the whole idea came about because I asked her what she was doing for Christmas and I said, “How about we have our first date on Christmas Day?”‘Then I had another lightbulb moment and suggested, “How about we go on holiday for our first date? Life’s too short.”‘The subject of marriage came up and Sarah said, “I’ve always thought about going on that programme where couples get married at first sight.” I laughed and said, “Let’s get married, then”.’Thankfully, after that first meeting the ten-hour transatlantic flight served only to cement their determination to marry, and they arrived at 2.30pm local time to prepare for the evening wedding.Even minister Roland August, who starred as Elvis in the Katy Perry music video Waking Up In Vegas, found it all stranger than fiction, telling me: ‘They are the first couple I have ever married on their first date.‘It’s quite unusual, even in Vegas! But Sarah and Paul seem made for each other and I wish them all the best in life.’Indeed, the new Mr and Mrs Edwards do seem likeable, down-to-earth, intelligent and considerate characters who both sound terribly sincere about making this marriage work.          Sarah, pictured, picked up a designer wedding dress in the internet for £100But are they in love?There is a slightly awkward ‘whatever love means’ moment, reminiscent of Prince Charles’s reply when he was asked the same question at a press conference announcing his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer.‘There was a definite spark when we first met at the airport,’ says Sarah, choosing her words carefully. ‘What is important to us is the commitment, from which love will develop and grow. We’ve both had relationships where we did it the normal way round and it didn’t work out, so why not do it this way instead? In many ways it feels more traditional, choosing to commit based on shared values, interests and morals rather than just physical attraction.’Paul adds: ‘We are not in love yet. We’re still getting to know each other — that will come with time. But yes, we do fancy each other, which helps.‘Our wedding night wasn’t awkward because we’d talked about it at length beforehand, sharing with each other what we liked and disliked, so there would be no misunderstandings. We both have a high sex drive.’Rather than viewing their union as a madcap adventure, the couple prefer to compare it to wartime marriages, which often had the briefest of courtships but, based on solid, realistic foundations, stood the test of time.Their families, however, took some convincing.Sarah, who moved to Britain from New Zealand when she was 18, says: ‘My parents were very shocked and urged me to wait, saying, “Why don’t you just go on holiday instead?”          The pair had been corresponding online for only nine days before first meeting ‘They insisted on speaking to Paul on the phone, and after 30 minutes they felt much more reassured. I’m looking forward to introducing my husband to my family and friends — if I have any friends left after this, because most of them have disowned me.’Likewise, Paul’s father advised caution, especially as Paul was still recovering from a broken heart after his girlfriend of eight years broke off their engagement in February, just four weeks before their planned £20,000 country house wedding.‘I was very upset,’ says Paul, ‘but I’m grateful to my ex-fiancee now because if she was unhappy with me our marriage wouldn’t have lasted.‘I can see there wasn’t enough balance in my life, I sometimes worked 80-hour weeks and put my relationship second. But I was ready to commit to one person for ever and although I was disappointed that relationship broke down, it didn’t change that core belief.’Sarah, who had a happy childhood in Wellington, New Zealand, says she always longed to emulate her adoptive parents by having a long, happy and stable marriage, though the ideal has so far eluded her.Moving to Britain, where she worked as an estate agent before becoming a nanny, she says she fell into an abusive relationship before meeting her first husband, a dry-stone waller, when she was in her early 20s.They dated for more than four years before agreeing to marry, their blessing witnessed by Sarah’s family in New Zealand in 2012. Just six months later, however, the marriage was over.‘My first husband was very kind and gentle but we were more like best friends than husband and wife. I think I only married him because I felt my parents expected us to,’ she says.Shortly after their wedding, Sarah also discovered she was infertile and says: ‘I felt very guilty that Nick might never be able to have children with me and I might have prevented him marrying someone who could.‘After we split up, he went on to meet someone else and have a family, and he’s happy now, so I feel it was the right decision to end the marriage.’Moving from the North of England to Kent, Sarah next had a long-term relationship with an electrician that lasted for three-a-half years. After splitting up, they decided to carry on living together until the house could be sold — but in the meantime Sarah threw herself into internet dating, which proved soul-destroying.‘You’d go for a date and never hear from the guy again, or he’d treat you with no respect,’ she says. ‘I felt I deserved better, so I decided to give up and only saw Paul’s message when I logged on one last time to close my account.‘From the moment we first spoke, there was a connection I’d never felt before.‘We could be completely honest with each other about our histories. There was a mutual respect.’Raised by his father after his parents split up when he was two, Paul told Sarah about his ‘misspent youth’, which led to him leaving home at 16 and ending up homeless at 17, living on the streets for six months.Taken in by a church, he was helped back on his feet and worked as a nightclub lighting technician before moving into broadcasting.His first daughter was born when he was 21, but his relationship broke up and he had a second daughter by a subsequent relationship which also didn’t last.His daughters live with their mothers but Paul says he sees them regularly and took them out for lunch separately to break the news that he was marrying a woman he’d never met. Both accepted the news with a maturity beyond their years.‘My elder daughter — when she’d stopped laughing — said it was cool. My younger daughter didn’t laugh but was also supportive,’ says Paul.Sarah is looking forward to meeting them and hopes that, with the help of IVF, she and Paul will one day add to the family, once they have sorted out where they are going to live as a couple.Five days into their marriage, Paul proudly reports that they haven’t had a single row yet and are filled with optimism for the future, even though Sarah has already told her new husband to ditch his Next suits because her ex used to favour them.‘So far I have absolutely no regrets. More people should do it,’ he says, before adding: ‘But ask me again in a year.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Model Twiggy Python star Michael Palin honoured New Years list","story":"Twiggy, pictured left in 1966 and right in 2016, becomes a dame in the Queen\u0027s New Year Honours List for her services to fashion, the arts and charityIdentities of 44 BBC reporters working in Russia are leaked...Krokodil and the flesh-rotting horror of the drug that EATS...Share this articleActor and comedian Michael Palin, pictured in 2014, is honoured in the New Year\u0027s listThe award, included among 93 announced by the Foreign Office in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas New Year Honours List, is for his services to travel, culture and geography following his successful second career as a travel writer and television presenter.

On a wider scale, this suggests radical change in institutions and large organisations. The personal meaning is clear, too. The conjunction will give steely determination to all who seek change, and this will become more intense as 2019 progresses.The year ahead also brings an event that will be visible across the world, as Mercury, planet of communication, trade and commerce, traces a path across the face of the Sun in November. This Transit of Mercury won’t happen again until 2032.Twiggy was the symbol of Swinging London who was so iconic...Care home crisis as 8,000 beds for vulnerable pensioners...Share this articleThe last time one took place was May 2016. Just think about how the world has altered since then. Fires, floods, famines and fake news. Trump, Brexit, you name it — all the things we thought we could depend on have been thrown up in the air, and unparalleled and unimaginable change has affected all our lives.But the build-up to this year’s transit brings the potential for more honest communication and a sense of relief, as hidden agendas become clearer and new bonds of trust are nurtured.The Supermoon Lunar Eclipse in January, which sees the Moon turn red, gets us off to a flying start. It is one of many optimistic cosmic signs this year, and helps focus our intentions. With the right kind of motivation, this can be the moment when the intense period of upheaval we’ve been experiencing finally begins to ease.Then, as the doors to better communication gradually open, we can expect positive (if surprising) developments concerning difficult and isive issues, such as referendums, elections and breakdowns in trust.Jupiter, the planet of luck, adventure and boundless optimism, will be at full strength in its home sign of Sagittarius for almost all of 2019. That means we’re in for an adventure, too. Advances can be made on the most difficult of journeys, and there’s fun to be had.Along with this surge of optimism comes a quest for meaning and purpose. Not only will we develop a stronger belief in the potential to act with integrity and care for ourselves, our neighbours and our planet, but we might even see the occasional miracle!The new year also brings a chance to explore what we had once thought impossible.Jupiter’s relationship with the visionary dreaminess of Neptune represents a real opportunity to grow in roles we have never had the confidence to inhabit fully.Mars, the power planet, adds dynamism to the astrological mix, giving us the energy to find unexpected treasures.Uranus, the planet of revolution, begins to move forward after the first week in January. This signifies momentum and the chance to form hopeful new allegiances. Even those in conflict may find themselves on a similar track.But when Uranus returns to Taurus early in March, we can expect some shocks to the system. We might welcome the resulting innovation, but it will also remind us that security and stability can be necessary casualties on the road to genuine progress.The antidote for tumult lies with Saturn and Neptune’s long-awaited and encouraging alliance, which peaks three times in 2019.While taskmaster Saturn’s disciplined nature seems at odds with Neptune’s free-spirited, expressive style, these strange bedfellows encourage the best in each other. Saturn’s determined realism helps to cement Neptune’s dreams, ensuring that inspiring ideas become more than just wishful thinking.With their final tryst coinciding with the Transit of Mercury, the journey of 2019 will end optimistically. It will be a year of adventure, and will offer plenty of potential for revival and renewal, too, no matter your sign . . .ARIESMarch 21 — April 20The year begins with a creative flurry as January’s Supermoon Lunar Eclipse brings an opportunity to experiment and implement some imaginative solutions.As the event sees the Moon turn deep red, the celestial energy will be directed towards the revolutionary planet Uranus, which is ready to shake things up before leaving your sign.

I suppose I thought hanging Kahlo’s colourful visage in a utility vehicle seemed like a nice visual juxtaposition, or maybe even a gendered territorial pissing.Since I bought it a couple of years ago, Kahlo’s face has run rampant through the retail world, licensed to clothing brands such as Mango and Princesse Tam-Tam, stationery makers Grupo Erik, porcelain company Lladró, Flamingo Candles, giftware line Temerity Jones, and electronic accessories manufacturer Ecell. There’s also a Barbie doll, from Mattel.The air-freshener boutique is no longer there, but a few doors down a new shop sells Frida Kahlo makeup bags. Across the road from that is the Bendigo Art Gallery, now exhibiting Frida Kahlo, Her Photos. The 257 pictures from Kahlo’s collection include her own, but also some by contemporaries such as Man Ray and Pierre Verger.Here, Kahlo’s political beliefs are clearly represented. There are photos of indigenous Mexicans living simpler lives, and of figureheads such as Leon Trotsky, the Russian Marxist who briefly lived with Kahlo and her husband, the painter Diego Rivera. (After Kahlo’s death, Rivera would drape her coffin in the Soviet communist flag.) It begs the question: would an anticapitalist, whose 1932 painting Self-portrait on the Borderline between Mexico and the United States contrasts indigenous Mexican flowers and artefacts with the smoke-belching chimneys of a Ford factory, be pleased by the commodification of her image?It’s a hard question to answer, not least because Kahlo places herself bang in the middle of that painting, halfway between cultural preservation and capitalism. On the one hand, mass reproduction of her face might be comparable to Che Guevara posters and T-shirts in the 1980s, which Guevara’s own daughter denounced as an affront to his socialist ideals. On the other hand, Kahlo posed for her father from a young age and for other photographers throughout her life, creating what would now unapologetically be called a personal brand.All successful brands rely on condensing an idea to its very essence, and the Frida Kahlo Corporation, which licenses her image – and donates a portion of monies to charities committed to improving the life of women and children – is clear on its website about what it believes that essence is: “The brand represents a female role model, a strong woman.”And so, Kahlo’s face has become shorthand for modern feminism. Typing her name into Etsy’s search engine brings up 15,456 results of non-licensed merch. A T-shirt made in Bulgaria has the tag “girl power”. A sweatshirt is “the perfect present for any women you want to support, inspire and empower”. A phone case is billed simply as a “feminist phone case”.Sometimes the message can become confusing. In the UK, even before a blockbuster exhibition of Kahlo’s belongings ran at the V\u0026ampA in 2018, Theresa May wore a bracelet made up of miniature panels of the artist’s paintings at the Conservative party’s 2017 conference, prompting the  UK to ponder “the four things Theresa May might have been trying to say with her Frida Kahlo bracelet”.In the Bendigo Art Gallery shop, there are Frida Kahlo mugs, dioramas, cushions, vases, calendars, quilts, earrings, tote bags and pill boxes. Senior curator Leanne Fitzgibbon tells  Australia: “Frida Kahlo clearly understood the power of the self-portrait, and carefully constructed and controlled her image during her lifetime through her paintings, photography and her public presentation. As an inidual who crafted her image to convey her love of Mexican culture, her warrior-like strength and ability to overcome adversity, it’s likely she would be pleased to see her image shared so widely.”Travelling down from Echuca to the Bendigo exhibition is Jacqui Donchi-Berthaume, who discovered Kahlo at art school. “After being saturated with Magritte, Pollock, Warhol and Munch, it was a revelation to hear about a female artist from the back blocks,” she says. She agrees with Fitzgibbon that Kahlo might have approved of the proliferation of her image. “As much as we’d like to think of her as an accidental icon, Frida ran with the big horses,” she says. “She courted infamy internationally and was never what you would consider a folk obscurity, as fiercely loyal as she was to Mexican folklore and iconography. So while she was a hardened anticapitalist I think she would’ve gracefully accepted the chronic reiteration of her image, like Warhol or Bowie did. There’s been a postmodern ripple effect.”Meanwhile, Melburnian Rachel Boyce has a much-treasured photograph of herself and her mother wearing huipils to the first ever Frida Kahlo exhibition in Australia at the Art Gallery of South Australia in 1990, and has visited La Casa Azul (The Blue House), Kahlo’s home in Mexico City. “What’s not to be inspired by?” she says. “A bi, disabled, moustachioed, monobrowed, cross-dressing woman of colour. A gloriously extraordinary fashion icon who celebrated peasant clothes and traditional textiles. And an incredible, exquisite artist.”A few articles have dubbed Kahlo “the queen of selfies” Boyce isn’t impressed by that. “Self-portraiture and ‘selfie’ are not the same. That’s an odious and simplistic contemporary reading that places Kahlo in a Kardashian vortex,” she says. “I think of Kahlo more like Mirka Mora – lifelong lived art.”Some artists, though, have used Kahlo as an inspiration rather than appropriating her self-portraits. Working as Betty Jo Designs is Melbourne’s Liz Jones, who has created Kahlo wall hangings. “My version of her is a tribute to her distinctive appearance and wonderful artistic legacy,” she says. “I am mindful of the fact that Frida’s face has become a commodity. When you see reproductions of her self-portraits on everything from shower curtains to baby onesies, the personal meaning behind her work is diminished and her persona gets diluted into a mass-produced design concept.”Another Melbourne artist, Louise Saxton, reinterpreted one of Diego Rivera’s paintings in her own Desnuda y Flores 2015 after Diego Rivera 1944. “In my work the layering of delicate antique lace and hundreds of pins references Frida’s damaged spine and pelvis and the many difficult operations she underwent throughout her adult life,” she says. In another work, Frida after Kahlo, Saxton gives Kahlo swallow-tailed hummingbird eyebrows. It’s a reinterpretation, in antique and vintage needlework, of Kahlo’s own Self Portrait Dedicated to Marte R Gomez, from 1946.“I have never desired to buy into the commodification of Frida’s image,” says Saxton. “While she embraced publicity and appears to have enjoyed having her image reproduced, I do wonder if this kind of commodification of an artist’s body has, or would ever, happen to a man?”• Frida Kahlo, Her Photos runs at Bendigo Art Gallery until 10 February 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb835ac0f11ed1706edd690bf37c7060bab016c8/2352_849_5255_3153/master/5255.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=499c477cacdf609c8267dd48ae3fd7d5","title":"the street art of el paso texas in pictures","story":"More than 100 murals are painted in the Lincoln Park and El Segundo districts of El Paso, Texas, depicting the city’s Latino and Native American culture and community pride"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eba1b712ed58f1bcc706c55fc5b773c3aa84b577/0_156_2173_1304/master/2173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8ae2df127b6e57d723efc29e6979ed8","title":"amos oz israel novelist prophet never lost hope","story":"To critics at home, Oz was a bleeding-heart liberal – but to audiences around the world he was a literary giant, steadfast in his belief for a two-state solutionOn Friday afternoon, a text arrived from Israel letting me know of the death of Amos Oz, hailed for decades as that country’s greatest novelist. “The last, best voice of an Israel that is all but gone,” it read.Oz himself would doubtless have found a way to wave aside such talk, dismissing it as melodramatic. But there’s truth in it. For he was indeed the embodiment of a particular Israel, one that dominated in the first years of the state’s life but which has steadily receded to the margins.To his internal critics, he was the face of the mainly-Ashkenazi, European Jewish elite that built the country, a bleeding-heart liberal constantly scolding the nation for its ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands, a founder of the Peace Now movement who never stopped demanding his fellow Israelis behave more wisely and more justly. More than once he was denounced as a traitor, an insult he once told me he regarded as nothing less than “a badge of honour”, putting him in the same company as Jeremiah, Abraham Lincoln and Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion.Outside the country, however, he could make diaspora Jewish audiences swoon they saw him as a pin-up for the Israel of their dreams. Ruggedly handsome, his face battle-scarred by service in Israel’s 1967 and 1973 wars, he could have been a model of the “new Jew” the first Zionists longed to forge in the Mediterranean sun. They wanted the new Israeli to be a soldier, farmer and poet. Oz was all three, a member of Kibbutz Hulda where he took his turn picking fruit and washing dishes, turning over the proceeds of his novels to the collective coffers.In a way, that man was Oz’s first invented character. He was not born an Oz, but a Klausner, growing up not on a kibbutz, but in Jerusalem. His father was a scholar and librarian the future novelist was raised in what he called “a house full of footnotes”. He fled to the kibbutz aged 15, renaming himself Oz – Hebrew for strength.The trigger for that escape and reinvention may well have been the suicide of his mother, Fania, when Amos was just 12. Indeed, that event haunted Oz’s fiction. When we met in 2001, he told me that it was the mystery he had spent his life, and his books, “trying to decode”. He confronted it most explicitly in what may well be his finest work, A Tale of Love and Darkness, a novelistic memoir thought to be the biggest-selling literary work in Israeli history.Throughout Oz’s fiction, the same motifs recur: interlocking love triangles, oedipal longings, unspoken desires, often attached to a protagonist paralysed into inaction and a woman out of reach. A mystery might linger – perhaps a buried scandal, related to the country’s recent past. They are quiet, but intensely evocative stories, full of both the intimacy of relationships and of place, especially the Jerusalem of the author’s youth.Yet Oz’s novels were fated to be read as manifestos, each one assumed to be a veiled address on the state of the nation. It was not abnormal for Shimon Peres to review an Oz novel Peres was only one of several Israeli prime ministers known to summon the novelist for what he called “a late night tête-à-tête”. Part of that was what Oz described as “the Judeo-Slavonic tradition”, which insisted a novelist also play the role of prophet, telling the tribe where they were going wrong. Oz chafed against that a bit, once complaining to me that, “No one expected Virginia Woolf to write about the Munich agreement, but everyone assumes my novels are parables about the new intifada.”But part of it was his own fault, because Oz had a twin career as an essayist and polemicist. He was one of a group of young writers to edit an anthology immediately after the six-day war of 1967 – they called it The Seventh Day – which argued that Israel should immediately give up the land it had won in the West Bank and Gaza, and seek the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That was an outlandishly radical stance at the time, but within three decades it would become the international consensus. Oz never abandoned it.His great gift was to express complex moral ideas through compelling metaphor, even in his second language of English. He would argue that after the Holocaust the Jews were a drowning man: they therefore had the right to grab hold of a piece of driftwood, even if it meant forcing another man, the Palestinians, to share it. What they did not have was the right to grab the entire piece of wood and force the other man into the sea – which is what Israel had done in 1967. He would say that Jews and Palestinians both understood that a two-state solution was necessary, the problem lay with their leaders: “The patient is ready for the operation,” he wrote. “But the surgeons are cowards.”Some found him hard to categorise. In Israel, he was a trenchant critic and dissenter. Outside, he was a fierce defender of his country with little patience for those who could not understand the Jewish need for a home of their own. If he had an ideology, it was hostility to fanaticism and a belief in compromise. He believed that compromise was too often seen “as weakness, as pitiful surrender”. Whereas, he wrote, “in the lives of families, neighbours and nations, choosing to compromise is in fact choosing life”. The opposite of compromise is not pride or integrity, he argued. “The opposite of compromise is fanaticism and death.”Oz was garlanded with prizes and adoring audiences in Europe especially – his essay How to Cure a Fanatic is taught in Swedish schools – and he was often mentioned as a possible Nobel contender. In Israel, he continued to enjoy a large and attentive readership. But his views, which once reflected those of half of the population, became ever more marginal in his own land. The peace constituency shrank fewer Israelis rallied to his message of enlightened compromise.But he never lost his belief that the story of Israel and Palestine would end with resolution. Like so many before him in that part of the world, he insisted the promised land lay ahead – even if he would not live to see it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7747d20198fce1dee412286fcf63cd48fd87b4b/94_22_3384_2031/master/3384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f9b578e3060f982f8c25d5bc8345c12","title":"markets in europe and asia rally to stem some of december losses","story":"FTSE 100 records best day for rising share prices since AprilStock markets across Europe and Asia rallied on Friday to stem some of December’s heavy losses, with London’s FTSE 100 recording its best day for rising share prices since April.The Dow Jones was slightly down by Friday lunchtime in New York on a calmer day of trading after three wild sessions this week either side of Christmas Day.Global stock markets have have declined since early October when it became clear that the US president, Donald Trump, was digging in for a long trade war with China.The febrile atmosphere in the run-up to Christmas intensified after Trump turned his fire on the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, accusing him of making a mistake by raising interest rates.Trump’s refusal to accept legislation to fund government agencies unless it also contained money to build his wall on the US border with Mexico, which led to the partial shutdown of the federal government over Christmas, has added to the mood of uncertainty.Chris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at the online trader IG, said traders were finding it difficult to forecast the direction of the US and global economies without any extra economic data and while the political heat was high.“The bounce of the past few days has taken place while the economic and macro backdrop remains frozen, with little movement on the trade wars, Brexit and now the government shutdown debates that have been such drivers of sentiment and flows over the past year or more,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6eb1316ecfa23b8b20ccceaeaf2bcacad97b71f/0_87_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fed123f38b1b215b8fb16fb96e9a72f9","title":"the year in business who were the winners and losers","story":"From the collapse of Carillion to the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, 2018 was a tumultuous year• Days into 2018, the government outsourcing and construction business Carillion collapsed into bankruptcy.

But the loss of the sole high-street purveyor of pop music has extra significance, even for someone who was not a fan of the store. I have many fond memories of record shops, but not one misty-eyed recollection involves buying the music that changed my life from HMV.Since this establishment chain last dodged the jaws of death, it hasn’t kept up with changing times. And if you do nurse sentimental feelings about its passing, obviously empathise with the soon-to-be unemployed, but never forget that it was the march of the music super chains (including the long-gone Our Price, Virgin and Tower Records) which led to the dwindling numbers of bijou record shops.HMV was always, even its heyday, the first port of call for beginners and general music consumers, where in more innocent times music as a physical artefact for novices was purchased. You wouldn’t expect to find knowledgeable advice (although had you done so, it was always available). An acquaintance worked in the buying office of one chain: not a music fan or aficionado herself, she gladly passed on to me the rare white labels retrieved from the skip, as this shop did not care about championing edgy new acts or stocking fresh talent. HMV was where you went to buy chart records (vinyl, cassette or later CDs) with your Christmas vouchers. It was never for open-minded obsessives or specialists, not for rarities or vintage never really a hub where bands were formed and labels were launched where you called in to check out what was new.Specialist, boutique record shops were often (and can still be) intimidating: my earliest purchase was as a child of 11, wading undaunted through a gaggle of sneering blokes to buy Bowie’s Pin Ups in a now defunct shop in my home town of Swindon. Similar shops are thriving thanks to the vinyl revival, or by being friendly and well-stocked. Can you imagine HMV selling a cloth bag designed by a local artist, as Monorail in Glasgow does? HMV never became a honeypot for crate diggers: those obsessives found riffling through piles of rare old vinyl (or even CDs). Fopp is better stocked, as are small outlets such as the excellent Piccadilly Records in Manchester.Yes, the internet is obviously largely to blame. But it is also not that simple: HMV has gone the way of Spudulike or Woolworths, we just stopped needing or wanting its services. They were outdated and subsequently superseded. HMV began to sell books and equipment, but such obvious ersification didn’t save it: the internet again, and the fact plain and simple that it’s convenient to click and purchase and there is little need for a cavernous, everything-under-one-roof music emporium.Rough Trade and smaller shops will survive – for which we should be pleased – but the disappearance of HMV is part of the inevitable demise of high-street destination shopping. Growing nostalgic vinyl obsession will save smaller, traditional boutique shops. HMV was where your grandparents imagined you still “bought records”.

Migrants are a long-running target, of course those deemed to be undeserving benefit claimants, such as teenagers mothers, are another traditional favourite. On one level, there is a perversely ingenious strategy at play. The more the government shrinks the nation’s council housing stock as a deliberate policy, the more those languishing on waiting lists feel as though they are competing for scarce resources, and the more they are incentivised to delegitimise other “competitors” as undeserving. The government is let off the hook.Which brings me to the case of Labour backbencher Kate Osamor, who spent Christmas enduring a media storm because she declared that she was “proud, not ashamed” to be a council tenant. This is a disgrace, apparently, because someone on a parliamentarian’s salary should free up their house for the more deserving. This line of argument is not only wrongheaded, it goes some way to explaining why a housing crisis has enveloped Britain.First things first: the architects of the nation’s housing crisis sit in No 10. Housebuilding is at its lowest peacetime level since the 1920s, and the failure to replace council housing flogged off under right to buy leaves 1.15 million families trapped on waiting lists. Rather than the “property-owning democracy” promised by Margaret Thatcher, home ownership has declined to 1980s levels, and is in a state of collapse among younger Britons. Four in 10 of the properties sold off under right to buy are now owned by private landlords charging twice as much as local authorities did. With fewer council houses available to rent, and a derisory number built under Tory rule, those who once would have been council tenants have been driven into an insecure, expensive private rental sector which has doubled in size over the past 25 years. The failure to build council housing means the taxpayer instead spends over £9bn a year subsidising private landlords charging rents people cannot afford.Some might argue that while all the above is true, if affluent social tenants like Osamor vacated their properties, that would surely ameliorate the housing crisis. Taking this argument on its own terms: no it would not. Government research in 2014 suggested that there were between 3,000 and 8,000 social households whose residents earned more than £80,000 a year: bear in mind that there are more than 4 million remaining social houses in England and Wales. Evicting affluent social tenants from their homes wouldn’t even amount to a pinprick on the housing crisis.But the logic of this argument is all wrong in any case. Nye Bevan’s ambitious postwar council house building programme rejected the idea that council housing should only be provided for those deemed to be “working class”. As he put it: “We should try to introduce in our modern villages and towns what was always the lovely feature of English and Welsh villages, where the doctor, the grocer, the butcher and the farm labourer all lived in the same street. I believe that is essential for the full life of a citizen … to see the living tapestry for a mixed community.”The assault on council housing has attempted to unpick this honourable dream. Instead, the diminishing stock is prioritised for those most in need. There are still council tenants from varied backgrounds: nurses, supermarket workers, care workers. But the residents of what remains of council housing disproportionately tend either to be elderly – often longstanding tenants who did not use “right to buy” – or those in the most difficult circumstances. It creates ghettos for the poor, rather than socially erse communities.This approach leads to the stigmatisation of social housing: their tenants are frequently demonised (one proffered “backronym” for “chavs” is “council housed and violent”), and younger people are encouraged to shun council housing in favour of a homeowning dream that becomes ever more distant. The destruction of the universalist principle behind public services – that everyone pays in and everyone gets something back – hurts the poorest the most. As the British social researcher Richard Titmuss put it, “services for the poor end up being poor services”.Osamor may have a large majority, but being an MP is hardly stable employment, and she got a council house when she was a homeless single parent. Are we saying that once those in the most adverse circumstances achieve a more comfortable standard of living, they are to be evicted from their family home? What the victimisation of Osamor underlines is the desperate need to reimagine council housing as an option for all.Bevan believed that council housing should be of a better standard than private housing. Today, that means everything from bigger living spaces – the British home is shrinking – to proper insulation to take on fuel poverty and combat climate change. If Osamor wanted to restrict council housing, then she would rightly be condemned as a hypocrite: but she doesn’t, she advocates a mass council housebuilding programme. That doesn’t mean Labour’s current plans are ambitious enough – they’re not. The Scottish and Welsh governments have suspended right to buy, given the mass depletion of council housing stock: Labour should demand the same in England. Labour should be pushed to commit to a higher proportion of council housing in its “million homes” commitment, too.We are supposed to live in a representative democracy, and parliament should look like the nation it serves. Accordingly, we should bemoan the fact that there are too few MPs who are social tenants, not that there are too many. Increasing the number would mean that the rights and needs of social tenants would be more likely to be championed, and that council housing would be forced higher up the political agenda. It would also mean that MPs were closer to the communities they represent.Osamor has temporarily displaced Diane Abbott as the black female politician the British media love to kick. But all those hounding her are achieving is letting the government off the hook for a housing crisis created in No 10."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff3e0872a0314c46ab5f44d36ba6e13137ce8ec0/626_151_4846_2907/master/4846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=366982226490fc57320d58102ac1f768","title":"silver linings 2018 world cup summer","story":"The World Cup, a slew of great music, the endless summer, some unsung heroes, and the fact that Neighbours is still going – 2018 wasn’t all bad, you knowYes, Donald Trump is still in charge of 6,450 nuclear warheads.

He enjoys the “multi-generational aspect” of his gig audiences now. “I love to look out and see children on the shoulders of their parents,” he enthused. “One day I hope to see grandparents with their middle-aged children on their shoulders, and atop them their millennial kids who, in turn, bear the weight of their newborn offspring. Great, tottering towers of life, all singing along, head to toe in my fucking merch.” Gallagher is like King Arthur and the Dalai Lama combined, and would doubtless be a shoo-in in any direct election for an emergency prime minister. We can but hope.• Steven Poole is the author of Rethink, You Aren’t What You Eat, Unspeak, and Trigger HappyIt’s not surprising, perhaps, that bang in the middle of one of the grumpiest and most isive years in living memory, a moment of massed togetherness – with musical accompaniment, on a hot June night, with my niece and daughters – was one of my highlights. The love that filled Wembley stadium was for Taylor Swift on her Reputation tour, but we were all feeling it. When she paused halfway through New Year’s Day, which she sang on her own at the piano, the crowd started cheering into the silence, and didn’t stop. Affection and enthusiasm filled the evening alone on the huge stage, she looked momentarily overwhelmed. I’ve been to lots and lots of concerts (my husband is a pop critic), and have never experienced anything like it. So often fame at this level seems corrosive, dysfunctional. In her emotionally literate, commercial, diligent way, with an album and tour that are all about celebrity – in the aftermath of her humiliating public spat with Kanye West – Swift is trying to make superstardom work out for her. The tour film is on Netflix on New Year’s Eve.In the last few months I’ve made space in my life for yoga, after a gap of many years. I was so well-taught in my 20s – by a wonderful teacher, Silvia Prescott, who wrote in the  about her own teacher, the famous BKS Iyengar, after he died – that I can still do the poses, and am stiff in exactly the same places. If I hadn’t already done it, this would be my new year’s resolution.More women singing: Caroline, Or Change by Tony Kushner (with music by Jeanine Tesori) was the best play I saw this year, at Hampstead theatre (it’s now in the West End). The story is about an unhappy chapter of Kushner’s childhood, in rural Louisiana following the death of his mother. Sharon D Clarke plays Caroline – the family’s servant, who spends most of her days doing laundry in a sweltering basement. The music and the performances, the portrayal of black and Jewish lives rubbing up against each other in the 1960s deep south, the relationship between the boy and the woman, were so striking and artful as to be life-giving.This year was full of terrible events – we’re hurtling towards environmental destruction, mumble rap is very popular and makes no sense (see Lil Pump’s Gucci Gang), and Brexit is a never-ending disaster – but there are reasons to be cheerful.Another highlight in 2018 was the rediscovery of a “lost” John Coltrane record. A holy grail for jazz anoraks like myself, this 1963 recording of the saxophonist’s classic quartet was found in the basement of Coltrane’s ex-wife’s house and reissued in June. Over its six unreleased tracks, Both Directions at Once showcases the languorous beauty of Coltrane’s playing, cementing his status as a titan not only of the genre but of music in all its timelessness.Finally, I was cheered in 2018 by Neighbours. Not the people who live next door, but the long-running Australian soap. I may be the only person in the UK who still watches it daily and revels in the moral utopia of Ramsay Street a place where everyone knows your name and nothing bad ever really happens. But it’s for this reason I’m thankful that Neighbours (incredibly) hasn’t been cancelled. The show is a 30-minute void where your mind can empty to imbibe the sun-soaked optimism and hackneyed dialogue of its characters – it is mindfulness for the couch potato, another remedy for the over dramatisation of our lives.• Ammar Kalia is a  journalist and holder of a Scott Trust bursaryA few pence on a shopping bag and the wider damning of plastic are bringing not only cleaner roads, but a return to paper. The high street is now a throng of colourful and clever design, as retailers come up with ever more distinctive carriers. Meanwhile, the refurbished loos at the local Marks \u0026amp Spencer have replaced their deafening and useless hot-air driers with good old-fashioned paper towels, Scandi-style. Which prompts the thought – romantic (and media dinosaur) that I am – that this rediscovery of paper could extend to the news industry, and a revival of the actual printed newspaper, alongside all the hi-tech stuff.Much of the UK basked in a long, warm summer – a glorious antidote to the agonies of Brexit. London took on a Mediterranean feel (in a good way). People looked happier there was no agonising over what to wear, colourful sundresses and shorts became the cheerful uniform (which also helped the economy because we had to buy more of them). You could actually plan a picnic. Bars and restaurants were full.It may have been a warning of the climate-change perils to come, but for a time it was possible to believe that just a little bit of sunshine might do us good.With an interest more in Russia than in football, I girded for the 2018 World Cup with foreboding. How would Russia, with its Soviet heritage, its ponderous bureaucracy, its lumbering transport system and – how shall we say? – its often unreconstructed attitude to exuberant free expression, cope with millions of foreign fans spread out over a dozen cities? I feared the worst – the worst being racist and homophobic chanting, even attacks, and heavy-handed police, quick to crack heads.But the worst didn’t happen. Legions of foreigners, British included, praised the efficiency of the organisation, the warmth of the hosts, and the gap between the dire warnings and their happy experience.I am not saying that Russia changed for ever overnight, nor that there has been no backsliding by officialdom since. But the 2018 World Cup gave a glimpse of a more relaxed, welcoming and modern Russia that would have been inconceivable even 10 years ago. And it fostered the hope that one day its leaders might come to trust the people and this Russia could prevail.• Mary Dejevsky is a writer and broadcasterAmid all the gloom this year, I was absolutely amazed by a visit I made in June to the labs of Prof Molly Stevens at Imperial College London. The biomedical research in which she and her remarkable team are engaged is – in the true sense of the word – awesome.From early diagnosis of HIV to advances in oncology that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, scientists such as Stevens are expanding the frontiers of medical knowledge and transforming the potentialities of health technology. Even as politics slides depressingly into polarised populism, and celebrities sell idiot pseudo-science, these warriors of human progress are the real deal.My own year was dominated by culture as editor of the new magazine Drugstore Culture, which launched in September: setting up such a venture with an extraordinary group of journalists has been a rare privilege in itself. In this context, it’s hard to pick out a single production or creative event – but I would give a special mention to Julius Caesar at London’s new Bridge theatre.What Nicholas Hytner and Nick Starr have achieved in this riverside palace of the imagination shows what can be accomplished by determination, enterprise and cultural agency. But this immersive production starring David Morrissey as Mark Antony and Ben Whishaw as Brutus – beginning with a scratch band of actors playing rock songs as audience members mingled in the forum – was particularly remarkable.For me, though, this was definitively the year in which today’s younger generation staked its claim to the political future. At the start of 2018, the People’s Vote campaign looked dangerously like the liberal elite asking for its job back by the end, its driving force were youth groups like For Our Future’s Sake and Our Future Our Choice, represented by eloquent tribunes such as Femi Oluwole, Will Dry and Lara Spirit.To characterise this cohort as losers or remoaners is a serious category error. They do not want to refight the 2016 referendum. Observing the spectacular failure of the Brexit project – mostly a failure of my age-group, Generation X – they want a say in their future. Dig the new breed, and cheer up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63eafe288af02359729b436b426f8dff1618690e/0_217_6512_3907/master/6512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f1e9f25abdad26822bf7d2a82bb012","title":"the guardian view on small town britain","story":"The closure of 127 public libraries did not get much attention amid the turmoil of 2018, but that does not make it a small story. The loss was felt by users of the culled services and those who worked in them. According to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, local authority spending on libraries fell by £30m to £741m over the past year.That is a tiny fraction of public spending. The NHS budget for England last year was £124.7bn and, while libraries matter, it is hard to argue that they matter more than life-saving operations. Yet they also matter in ways that are harder to measure, and their loss tells a more profound story of national malaise. Partly it is a story of austerity, but it does not start there. The loss of facilities behind the frontline of public service is part of a protracted hollowing out of the public realm that increasingly makes itself felt in the decay of nationwide political solidarity.A library gives meaning to an area beyond measurable economic utility and its closure provokes feelings of communal redundancy. It is an affront to civic pride. A place without its library is less of a place, just as a high street without a post office is a lesser high street and a town without its own hospital is less of a town. Over time, the withdrawal of services accelerates regional disparities and erects cultural barriers between small and large conurbations. Some towns are protected by proximity to hub cities. Those that are not experience the alienation that is often described as feeling “left behind”. The term is too often used to mean inability – or unwillingness – to participate in the modern globalised era, with the implication of reactionary social attitudes. It is used to conjure an image of benighted former industrial centres where underskilled older white Britons rail impotently against progress. That caricature is too simple and too fatalistic. It casts people as victims of history who need compensation but cannot otherwise be helped, which is patronising and ineffective. More proactive rehabilitation is required.Research by the Centre for Towns (CfT), a thinktank, finds people in small towns more likely than city dwellers to feel that their area is less well off than others and more neglected by politics. Small towns also suffer from population imbalances. Between 1981 and 2011, UK towns and villages studied by the CfT lost over a million people under the age of 25, and gained 2 million over-65s. By contrast, major cities gained over 300,000 under-25s and lost around 200,000 over-65s. That shift has economic and political consequences. The 2017 general election was marked by a national swing from Conservative to Labour, but many small towns, places such as Wigan, Mansfield and Wakefield, defied the trend.Meanwhile, older populations feel more pressure from shortfalls in social care costs and NHS spending. On the last day that parliament sat this year, the government let slip that public health budgets for local authorities will be slashed by £85m next year. Ambitious youth flees to the big city, while those who stay are made to feel like failures. That dynamic plays out in areas that have already weathered decades of ideological inclemency, starting with the laissez-faire approach of the 1980s that treated decline as a correction imposed by the market on places with obsolescent economic capacity – colliery towns, for example. New Labour brought higher spending to palliate the effects of Thatcherism, but that looked more like managed decline than a strategy to reverse it. Then, after 2010, came the ravages of austerity. Now there is the threat of a fourth cruel chapter written by new technology: online shopping squeezing high street margins, turning town centres ever more ghostly.None of this was or is inevitable. It has been convenient for policymakers to treat globalisation as an irresistible force of nature, but whether powerful forces do good or ill depends on how they are handled. Defences can be built against storms strong winds can turn turbines.The essential change that must happen is recognition that place, identity and politics are linked in potent ways at a level well below the nation state. The grievances that express themselves in national politics are generated by corrosion of regional and municipal self-confidence. The way to rebuild solidarity and heal wounds opened by the referendum is to rehabilitate people’s belief that the place they live matters, that it is respected as integral to the fabric of the nation. That requires a conceptual shift in the allocation of resources and a less utilitarian view of what local services provide. Counting footfall in a small library or village post office is a poor measure of its value and so underestimates the cost of a closure.In 1945, writing in the smouldering ruins of Europe after the second world war, John Maynard Keynes said: “The day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs, and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied … by our real problems – the problems of life and of human relations”. Keynes understood that policies of tax-and-spend are not ends in themselves but means to achieve greater political goals. Protecting the character of towns and villages is one such goal.There are economic benefits that flow from protecting local services, keeping struggling communities afloat, but the greater gain is in political stability. Allowing places to feel “left behind” has incubated disaffection with the institutions that uphold British democracy, above all parliament. It is in the interests of citizens in thriving areas to subsidise less economically self-sufficient parts of the country. And no one should be squeamish about calling it subsidy. National political units are held together by shared identity, which in practice requires consensual transfer of wealth and resources from rich to poor. Such redistribution is legitimised by a sense of common national destiny and also reinforces that solidarity. That is true of subsidy between regions as well as iniduals.The call for national unity and the wish that social isions would heal is common enough in politics, although often it is a veiled demand by ideologues of left and right that their view be allowed to prevail – unity by the extinction of dissent. But there is no route to solidarity by enforcing uniform political thinking. The better way is by valuing ersity and plurality, not just of opinion but of the areas that shape the way people think. That means investing in small things that make a big difference to small places – starting with the library."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f468e9f59d03aaef556c67a20a3707d69c83566f/0_1_5244_3147/master/5244.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7215062f162c0a38a1a2f4983c4f81b3 645w","title":"barack obama list best of 2018 books films and music","story":"The former US president is still releasing his best-of lists, and 2018’s includes everyone from Lauren Groff to Nancy Wilson, via the Carters and The Death of StalinBarack Obama has continued his tradition of publishing end-of-year lists, compiling the books, songs and films that the former US president has most enjoyed over the passed 12 months, with Zadie Smith, Beyoncé and Jay Z’s Apeshit and Armando Iannucci’s political satire The Death of Stalin all included.“As 2018 draws to a close, I’m continuing a favourite tradition of mine and sharing my year-end lists,” Obama wrote on Facebook, adding that the list included work that he found “thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved”. The lists – which started in 2015, while he was still in office – are meant to highlight work from famous and lesser-known writers, directors and musicians.In 2018, Obama read biographies including David W Blight’s study of Frederick Douglass, the anti-slavery advocate and intellectual (Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom) and tennis star Arthur Ashe: A Life by Raymond Arsenault. Max Tegmark’s cautionary examination of what human life might look like in a future with superintelligent AI, Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, was also included, as was fiction in the form of Florida by Lauren Groff.Obama started the tradition in 2015 when he released a playlist of the songs he’d been listening to, including artists such as the Isley Brothers, and Coldplay. He added book recommendations later that year, including Ta-Nehisi Coates’ celebrated book about race and America, Between the World and Me. In 2016, he recommended Pulitzer prize-winner Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, as well as Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train and H Is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald.This year’s film list was no less tasteful, with Palme d’Or winner Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters, sitting alongside Barry Jenkins’ James Baldwin adaptation, If Beale Street Could Talk and Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-tipped Roma.

The ducks, which e to find food, have also been trained to feed from submerged, floating feeding stations that only they can access.The pioneering reintroduction by the Wildfowl \u0026amp Wetlands Trust (WWT), Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Peregrine Fund and the Madagascan government comes 12 years after the apparently extinct species was rediscovered by chance.Lily-Arison Rene de Roland, the local director of the Peregrine Fund, was working on the conservation of another rare bird, the Madagascar harrier, when he spotted the duck on a remote crater lake high in the mountains. Tropical ducks are far less colourful than their northern counterparts because unpredictable weather means they need to be able to breed all year round and so the males do not acquire colourful feathers for annual mating rituals.Ornithologists soon realised that the last surviving 25 or so ducks were breeding successfully, but their ducklings were never reaching maturity because the lake was too deep and cold for the young birds to survive and find food.In 2009, Durrell, WWT and partners took one-day-old chicks from the lake to rear in captivity at a nearby breeding centre. The captive population has been painstakingly increased to 114 live birds today.According to Glyn Young, Durrell’s head of birds, the pochard declined to the brink of extinction because non-native fish species were introduced to Madagascar wetlands for fish farming. “It looks as though introduced fish across Madagascar are largely responsible for the decline of the duck,” he said.Carp released into the wetlands stirred up the water so the ing ducks could not find food so easily, and herbivorous fish such as tilapia stripped crucial vegetation from the lakes.In 2017, Scottish salmon farming cages were converted into the world’s first floating pre-release aviaries and shipped from the UK to Madagascar, where they were assembled on Lake Sofia this spring. The first ducklings were transferred to shore-based aviaries in October, and moved into the floating aviaries in early December. They are now swimming freely on the lake.It is hoped that the floating aviary and feeding stations will encourage the ducks to remain on Lake Sofia and breed. Conservationists have been working to ensure the habitat is more suitable than other lakes badly degraded by fish farming.Conservationists said the support of the local community living around the lake – who depend on it for fish – had been vital to the project.WWT’s head of conservation breeding, Nigel Jarrett, said: “Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.“If we can make this work, it will provide a powerful example not just of how to save the planet’s most threatened species, but how communities can manage an ecosystem to benefit people and wildlife, especially in areas of significant poverty.”Young added: “The restoration programme at Lake Sofia will encourage others in Madagascar to no longer look at the island’s wetlands as lost causes. They may once again be centres of bioersity while continuing to support communities of people who have also come to depend on them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95a0e876ab5a84d98b37172b76db77290afcf55e/0_31_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a49c275526c185403aa0c65dc03cc59","title":"vital ecosystems in tidal flats lost to development and rising sea levels","story":"Coastal development and sea level rise are causing the decline of tidal flats along the world’s coastlines, according to research that has mapped the ecosystems for the first time.Scientists from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and the University of Queensland used machine-learning to analyse more than 700,000 satellite images to map the extent of and change in tidal flats around the globe.Tidal flats are mud flats, sand flats or wide rocky reef platforms that are important coastal ecosystems. They act as buffers to storms and sea level rise and provide habitat for many species, including migratory birds and fish nurseries.Nicholas Murray, the study’s lead author and a senior research fellow at the centre for ecosystem science at the University of New South Wales, said because tidal flats were often at least partially covered by water they had been difficult to monitor in the past.“This is a big ecosystem,” he said. “It’s all over the planet and highly susceptible to threats but we haven’t known where they are, which has limited the ability to monitor them.”The research team worked with Google and used its computing resources to analyse every satellite image ever collected of the world’s coastlines.They found that tidal flats, as an ecosystem, were as extensive globally as mangroves and that coastal development and sea level rise, in particular, were causing their decline.In parts of China and western Europe, they found tidal flats that were up to 18km wide. In Australia, they occur all over the country, including places such as Moreton Bay in Queensland and along the Gulf of Carpentaria.Murray said airports, aquaculture and other infrastructure that had been built on top of tidal flats in countries such as China were major threats. Reduced sediment flows from rivers around the world had also led to a reduced amount of sediment being deposited as tidal flats.Murray said dams were one of the major drivers of reduced sediment flows from rivers. He said further analysis would be needed of the ongoing impact of the other key threat – sea level rise.“This study has really given the data to start making those links,” he said. “It means you can really start to understand the impact of sea level rise and coastal development.”The researchers suggest the study could be used to advance protected areas for tidal flats, which have not always been as well-protected historically because they fall between land and sea.The map is publicly available and Murray said it had laid the fundamentals for an ongoing monitoring system.“The easiest way to think about this is, for decades we’ve been able to observe deforestation,” he said. “We can now do that for tidal flat ecosystems.“We can identify places where tidal flat ecosystems are being lost and the main drivers of those losses, which will allow us to respond with conservation action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/254ff874d3e9850d0df97204821c15eb39cedfab/100_201_3089_1853/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c3a2bb24b4d2efc65a299a56e8ecff4","title":"angelina jolie today programme these testimonies went to a deeper place","story":"Radio 4 guest edit featured warnings of upsetting content, but it was more likely listeners would abandon all faith in humanityThe lasting memory of Angelina Jolie’s one-day Christmas tenure as editor of the Today Programme will be the horrific descriptions of violence: Rohingya Muslim women describing gang rapes Denis Mukwege, Nobel peace prize-winning doctor from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, describing injuries so barbaric that no “common sense of humanity” could survive them.Every second interview was prefaced with a warning to listeners that they may find it upsetting: but what an inadequate phrase that was. Swear words, natural disasters, sudden, high-pitched noises are upsetting these testimonies went to a deeper place. The warning should have been: “Some listeners may find themselves bereft of all faith in humanity.” And it wouldn’t have put anyone off: the value of beholding barbarism is only properly understood against its opposite, ignoring it.Jolie launched the prevent sexual violence initiative after making Land of Blood and Honey in 2012, a film about the Bosnian conflict. Her wingman was William Hague, as incongruous as a house elf, scuttling alongside her down the corridors of the United Nations. Rape as a weapon of war was the focus of much of the programme, with DRC, at its centre. The conventions of current affairs sat oddly in the context Mishal Husain, interviewing Nato’s supreme allied commander Europe, Curtis Scaparrotti, listened to his description of Rwanda (“the level of distress and … sheer evil was shocking”) attempted a bit of back-and-forth, some classic interviewer-y challenge: “And thus it has been through the ages,” she said. Women are always getting raped in conflict, is it realistic to think we can do anything about it? After a brief exposition about mankind and its responsibilities, Scaparrotti ended up making a social media point now that communication is so fast and so flat, it is easier to establish global moral absolutes, things we collectively cannot abide. But it was such a peculiar tilt at the topic, effectively asking someone to explain how violence can be bad, given that it is not new.Justin Webb, meanwhile, tried to add some grit by asking Jolie whether this should be the next direction for the #MeToo movement his meaning was perfectly plain – isn’t all this casting-couch sexual abuse a bit of a first world problem, when there two-year-olds being raped in front of their teenage mothers? Jolie elected, rightly I think, not to understand the question: it would have besmirched the project to launch into an explanation of why acts of sexual violence didn’t need to be pitted against one another in severity in order to be taken seriously. That awkward moment was smoothed over by his asking whether Jolie would ever run for president, to which her reply: “I go where I’m needed”, had a slightly uncomfortable, saintly ring, but delivered a semi-scoop for the bulletins. She might.And the news itself was particularly sobering: every half hour, the headlines would break into the most vivid stories about the realities of war, with a Home Office announcement that British boats should stop patrolling the Channel. Refugees might mistakenly think these were rescue boats, and that some civilised nation wanted to help, and therefore they would be more likely to undertake a perilous journey. That juxtaposition – what people might be fleeing, against an international moral order so dilapidated that its only response to displacement is to figure out how to make it someone else’s problem – must have been a coincidence. Jolie didn’t set the news grid. But that made it all the more affecting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/173c22d9644ca33a59296166b92a29f7e19a2cfa/0_452_4184_2510/master/4184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b77efc86c6c135066dedc505d40e4971","title":"keira knightley i cant act flirt or mother to get voice heard","story":"The star of Colette on Harvey Weinstein, Disney princesses and why her visceral essay about childbirth and the Duchess of Cambridge hit a nerveWhen Keira Knightley was small there were two things she knew she would become.

Still, she was a grade-A tomboy: no skirts, leading a protest at school until girls were allowed to play football. At 11, she was “obsessed by The Godfather. I wanted to be Al Pacino and that’s where I was heading. The great parts are the guys’ parts. You don’t want to be the pretty girl in the corner or the mum being lovable and supportive. Of course, when you grow up you are, but you still want to have the adventures.”Knightley’s entire career, from ball-busting breakthrough in Bend it Like Beckham to cross-dressing, trans-romancing Colette in her new film, has been an attempt to have adventures her younger self would respect. To explore if not what it would be like to be a man, then certainly “the masculine side of the female, stuck in the dresses and makeup. Almost every character I’ve played has tried to break out of that image of femininity. That’s why I like period films, because it’s such an overt cage you put the woman in. That’s always something I’ve really identified with. I feel like I sit somewhere else.”I look quizzical. “I’ve never wanted a penis,” she clarifies. “Apart from to piss up a tree. Being able to do that standing up: so convenient. You can just whip it out and whatever. But the idea of something so vulnerable swinging between my legs, I think I’m all right without.”Generally, it can be tricky encouraging stars away from unpacking art to chatting genitals. With Knightley, it’s like turning on a tap. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone simultaneously so famous and so garrulous (she’s also bracingly sweary). Or perhaps it’s something only those who have been A-listers more than half their life already can get away with.A few days after we meet, Knightley appears on Ellen DeGeneres’s chatshow to promote The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and mentions she has banned her young daughter, Edie (with husband James Righton, frontman of the new-rave band Klaxons), from watching the Disney classics Cinderella and A Little Mermaid because of their dodgy feminist messages. Twitter entered white-heat mode. Thinkpieces were spewed out like ticker tape. Presumably Disney – which also made The Nutcracker, which has since flopped – weren’t thrilled. But when asked about it again a fortnight later, instead of calming the waters, she went in with a whisk: doubling down on her argument with some PhD-level Disney princess knowledge.Still, she says in December when we speak again on the phone, being up for a fight doesn’t mean you want a punch. “I thought I was just being perky in an interview. My God, people feel really strongly. Don’t fuck with Cinderella. Her fans will end you.”Anyway, back to Colette. It’s the latest film from Wash Westmoreland, who made Still Alice with his husband, Richard Glatzer, before the latter died of ALS (also known as motor neurone disease) a fortnight after Julianne Moore’s Oscar win for lead actress. They co-wrote this one, too, and it’s clearly the work of a couple: intimate, barbed and funny. The plot revolves around Colette and her literary entrepreneur husband Willy (Dominic West), who pass off her novels as his, until Colette starts resenting the fiction, and Willy’s hypocritical jealousy over her affairs with a Louisiana heiress (Poldark’s Eleanor Tomlinson) and a gender-fluid aristocrat (Denise Gough) who never removes her suit. By and large, men fare badly. But Willy is, like Colette, finely drawn, charming for all his ludicrosity. In one scene, he wins his wife back by explaining that men are the weaker sex, slaves to their biology, ergo his endless shagging.“The Weaker Sex” is also the withering title of an essay Knightley wrote for a collection called Feminists Don’t Wear Pink And Other Lies, published in October. At the time, it caused a stink for what some perceived as an attack on the Duchess of Cambridge for looking glam hours after the birth of her daughter. Was she surprised? “The whole essay was about the silencing of women’s experience. So it’s interesting that’s exactly what happened from certain media outlets. They turned a moment of empathy from one body to another around to say: she’s shaming her.”Yet women seemed just as mean as men. “Yeah, that’s interesting. Internalised misogyny? I’m not criticising that. All of us respond to and survive within the culture in the way that we can. But I think we need to have a big look at ourselves.”Indeed. The duchess section is actually the blandest part of a blazing manifesto that starts with Knightley’s vagina splitting, swiftly brings in blood, poo, cracked nipples and incontinence pads, then closes with a broadside against male colleagues:“They tell me what it is to be a woman. Be nice, be supportive, be pretty but not too pretty, be thin but not too thin, be sexy but not too sexy, be successful but not too successful. … But I don’t want to flirt and mother them, flirt and mother, flirt and mother. I don’t want to flirt with you because I don’t want to fuck you, and I don’t want to mother you because I am not your mother. … I just want to work, mate. Is that OK? Talk and be heard, be talked to and listen. Male ego. Stop getting in the way.”The essay, says Knightley, was “just sort of vomited out”, submitted in a “fuck it” moment, published “because we have to harness this moment in time and use our voices to keep the conversation going. Because we’re saddled with a system built on inequality,” she says, “progress is going to be slow and painful and uncomfortable. But I want to make sure I’m not raising my daughter in fear of the whole other half of the human race. Just as it’s important to raise boys seeing the whole of a woman’s experience, not simply one aspect of femininity. Otherwise, how can you respect it?”The core problem, she reckons, is that the voices of a generation of women are lost to childcare. This means – to bring it back to straying Willy – that “we all empathise with men hugely because, culturally, their experience is so explored. We know so many aspects of even male sexuality. But we don’t feel like men can say: ‘Yes, I understand what you’re talking about because I’ve got this wealth of art and film and theatre and TV from your point of view.’”So if women don’t come on flirty or maternal, she thinks, some men get stumped. “Before motherhood, you’re sexy, but if we talk about the whole vagina-splitting thing then that’s terrifying there’s no sex there, so what we do is go into the virgin-mother retrofit, that’s nice and safe. The problem with those two images is I think very few women actually identify with them. Women are meant to play the flirt or the mother in order to get their voice heard. I can’t. It makes me feel sick.””On set, she was informed by a male director – not Westmoreland – exactly what she was: not passive-aggressive, but openly aggressive. Her eyes pop recalling the shock. “I thought that was extraordinary. I hadn’t raised my voice, I hadn’t sworn, I simply disagreed with a point. And this was someone I liked.”Look back over Knightley’s previous press and what sticks out – more, even, than her habit of irritating people by dint of crimes including her looks and niceness – is her composure. She has always seemed poised, someone of conviction and confidence, if not arrogance. Bumblings have been low-key she has kept it together.Not without effort, it turns out. Earlier this year, she told the Hollywood Reporter that she had had a breakdown aged 22, following five years of endless exposure. She didn’t leave the house for three months. A therapist said she was her first client who wasn’t being paranoid when she worried about people following her. She needed hypnotherapy to feel able to walk the Baftas red carpet for Atonement in 2007.The other reason Knightley speaks her mind is it would never occur to her not to. The perception is that she hails from high privilege. But her schooling was bog-standard her parents – playwright Sharman Macdonald and actor Will Knightley – thespy, but also relatively radical leftwing types. Not quite hippies, says Knightley, but as close as Teddington in south-west London probably got. She says she hadn’t realised how lucky she was to be raised by a father who loved the fact his wife often earned more than he did.In the film she is currently shooting, Misbehaviour, she plays Sally Alexander, a women’s libber among those who invaded the stage at Miss World 1970 with football rattles and flour bombs. Watch footage of the real Alexander today and you could be watching an older Knightley. These are her people: arty but determined, polite but forthright.And that, perhaps, is why Knightley’s pronouncements don’t – for me at least – stick in the throat. So much political rhetoric trotted out by film stars smacks of the bandwagon: rote homilies, recited without too much consideration.Knightley sings from a more sophisticated hymn sheet. Take Miss World. Plainly, she’s not a fan: “I’d never seen a beauty competition before but you think, wow this is really out there! The way they turn their arses and the cameras panning up and down. The way society as a whole goes: ‘Oh no, this is fine.’”But while the actions of Alexander et al were “amazingly brave”, she’s not sure she would have done the same, because the contestants felt they were being attacked. “That was unfair. And having been on stage, if something like that happened it would be utterly terrifying.”She is even measured when I asked about Harvey Weinstein, giving “credit where credit’s due he was very good at getting independent cinema an audience”. They had most contact around the time of The Imitation Game, when she wasn’t remotely in need of patronage, and pregnant – both reasons he didn’t try it on, she thinks. “And maybe he just didn’t fancy me, could be as simple as that.”She swears ignorance over his alleged assaults. “I absolutely knew he was a womaniser, because you could see it. But I thought that was consensual, and I’d never heard he’d raped anybody. Everyone knew he was a bully because he would scream and shout. But it wasn’t obvious he was doing what he was doing with the bathrobe and the massage and the pot plant. The pot plant!”Such as? “About their sexuality, how they see us, exactly what they want. It’s a really tricky discussion but I don’t know how we move forward without engaging men. And you can’t hate them if you’re trying to do that.” A pause, another grimace: scepticism made flesh. “Also: they’re nice. I know some really lovely ones.”• Colette is released on 12 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0eae29c599ac7f0f7b0c3d713777b7506eed5bc/87_49_2645_1586/master/2645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60281cd988a19f088ff665bde15d0b6d","title":"whats next for film criticism on the bbc barry norman","story":"After the long, slow death of the Beeb’s flagship Film show, a radical rethink is needed if the public broadcaster’s claims it takes movies seriously are to be believedFor the Film programme, it’s been a long goodbye. The BBC’s flagship film show for TV has been on its deathbed for a long time now. Running for only a few months a year, with a rotating and sometimes rather desultory-looking list of presenters, it has had a variable and very late time slot. Indeed, its own producers were sometimes left in the dark by BBC executives about what exactly was the plan for a programme that still had a devoted following.Its glory days, by common consent, were in the 70s, 80s and 90s when it was hosted by the avuncular, rumpled, lovable – and extremely knowledgable – Barry Norman, who like Michael Parkinson was part of a generation of presenters recruited from the ranks of print journalism. His catchphrase, invented for him by Spitting Image, caught the public imagination because it fitted Barry’s easygoing, open-minded attitude to criticism … “and why not?” Norman’s good-humoured and intelligent movie broadcasting was the introduction to film for generations of movie goers: the only uncomfortable thing about the long-running programme was the title. Take away the year and you’re not sure what to call it: Film … ? The Film programme? It’s said that the year you find yourself putting on it subconsciously reveals how young you believe yourself to be. I call it Film 91. I loved the show I loved Barry’s interviews with the stars, which came from an era before that in which actors were on autopilot for junket publicity tours. Barry had a wonderfully flirtatious encounter with Michelle Pfeiffer and a memorably frosty one with Robert De Niro. We all loved the genial way Barry would regularly hand over to Tom Brook for “industry” news from New York (Brook still presents BBC World News’s show Talking Movies).Then in the noughties, it was the more glamorous (and no less knowledgeable) figure of Jonathan Ross. After that, in 2010, it was Claudia Winkleman – an extremely smart arts presenter who like Ross included this gig with a portfolio of high-profile presenting jobs, but unlike Ross had to face regular misogynist condescension online. When Winkleman took over, the show had been re-thought in a more discussion-oriented approach, chatting with her regular resident critic Danny Leigh, and with guest reviewers. When she left in 2016, and you could feel the BBC taking its hands off the corporate steering wheel.The BBC has promised to replace Film with another show, but the challenge is how do you cover movies for a BBC One audience? The problem the BBC has is that movie broadcasting has been subject to a populist online revolution. There has been an explosion of podcasts and YouTube channels, many brilliant, and as in so many other areas of broadcasting, the BBC is wondering how to accommodate this new reality. Whatever happens, with either a single presenter, or a group format, it should be on all the year round, and in a non-insomniac slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58594002856a74e767d5f720f01bc113217dac3a/0_130_4530_2718/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae14dc03e9e937606f33794d8f5e58ef","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool arsenal oxlade chamberlain","story":"• ‘We’re doing better than we expected but no one is celebrating’• Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain training and could return this seasonJürgen Klopp has just had the best Christmas imaginable. Not only are Liverpool six points clear at the top of the Premier League but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is back in training. Yet, despite everything looking sunny at the halfway point of the season, the manager insists his side can improve.“I don’t think we have been seen at our very best yet,” Klopp said before Saturday’s visit of Arsenal. “We have had very good moments but overall we have not been as spectacular as we were at times last season. We don’t concede as often but people ask what has happened to the free-flowing football. It’s like a kid getting a nice present for Christmas then asking where’s the other one. You can’t always have everything sometimes it is best to be grateful for what you’ve got.“People will always want more but we had to develop from last season, to step aside a little and start again. We had to score a lot of goals last season because we conceded so many but we have worked on our defending since and I am pleased with the result.“I loved the way we played against PSG and Napoli, for example. Faced with strong opponents we still went for them. You cannot play like that against everybody – when we came to play Manchester City we had to be careful not to give anything away in case they hit us on the counter – but sometimes a team comes along, like Chelsea, and you know that both sides are going to go for it. That’s brilliant, I love games like that.”Pep Guardiola has just suggested Liverpool will begin to feel more pressure now they are out in front but Klopp feels it is still too early in the season for mind games and league tables. “I have to say 51 points at the halfway stage is better than we expected but no one is celebrating yet,” the Liverpool manager said. “The players are mature enough to know that. The time to get excited over a six-point lead is when there are only four or five games left to play.“I didn’t feel any different when I came in from the last game and someone told me the City result, and I certainly didn’t when I heard the Tottenham score. It is important to consider who is in the bunch of teams around you. We are in a good position but it’s silly to talk about points gained and lost when you have Arsenal next followed by City.”Klopp’s caution is understandable, though in each of the past three seasons he has seen the eventual champions emerge early and build up an unassailable lead. “That is true but those champions never had City at their back or a Tottenham side growing stronger every year,” he said. “When I came to England Harry Kane was 21 or 22, Dele Alli was just a kid from the lower leagues. It was a completely different situation to the one at present.”Even though City have lost three of their past four league matches and Tottenham have still to come to Anfield Klopp refuses to acknowledge that the title is Liverpool’s to lose – a footballing cliche he greets with a slight grimace – insisting instead that the best way for his side to keep up their unbeaten record is to keep concentrating on the next match.“We are not the hunters who have turned into the hunted. We are just a football team trying to play the best season of our lives,” he said. “Although actually that was the plan last season as well. We have brought in some fantastic players and created an atmosphere here where we believe in our own ability. We can handle difficult situations. We learn and go again.“I know some of his players very well indeed, particularly Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He is an outstanding player and a proper goalscorer who can do a lot of damage. He has a pretty rare combination of speed and finishing skill, and on top of that he’s good at heading. It all adds up to a pretty nice package.”But the prospect of meeting up with a former Borussia Dortmund player does not animate Klopp as much as the anticipated return of Oxlade-Chamberlain. The Liverpool manager was distraught when the midfielder damaged knee ligaments in last season’s Champions League semi-final and, though prepared to be without him for the whole of this season, is now being told the player could be ready in February or March.“That would be the best, best news,” Klopp said. “He started back and from the first step he took it looked completely normal. Right away it looked like Ox and that was really nice. Then we had to wait for the reaction – and there was no reaction, which is even nicer.“I don’t want to pre-empt the medical department but we now have hope he will be back this season. It actually looks like he could play tomorrow, though of course we will not be doing that. There is a long way to go but it looks good. It is a boost for the whole dressing room because Ox is such an important part of that and it’s great to have him around with a smile on his face.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf80839432ad36ce1e6fadbbfcc4098b319c0be2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4dcdd3324d97da2b8102639e606fe7","title":"pierre emerick aubamayeng","story":"The Arsenal striker has a claim to be the most thrillingly old-fashioned centre-forward in the Premier LeagueOK, but apart from that. Apart from scoring more goals in the last three and a half seasons than anyone else we have seen in England. Apart from being the Premier League top scorer in a new-build team still trying to work out their rhythm and shape. And apart from doing all this with a thrillingly controlled range of movement, that easy grace that scarcely leaves a dent in the dew. Apart from all that. What has Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang actually done to commend himself as the deadliest, most thrillingly old-school centre-forward in the Premier League?It is normal to have reservations about Aubameyang. People often do. As Arsenal have begun to stutter a little, with Saturday’s trip to Anfield looking like a chance to measure the distance this team still has left to run, there will be a temptation to question everything.Perhaps Aubameyang could have put away an even greater percentage of his chances. Perhaps he could mask the clanks and clunks of the new era a little more effectively, pulling out that fun, goofy grin more often, the look of a man who celebrates every single goal he scores as though this is the greatest, most unexpected thing that has ever happened to him, as though he simply had no idea such things were even possible.Either way Aubameyang is likely to enter the new year as the league’s top scorer. And as ever there is a vague sense of surprise about this. It isn’t hard to see why he confuses people. Football is a crowded, structurally baroque thing, a mess of noise and duelling metrics, tangled headphone chords, yellowing cheese board remnants, triple-screening evenings on the sofa arguing about expected goals with a parody Jeremy Corbyn Twitter account.In the middle of which there is a clarity to watching a player like Aubameyang. His outline is distinct. At a time of postmodern positional fudge, Aubameyang remains a pure cutting edge. No one in any major European league has more goals from fewer shots. No player has made fewer interceptions and scored more goals.It is a minimalism that can be both devastating and amusingly peripheral. Against Chelsea in August Aubameyang played for 90 minutes and touched the ball 18 times. Three months later in the win against Spurs he produced the most ruthlessly destructive inidual performance of the season, with 44 touches, two goals, an assist, five tackles, nothing wasted, nothing thrown away.He even won two headers, this from a man who still grins manically when he successfully heads the ball, and who is even now – whisper it – on a run of three whole games without committing a foul, being flagged offside or making a tackle.This is nothing new. There is some YouTube footage out there of Aubameyang’s first goal against an English team in the colours of Milan at the one-off World Youth Championships in Malaysia in 2007. Even this is pure one-touch killer, a run off the back of the Arsenal defence and a dreamy one-touch no-look instep volley yawned over the keeper with a flex of the big toe, not breaking stride, just running off to laugh about how good he is.Milan still didn’t sign him. To date the only teams to have spent any money on this wonderfully smooth goalscoring machine are St Étienne, Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund, who got rid of him in part because their own measures suggested he was doing less, moving less, carrying out the team plan to a less exacting degree.This is a part of the Aubameyang paradox. He is both a modern footballing athlete and a throwback to pre-Premier League times. In the age of 4-4-2 there were two main types of centre forward. First the classical Big Man, present now most obviously in the shape of Andy Carroll, who in his better moments can still replicate the destructive effects of hurling an aggressively confused wild yak from a second floor balcony into a Christmas market shopping street. And secondly the fast, smooth, LinekerAubameyang type, who made good runs and finished well and played right at the front of the team.A cutting edge this sharp is still supremely effective. Aubameyang has nine Premier League away goals in 2018. His goals in tight games have been responsible for 12 league points so far this season. Plenty of Arsenal fans prefer the more aggressively involved Alexandre Lacazette. Others have twigged that Mesut Özil, ine imperial princeling of the late Wenger years, cannot really play in the same team. One minimalist is fine. Two looks like decadence.Plus, the game has not changed that much. Perhaps the main thing that has gone wrong with Manchester City in the last month is just that their own killer up front has been injured or out of form. For all the talk of opponents wising up to the high press, of the loss of Fernandinho’s rapid transitions, these narratives are often engineered out of some fairly arbitrary details, games won or lost by fine margins. Stick Aubameyang in that City team for the last four games and they would probably end up winning all of them, albeit in a way that reflects little additional glory on the evolution of third-season Pep-ball.That slightly aloof style does not really fit any obvious philosophy or pattern of play. But it is still foolish to overlook the most obvious route to goal, or the power of the minimalist, who might not be the best or the most complete, but who has a particular kind of beauty in his cold clear lines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ef7663e3e38ed718f005496800a02bda91aeef/254_437_2058_1235/master/2058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=459d9bc80a1f0429989ab38a830cfe2e","title":"coco khan on making new friends as adult","story":"It’s one of life’s great mysteries, and trying is my resolution for 2019One of the quirks of living in London is the frequency with which people you know disappear: here one minute, gone the next. They came for work and left again, either exhausted, bored or rich. Over the years, I’ve said goodbye to many loved ones who headed “home”, or reverse-Brexited to the continent looking for champagne cosmopolitanism at lemonade prices.But, painful as that was, I always had friends from my east London school – the ones who, like me, had city roots that ran too deep to think about leaving.Until now. Next year, our band of seven becomes four, as three trade in the Big Smoke for the dream of Big Healthy Lungs. One’s off to the Midlands, another to Eastbourne and the third Down Under.“The thing about London,” the Aussie-in-waiting says, “is that unless you’re absolutely loaded, you’ll always be a little fish, waiting to become some shark’s dinner.”Is it better to be a big fish in a small pond? It’s a question that’s been weighing on my mind, and though I don’t yet know the answer, one thing’s for sure: wherever I am in this great ocean we call life, I will need to replenish my stock of friends.How do you make friends as an adult? It’s one of life’s great mysteries, and trying is my resolution for 2019. It feels wrong, somehow, to replace such long-loved friends, a betrayal to suggest they could ever be matched a show of disloyalty to our shared experience. Though I’ve come to accept that sometimes people part even when no bad blood has been spilled.“Well, if it’s people you need, London’s the right place,” the Bondi bestie says. “Let’s just say there are plenty more fish in the sea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4e73967a8d2c1169b2441d48de81822b5f66b0a/0_162_3322_1993/master/3322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e1db138ee3a3cffee3b816e30adcfa8","title":"jade bird i dont want a man telling me how to write my feelings","story":"With her fiery pop-Americana, the singer-songwriter is determined to make a name for herself in 2019 – all on her own termsRuins, the first song on Jade Bird’s forthcoming debut album, is a dubious introduction. Her voice is there, with its empathetic, rusty snag, buoyed by acoustic guitar. But then she belts: “I’m not sure who I think I am.” It is not an impression you leave with after an hour with the 21-year-old, nor after hearing her releases so far: rollicking Americana that, over an EP and some singles, has become ever more combustible – see Love Has All Been Done Before, her jubilant riposte to romance’s tired tropes.She feels a greater kinship with American songwriters such as Gillian Welch and Julien Baker than putative British forebear Jake Bugg, who famously railed against manufactured pop while employing blue-chip songwriters. Bird plays guitar and writes everything. “I didn’t fucking wanna do co-writes,” she shrugs, blasting personality into a sterile meeting room. “I write great songs and the mistakes make them even better. No one else could write a Morrissey song. I don’t want a middle-aged white man telling me how to write my feelings. It’s not gonna work for me.”Her unshakeable confidence is striking given a potentially destabilising childhood. Her young parents were in the army, taking the family from Northumberland to London and Germany by the time she was five. Her dad was stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo her mum left the army and cleaned cinemas. Her dad walked out when Bird was seven, so she and her mum moved in with her grandma – whose husband had also left her – in Bridgend in south Wales. That affected Bird more than moving. “My parents split, my grandparents split, and I’m like: ‘Don’t settle too quick, ’cos you might have to pick up your bags and go somewhere else.’”Her mum was treated poorly by subsequent men, “and that’s hard to watch as a kid,” says Bird, declining to clarify “because I don’t want to be defined by that. People like to associate you with hard times and I pride myself on coming through them more than experiencing them.” That is where music entered, as “the source of escape for these bad feelings”. Bird, 13, took her grandma’s discarded hobby guitar to her and her mum’s new house and spent hours “obsessively trying to get these barre chords down”.She didn’t discover Americana from her parents’ record collection – they were ardent ravers. Instead, she found the Civil Wars via the fantastically awful country soap Nashville, and started writing and performing at open mic nights in Bridgend. “But you have to get out if you want more,” she says. “And I did.” She was rejected from the Brit school, but dealt with it “like I deal with any rejection: I don’t. I keep whacking my head against the wall.”On her second attempt, she got in. Leaving Bridgend made sense for everyone: her mum’s new partner also lived in London. Bird started gigging three or four times a week around school. “I was always the sniffly kid with bags under my eyes,” she says. “I was so aware that I’m in London, I’ve got a guitar, I’m nothing special yet and I need to get there, so I just gigged, gigged, gigged.” Just as she was despairing about going undiscovered, begrudgingly contemplating university, a lawyer spotted her. They started meeting managers, most of whom (bar her current one) didn’t get it. Look back on the decade’s tips lists and the primary British guitarists are lads with big attitudes (and increasingly few of them).“I think the Americana thing was offputting,” says Bird. “I spent a lot of the conversations being like: ‘But why not?’ And they’re like: ‘Because it doesn’t work.’ But that’s a good thing! If it hasn’t been the formula, I wanna create the formula.”That tussle between ambition and integrity “really bugged me for a really long time,” she says. “Am I in this to be famous, for followers? And I realised, no, I really want to make something great. Whether it’s my first or my fifth album, I wanna keep giving that a go and almost die trying.” She distinguishes between ego (“the death of music”) and conviction: “It’s important we know the difference between me, ‘I’, and my art form.” Her ambitions are to keep improving, to make art – such as Kate Bush’s Cloudbusting and Patti Smith’s poetry – that defeats streaming-induced passivity.Her self-titled debut is appropriately bold. Its 12 polished tracks shift between barn-burners, wry acoustic jangle and affecting piano ballads. Her protagonists are often jilting women or foolish men being lured away by (occasionally two-dimensional) temptresses. “With my grandma and mum, the man’s always been the idiot, so that’s why,” she says. She’s not intending to shame anyone. “I love the way you can paint a picture so vividly by incorporating the seedy.”And yet she is proudest of having written half the songs while being in love – she is in her first happy relationship, with her guitarist. Hence that line in Ruins about not being sure who she is: she always thought unhappiness was integral to songwriting. She is learning that her family’s relationships needn’t define her. “It doesn’t mean that mine will end the same.”Bird is already thinking about album two, which might reflect her newfound riot grrrl obsession. “You can’t help but feel angry now and I’d love to be able to put that frustration in the music,” she says. But not the lyrics. “I’ve really struggled to do that because it never feels genuine. When everything’s fucked, what do you write about?” She is aware of another political pressure on young, female artists – namely to be a feminist icon, and how easily it can become vapid branding. “I’m not sure how to do anything but what I’m doing because what I’m doing is feminism,” she says. “I’m a young, independent girl and hopefully an example. You don’t need to wear a hashtag T-shirt.”As a woman, she says: “It’s really interesting to confront the same expectations as white male guitarists and exceed them. That’s my biggest goal, to keep smashing expectations. When people are like, oh, you’re country? Well, here’s an indie rock song. Now it’s punk, and I know what I’m talking about. It’s always been so important for me to be respected over being heralded.” Bird’s tornado of personality, redoubtable conviction and sterling debut suggest the choice won’t be an issue."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c20d56b182f1b55611210b45737a5a84faa6c11/0_134_3248_1948/master/3248.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c989f68af3a655045ecfef440b3c5e4","title":"pious plonker or misunderstood do gooder why we should all lay off bono","story":"It’s easy to stick the boot in to the U2 frontman’s grating form of activism but at his core isn’t he just trying to do the right thing?First things first. It’s somewhere beyond obvious that it would be preferable if U2 had not moved some part of their business to the Netherlands in order to avoid paying tax on royalties in Ireland. It would be significantly better for what I am about to write if Bono had not been named in the Paradise Papers for engaging in a (wholly legal) investment in a Lithuanian shopping centre, via the tax haven that is Malta. In fact, there are about a million things Bono could do that would make it easier to stick up for him. He could make the many and varied charities he is involved in devote more of their resources to aid than to the sometimes nebulous concept of “raising consciousness”. He could perhaps not describe those working in the aid sector as “cranks carping from the sidelines” when they raise concerns about the practical problems of his campaigns bypassing African entrepreneurs to work directly with assorted kleptocracies.Above all, he could stop being quite so pious all the time. He could stop making his own good deeds seem like something the rest of us should aspire to, because it makes people resent him all the more. But, blimey, I felt sorry for him this week after he and The Edge took part in an annual charity event in Dublin, busking for the homeless. Just type Bono and hypocrite into Twitter and see the stream of bile emerge. Damian Rice and Glen Hansard, who also participated, didn’t get it in the neck for daring to ask people for money for the homeless. Just Bono.The problem for Bono is that once you align yourself so publicly with the side of social justice, people – unreasonably, perhaps – demand perfection. And if you happen to be the singer of a rock’n’roll band while aligning yourself publicly with social justice, people also expect you to be a revolutionary, rather than someone who employs diligent tax advisers. But anyone who participates in capitalist economies ceases to be perfect with respect to social justice: pretty much all of us have treasured possessions whose existence is contingent on the exploitation of labour. Pretty much of all of us are the beneficiaries in some way of some awful degradation of the world. Those of us who work for ourselves ask financial experts to find some way to minimise our tax exposure: can we offset some of our utility bills, our phone bills and so on? We don’t go to the Inland Revenue offering them our bank accounts and a suggestion they take what they want.Instead we make trade-offs. Buy a pair of trainers made in some appalling factory in east Asia but feel happy we have a direct debit to a child poverty charity. Eat some crappy burger from a takeaway, but buy some organic veg from the shop. Maybe it’s worth thinking of Bono as living life in some hugely inflated scale of that. The shabby things U2 and Bono do (and which are, one can be sure, far from unique among the super-rich of music) are balanced in the ledger against the worthwhile things.Let’s not forget that the list of worthwhile things Bono and U2 have done over their career – whether or not you like their music, whether or not you think Bono is an arse – far outstrips what the vast majority of their contemporaries do. He has campaigned for debt relief. Not just by shouting slogans from a stage, but by engaging with the right to persuade them to the cause. He has campaigned for Aids awareness. He has set up fairtrade companies. He has toured for Amnesty. He’s supported, variously, Chernobyl Children International, the Clinton Global Initiative, Every Mother Counts, Keep a Child Alive, Make Poverty History, Millennium Villages, Not On Our Watch, the Red Cross, the Lunchbox Fund, Unicef, War Child, Water.org, Witness and more (according to Inside Philanthropy). He’s helped establish three different campaigning organisations: Red, One and DATA (Debt, Aids, Trade, Africa). This is not an insignificant list. It speaks of serious and genuine commitment.The sad thing is that if he had just sat on his backside in his mansion counting his money, mumbling the odd platitude in interviews, but never doing anything, no one would care. His views on social activism would be unworthy of comment. No one would complain about his hypocrisy, criticise U2’s tax arrangements, or sneer at him for busking for the homeless. Everyone would just assume it was business as usual for a rock star, and not raise an eyebrow. But once you try to be good, you can never be good enough.That strikes me as a terrible shame. It’s not that I want the world to hail Bono – I feel no great urge to do so myself – but I don’t understand the visceral reaction that causes people to look for excuses to despise him. Sure, pull him up when he missteps. But why pull him up when he’s sincerely trying to do the right thing? Unless people really would prefer stars who think the world is worthy neither of engagement nor improvement. In which case, that’s your loss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b21a1ffff09756640289e3c71b3efe8846bc56b8/0_0_3984_2648/master/3984.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8320545bcb9880d6ea93b9ee25b4a041 880w","title":"tell us how are you preparing for a no deal brexit","story":"As the government announces troops will be on standby we want to hear from readers preparing for a no-deal BrexitThe government has agreed to implement no-deal Brexit plans “in full” as it seeks to allay fears by saying 3,500 troops would be on standby to help in event of any crisis.Some 80,000 emails are going out to businesses and business groups this week with advice about no-deal planning, but what about people at home?Earlier this year we heard from readers who were planning to stockpile food after warnings came from the National Farmers Union and the British Retail Consortium.

The party said in a statement that she should quit as MP for Peterborough.But, writing in the Peterborough , she said constituents should “rest assured” that she would remain their representative fighting injustice in the corridors of power.Under parliamentary rules, Onasanya would lose her seat in the Commons only if she is jailed for 12 months or more at her sentencing, expected next month.In the article – headlined I will continue to fight against injustices – the MP made no mention of her 19 December conviction for lying to police to avoid a speeding charge.Instead, the 35-year-old solicitor provided a recap of her involvement in events at Westminster over the past year, including battles over Brexit, universal credit and austerity, as well as local controversies about working conditions at an Amazon warehouse and the planned closure of a tax office.“It’s an honour to be your voice for change over an incredibly consequential period of British politics,” said Onasanya.And she pledged: “While it has been a successful year fighting back against these injustices, there is still much more to be done, and you can rest assured that I will continue to do so as your representative in the corridors of power.”The paper’s editor, Mark Edwards, said he had been asked why the  was continuing to print Onasanya’s column following her conviction.“While she is still the MP – and therefore the elected representative – we believe it would be wrong to deny our readers the chance to read what she has submitted,” he said.“To censor the column would, in my view, be wrong, and in my experience our readers are quite capable of making their own minds up about the columns submitted by local politicians.”Shortly after her conviction, Onasanya compared her position to that of biblical figures Joseph, Moses and Daniel who “were each found guilty by the courts of their day”.And in a WhatsApp message to Labour colleagues, she added that Jesus “was accused and convicted by the courts of his day and yet this was not his end but rather the beginning of the next chapter in his story”.If she does resign or lose her seat, Labour will face a tough fight to hold on to Peterborough, which it seized from the Tories by a wafer-thin margin of 607 in 2017."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d6569f09e651bfdbc32b0c976aec73e54ab159/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b143286389fda60ad4f9711017cf6083","title":"recall mps from holiday to vote on mays brexit deal says corbyn","story":"Labour leader accuses prime minister of cynical move to ‘run down the clock’Jeremy Corbyn has called for the House of Commons to be recalled early from its Christmas break to allow MPs to vote on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Parliament is not due to reconvene until 7 January, with the postponed vote on the prime minister’s deal expected to take place in the week after that.In an interview with the i newspaper, Corbyn suggested May should bring MPs back early. “Well, it is in her hands to recall parliament. I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it,” he said.He accused May of a “completely cynical manoeuvre” to “run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea”.Before parliament’s Christmas recess, Corbyn did not join those MPs, including the Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and Conservative Justine Greening, calling for recess to be cancelled or curtailed so the vote could go ahead.And he has continued to resist intense pressure from Labour activists to shift the party’s position towards backing a second Brexit referendum.Corbyn sparked a backlash this month by restating in a  interview that the party’s position was to seek to go back to Brussels and renegotiate a better Brexit deal, rather than try to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote.

If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Separately, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who has seemed more sympathetic to a second referendum than his longtime collaborator, told the Financial Times he did not favour “indicative votes” to unblock the deadlock in parliament.Some members of May’s cabinet, including the education secretary, Damian Hinds, have suggested MPs could be presented with a series of propositions – such as a Norway-style deal and a second referendum – in an attempt to whittle down the options.Downing Street is not keen on the proposal but has not rejected the idea outright, as a way of trying to break the logjam if May’s deal is rejected by MPs next month.However, the idea appears unlikely to win the backing of Labour. The shadow chancellor told the FT: “The idea of indicative votes is just to run the clock down even further towards March 29. People aren’t that gullible. They’ve seen through that.”MPs will return to Westminster braced for a momentous three months and with no clear idea of what will happen if May’s deal is rejected.The Democratic Unionist party is awaiting word from the prime minister about whether she has secured the fresh reassurances on the Irish border its MPs say they need to support the withdrawal agreement.Downing Street hopes if they can be won over, enough Brexit-backing Conservatives might follow to help her win a majority in the Commons but the parliamentary arithmetic looked very bleak before Christmas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a83985a58bd3286e296b449a6bc8c731e1ef30a4/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b59574e38d25bef06e30841dc677fa","title":"19 for 19 unmissable sporting events to mark in your diary","story":"World cups will feature prominently in what promises to be a spectacular sporting yearMore than 7,000 athletes from 170 nations are due to compete at the largest multi-sport event for people with intellectual disabilities and one which in 2019 celebrates its 50th anniversary.

Having home advantage certainly helps their cause but it would be foolish to rule out the threat posed by teams such as India, who are just behind England in the ICC’s one-day rankings, and Australia, who have won four of the past five World Cups.The biggest fixture in European football takes place at the Estadio politano, the home of Atlético Madrid. Their city rivals Real are the current holders but have been in patchy form this season so look ripe for a serious challenge to their crown, and for the first time in seven years it could well be an English side who take the glory. The Premier League has four representatives in the knockout stage with two in particular, Manchester City and Liverpool, appearing to have the quality and strength-in-depth to go all the way.A competition that was met with scepticism and cynicism proved a notable success in 2018 and for England has led to genuine hope of winning a trophy. Gareth Southgate’s side face the Netherlands in their semi-final in Guimarães on 6 June and, should they win, they would face either the hosts, Portugal, or Switzerland in the final in Porto three days later. Defeat to the Dutch would mean England taking part in a third-place play-off.The eighth edition of the competition is to be staged in France for the first time. Twenty-four teams will compete across nine cities, all hoping to reach the final in Lyon 7 July. Among them are England, who have enjoyed an encouraging year under Phil Neville, winning seven out of 12 fixtures, including a 4-1 triumph over France in the former Manchester United defender’s first game in charge. The team to beat remains the USA, however, who won the competition in Canada four years ago and are ranked No 1 in the world.Africa’s biennial international tournament moves to the summer for the first time. It has also expanded from 16 to 24 competing nations. The only thing needed now is a host. The Confederation of African Football stripped the reigning champions, Cameroon, of the right to do so in November because of concerns over its infrastructure. Egypt and South Africa have submitted bids to step in with a final decision to be made by Caf’s executive committee on 9 January.The Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees go head to head in what will be a historic contest – the first time teams from MLB compete on European soil. The Red Sox and the Yankees, who have 36 World Series titles between them, will face each other twice in consecutive days at the home of West Ham United, with officials at the MLB hoping the event will prove popular enough for the sport to establish a “long-term footprint” in London.2018’s Wimbledon passed by almost completely without notice because of a combination of Andy Murray’s absence through injury and England’s exploits at the World Cup. This summer there will be no blaring of Three Lions across pub gardens and, crucially, Murray should be back in action. Johanna Konta will also be hoping to make a mark having last exited in the second round. And then there will be players such as Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Simona Halep and Serena Williams to help bring in the crowds.The sense of fascination around cycling’s premier event will be heightened by the fact it is to be Team Sky’s last. The target for Sir Dave Brailsford and co will be to go out on a high by winning the general classification for a fifth year in a row following Chris Froome’s triple triumph and this year’s surprise victory by Geraint Thomas. Elsewhere it will be intriguing to see if Peter Sagan and Julian Alaphilippe can follow up on their triumphs at this year’s Tour, when they won the green and polka dot jersey respectively.Sixteen teams will take part in the 15th edition of netball’s premier competition, with all matches to be staged at the 11,000-seat Echo Arena. England play their first match on the opening day, against Uganda, and the ambition of Tracey Neville’s side will be to go all the way following their gold medal success at this year’s Commonwealth Games. However, having won the past seven World Cups, Australia remain the team to beat. Their first match is also on the opening day, against Northern Ireland.Gwangju - the “city of peace” - is to stage world aquatics’ premier event. Thirty nations will compete in the pool, in events including swimming, ing and water polo, and for Great Britain the ambition is to improve on the 11 medals, five of which were gold, that they achieved at the 2017 world championships in Budapest. Adam Peaty, the 100m breaststroke champion, and Grace Reid, who took silver in the mixed 3m synchronised springboard alongside Tom Daley, are among those expected to do well again.For the first time since 1951, Royal Portrush will host golf’s oldest major. It will also be the first time since then that the competition has not taken place in Great Britain. Francesco Molinari will arrive as the reigning champion and is sure to expect a tough challenge from Brooks Koepka, Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day.Edgbaston, Lord’s, Headingley, Old Trafford and the Oval will play host as England’s men look to make up for the 4-0 shellacking they suffered in Australia last time out. Should Joe Root’s men be triumphant, they could also find themselves lifting the urn as leaves are falling from the trees such is the late finish of this series. For Australia, there could be a return to Ashes battle for Steve Smith and David Warner following their bans for ball tampering. Earlier the respective women’s sides face each other, with a one-off four-day Test match taking place at Taunton in between three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 fixtures.The ninth edition of rugby union’s premier global tournament takes place in Asia for a first time. Reigning champions New Zealand will arrive as favourites but as their recent defeat to Ireland showed, the All Blacks can be rattled. Joe Schmidt’s side look best equipped of the northern hemisphere sides to go all the way and will certainly fancy their chances of progressing from a group containing Scotland, Japan, Russia and Samoa. England, meanwhile, find themselves in a tough group featuring France and Argentina.Qatar hosts the 17th edition of athletics’ most prestigious event outside of the Olympics, something that has been condemned by human rights activists as well as by some athletes because of the extreme heat they will have to perform in. Once the action gets going, the focus will be on seeing which global stars rise to the challenge, among them the United States sprinter Christian Coleman, Kenya’s middle-distance runner Faith Kipyegon and, from a British perspective, Dina Asher-Smith and Zharnel Hughes, both of whom won gold at the European Championships in Berlin.The chance to once again see Enable, the outstanding thoroughbred on these shores, will be of huge interest to all racing aficionados. Her date with destiny is the first Sunday in October at Longchamp when she will attempt to become the first triple winner of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. Frankie Dettori on board is very much an added bonus. Elsewhere in 2019, the vintage two-year-old crop consisting of Too Darn Hot, Ten Sovereigns, Calyx and Quorto are set to clash in the 2,000 Guineas in May, while over jumps Cheltenham will take centre stage in March and the Grand National in April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1210cca8c5b52dfc552594322607e20da86309/0_0_4281_2568/master/4281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c7e592e5cc31d586155b361b0cce958","title":"guardian footballer of the year 2018 khadija bunny shaw","story":" Footballer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Khadija “Bunny” Shaw is our third winner following Fabio Pisacane in 2016 and Juan Mata in 2017. There is a warmth and gentle magnetism about Khadija “Bunny” Shaw that is immediate and fills the room, a personality as towering as the nearly 6ft frame that pounded in one goal after another during a breathless year of double duty for Jamaica and the University of Tennessee.She has just finished the last of her final exams when we meet on the school’s sprawling Knoxville campus, where the senior communications major is on track to graduate in the spring and become the first member of her family to earn a degree from an American university. For now, a plane ride home and a well-earned break is afoot.Life, in short, is good for the ’s footballer of the year for 2018, a one-time teenage prodigy turned lethal 21-year-old striker who delivered on her long-held promise in powering the Reggae Girlz into their first Women’s World Cup and the Lady Volunteers to the best season in their history.Born\u0026nbsp31 January 1997 in Spanish Town, JamaicaCareer\u0026nbspMade 35 appearances for the University of Tennessee, scoring 27 goals and setting the all-time school record for goals per game (0.77)International appearances\u0026nbsp11 caps for Jamaica, 9 goals\u0026nbspCareer high\u0026nbspScored three goals in five appearances at the Concacaf Women’s Championship 2018, including the opener in the climactic 2-2 draw with Panama that was settled by a penalty shootout, to help Jamaica become the first ever Caribbean nation to qualify for the Fifa Women’s World CupThe accomplishments on their face are remarkable enough. But the breadth of Shaw’s achievement is nothing short of extraordinary given the unspeakable personal tragedy she has overcome along the way, losing four brothers – three of them to gang-related violence – in a short period of time.Shaw grew up alongside seven brothers and five sisters in Spanish Town, the gritty former Jamaican capital on the western outskirts of Kingston, the youngest child of George, a shoemaker, and Monica, a poultry farmer who raised chickens. She recalls in vivid detail a picture-book upbringing – neighbours playing dominos on the corner, music echoing down the sidewalks, children kicking the ball about in the streets – largely sheltered from the ever-looming threat of gang violence that reached a grim peak during her childhood. Through the good and the bad, Shaw’s parents held the family together.“It s a struggle growing up, to grow up in such an environment and see how they persevered, what motivated them to want to motivate me,” she says. “Literally sometimes I don’t know how they did what they did, but they managed to get it done.”A prominent set of front teeth and a prodigious appetite for carrots inspired Shaw’s brother, Kentardo, to coin her leporine nickname, which she loathed at first until she “grew into it”. She made the three-minute walk from the family house to her primary school with her father every day and enjoyed her classes – especially social studies.After school, Shaw would return home and watch her older brothers kick the ball around in the street in front of the house before they headed to a nearby field for practice. Monica forbade Bunny from joining in, wary of her youngest daughter spending too much time on a sport thought to be too rough for girls. Eventually, Shaw coaxed an introductory lesson from Kentardo, who told her she had to start by juggling the ball. “That was one of the hardest things to do, because you got to learn to keep the ball up,” she recalls. “I would kick it up and then let it bounce and I would count, count, count. And I would try to go to two and I would try to go to three. He was like the more technical you are, the better you are playing on a soccer field, because the less technical you are, there are certain things you can’t do on the soccer field.”Over time Shaw’s mother relented and allowed Bunny to play with the boys in front of the house, where her innate speed, touch and creative flair earned her a measure of notoriety. Word spread around the parish and beyond. Then one day Monica received a phone call from Vin Blaine, the Jamaica Football Federation’s director of football, who wanted to invite the precocious seventh-grader to a national team camp.“That’s when my mum was like: ‘OK! You go play! Go to the soccer field!’” Shaw recalls with a laugh. “That’s when I got more involved because at my school, I was the best player. But then when I went to the camp there were players like me.”From there Shaw’s development accelerated and her ascent was rapid. She played in Jamaica’s under-15, under-17 and under-20 teams at the age of 14, coming up alongside present-day teammates Konya Plummer and Deneisha Blackwood. But it was not until the scholarship offers from American universities began pouring in around 11th grade that Shaw viewed football as a career path.After navigating her options with the head coach of Jamaica’s national team, Shaw gave a verbal commitment to play for the University of Florida but, after missing the date of the SAT college entrance exam, spent two years playing in junior college, where she was spotted and recruited by the Tennessee coach, Brian Pensky. The adjustment to American life was tough at times, not least because she has yet to find a place that makes her beloved jerk chicken like the corner spots back home.“You got to just be in the environment and see for itself,” she says. “I knew America was a big place for me in terms of the capacity. And I know it was pretty from what people would say. And I know it’s just way more organised from back home. Sometimes, there are some things that are unexplainable.”Yet as Shaw came of age and flourished on the pitch in the United States, an unfathomable streak of misfortune took hold of her family in Spanish Town. Gang-related gun violence took the lives of three of her brothers. A fourth was taken in a fatal car accident. Then while attending Eastern Florida State College in 2016, Shaw lost two nephews in quick succession: one to a gunshot, the other when he was electrocuted on a football field.The accumulation of grief rocked the tight-knit family and put Bunny’s indefatigable spirit to the test in previously unthinkable ways. Alone in a foreign land, she considered quitting the sport entirely.“I wanted to go home,” Shaw says. “I didn’t want to play soccer. And it was just hard because you lost four and then you come back again and lose two nephews. It’s just like: ‘What more to come? I want to go home because I didn’t get to say goodbye to them and now they’re gone.’ They say you’re not supposed to ask God why, but sometimes I would be like: ‘Why? Why did this happen?’“I would say it definitely got me stronger. And even though it was a rough time, it helped me. You know, in the moment I wouldn’t have thought that. But now, to see what I’ve accomplished, knowing I’ve lost so much, I would say it definitely helped me. But it was rough. I couldn’t focus in school. I was just thinking about it all. And my mum would constantly call me. I would tell my family I want to come home and they’re like: ‘No, you’ve got to stay! You’ve got to make it better for yourself and better for us! So I was like: ‘All right, take a deep breath.’”“But I’ve learned, because it was hard, that you just got to look past it. You know it happens. Everything happens for a reason. It’s what’s happening now, that’s what I’ve got to focus on.”The uncommon blend of physicality, quickness and vision that sets Shaw apart and elevates her teammates has been on full display since her senior international debut in July before World Cup qualifying. She has answered the call with 11 goals in nine appearances, including the opener in the climactic 2-2 draw with Panama that went to a penalty shootout, where the Reggae Girlz punched their historic World Cup ticket.Shaw also finished with 13 goals in 15 appearances for Tennessee as they reached the last eight of the NCAA tournament for the first time, landing in the year-end top 10 of all three national rankings, another first for them. After graduation and next summer’s World Cup, she plans to pursue a professional career either in the United States or Europe. The sky is the limit and these days, after what she has gone through, there is every reason to smile. But even as her career soars to new heights, family remains the core of her support system – and the lessons passed down from her parents keep her grounded.“Remain humble, stay focused and just do the best you can,” she says. “They’ve been there from day one, even when people said: ‘Oh, soccer is a man’s sport.’ They never said maybe you should change your sport and play netball or volleyball. They’d always be like if that’s your dream, try and see if you can achieve your dream. They’ve been there even when we’ve lost games or didn’t make it to where we wanted to. They’d say OK, the next one. You’ll get it on the next one. So with them, having them behind me, pushing me, encouraging me, motivating me, that’s all I need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517069496e24f5223318092c74a78de078cf0e7/95_109_1810_1086/master/1810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca05cc6f769256566464721c03d12f3","title":"matt symons harlequins wasps","story":"The Harlequins lock is relishing playing against his former Wasps teammates in the Big GameRob Baxter summed up the dilemma of preparing a side to face Harlequins. “The trouble with facing teams who are patchy is that you do not know which patch you are going to hit,” Exeter’s head coach said a month ago. The Chiefs duly lost their unbeaten record at the Stoop a week after their hosts had been beaten at Worcester.Quins followed up the victory over last season’s beaten Premiership finalists by succumbing to Leicester, a side that had gone into the game at Welford Road on an eight-match losing streak. It portrayed the patchiness Baxter referred to: victories over two of the current top three have been supplemented by defeats to two of the bottom three, suggesting a side boasting a number of England internationals past and present is most motivated when taking on the best.Wasps started the round which marks the halfway point of the regular Premiership season in fourth place, but the only way the word best could be applied to the team that lost the 2016 Premiership final in the dying minutes is that in their last five league matches they have been bested four times, although they will be relieved to be at Twickenham for the Big Game as they have won only one of their last five league matches at the Stoop.“It is about being more consistent,” says the Harlequins second row, Matt Symons, who joined last summer from Wasps. “We win one week and lose the next. We need to find some away form and build on the good victories such as the one we had against Exeter.“I cannot put my finger on why we cannot back up a performance. We have had a long discussion about it and it is about performing when the pressure is on and riding the swings in momentum that happen during games.”Quins have not recorded consecutive league victories this season: they last did so in October last year when they had consecutive home matches. They are more consistent in front of their own supporters with their two league defeats at the Stoop this season, against Bath and Saracens, both by an unconverted try, but they are conceding that advantage by moving over the road for what will be a near sell-out.“I am loving my time here,” says the 29-year-old Symons, who started his professional career in New Zealand after failing to make it initially in England. “We are not near our potential yet and have a long way to go. When I signed for Harlequins, John Kingston was in charge and he sold me the vision of where the club was going. He has gone, as happens in professional sport, and Paul Gustard has taken over: nothing happens overnight and the Premiership is incredibly competitive. We speak about changing mindsets and if you keep working hard, you will crack the nut.“I have been happy with my start to the season while being aware that there are improvements I have to make. It will be my first Big Game but I have played at Twickenham before, against Wasps when I was with London Irish. It will be an awesome occasion against my former peers and I will be flying into it.”Symons has only been a professional player for five years. “I did not play for three years after I turned 18,” he says. “The system went against me and I was too small (he is now 6ft 7in and 18st 6lb). Saracens rejected me and I turned to rowing. I did the Olympic pathway programme but then got injured: I was picked in Great Britain’s under-23 squad but could not race because my arms kept blowing up. I had an operation but it did not work and I went back to rugby. I played for Esher and then decided to go to New Zealand for a few months.”Within a year of arriving in New Zealand, Symons was played provincial rugby for Canterbury and the following season was in the Chiefs’ Super Rugby squad. “Initially, I worked for the Earthquake Commission in Christchurch,” he says. “I was dealing with the fall-out, such as insurance claims. I was training a couple of days a week and playing on the Saturday before Canterbury called to see if I could be a bag holder at training. From there I went to the Chiefs before returning home to join London Irish. New Zealand was the best thing that happened to me.“I was in the leadership group at the Chiefs, the only non-All Black among the likes of Brodie Retallick, Sam Cane, Aaron Cruden and Liam Messam. What struck me was how calm they stayed in difficult situations, relaying clear and simple messages. It was a process-oriented approach rather than an emotional one and I learned a lot.“The beauty of the Kiwi system is that pathways are so quick compared to here where a number of very good players get lost in the Championship or National One. I was eligible to play for New Zealand through the visa system: I had conversations with the union – I am sure they talk to a lot of people – but if the opportunity had come I could not have justified wearing the jersey because I am English. I have enjoyed different experiences and want to build on them with half my career still to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec3e0ca083533c29d3fa33392c2f48664ac7c7d6/0_58_3274_1964/master/3274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4f562ffbbb5885123d98df576c897b6","title":"australia v india boxing day test day four live","story":"33rd over: Australia 116-3 (Head 17, M Marsh 2) There were boos as one Marsh left and another entered, a combination of annoyance at the DRS for the former and enduring antipathy that the younger man was picked ahead of Peter Handscomb. Mitch is off the mark with a couple first ball to midwicket, a useful way to get underway.Oooh, that’s stiff as the system comes. Marsh was given lbw by Umpire Erasmus to a delivery he missed on the inside edge, Bumrah coming round the wicket. It did plenty on the way, so he sent it up to the DRS, which showed the smallest portion of the ball making contact with leg stump. He really was in wonderful touch. That could, and maybe should, be the name of his autobiography one day.32nd over: Australia 114-3 (S Marsh 44, Head 17) Shooooooot! Shaun Marsh at his best, driving through extra cover first ball, a stroke with all the trimmings. He dances at the final Jadeja ball of the over, adjusting mid-stroke to cut through more. Here we go!31st over: Australia 105-3 (S Marsh 36, Head 16) Shaun Marsh has Bumrah’s measure for now as well, defending then ducking and digging a yorker out for a single that keeps the board ticking over for the hosts.30th over: Australia 104-3 (S Marsh 35, Head 16) The 100 is up! Just 300 to go! Sorry, I won’t keep doing that. Marsh brings up the team milestone with a beautiful lofted drive from the first ball, into the southern stand! Nice. With the fielder now back he takes the single on offer there with ease. He’s playing Jadeja perfectly. 29th over: Australia 95-3 (S Marsh 26, Head 16) Head is getting out the way of these Bumrah short balls but only just. The slower one comes but it isn’t on the mark, tucked away for one. Marsh has two balls to see off and they are up for caught behind from the first of them, down the legside. The ump, Erasmus, isn’t interested and the review doesn’t come. A single to cover means he keeps the strike as they take a drink. 28th over: Australia 93-3 (S Marsh 25, Head 15) Head for the third time in as many overs takes a run from Jadeja to third man, albeit along the ground. Marsh does the rest.27th over: Australia 92-3 (S Marsh 25, Head 14) Bumrah’s back and you’re gonna get in trouble, Hey-la-day-la Jas Bumrah’s back. The whole game changes with the big dog back from the MCC end, causing Head some serious concerns with a pair of nasty short balls. But the SA captain holds his nerve, clipping three to end the interrogation.“I know TV needs ad-money but in the UK every break is Ray bloody Winstone and bet365,” SImon Richards informs us. “Snooker ball in sock and “Who’s the Daddy now?” for the ad-bookers ! (“Scum” film 1979). Good test match though.”If you think it is bad on TV, check out the signs around the ground. Geoff and I went into a bit of depth about this on our pod after Perth. I don’t reckon I’ve seen a Test with more gambling advertising than the first two of this series. Not a good look at all.26th over: Australia 89-3 (S Marsh 25, Head 11) Head with soft hands picks up two from the outside half of the bat to begin, moving into double figures. He then finishes with a single out to cover. Jadeja is galloping through his overs, as he always does.  25th over: Australia 86-3 (S Marsh 25, Head 8) Three good overs in a row, Marsh ticking going really well here both in defence and then with a wonderful straight drive that races away for four. Virat, mate, get Ishant on right now. Shami is tired.A bit of news to hand, Cam Bancroft has been named in the Scorchers squad tomorrow night against the Hurricanes at York Park. 24th over: Australia 82-3 (S Marsh 21, Head 8)  Big overs back to back, Jadeja this time feasted on by the southpaw pair to the tune of ten runs. Granted, it began with a Head edge but it was followed by Marsh pushing nicely down the ground for three, the South Australian picking the gap at cover for a couple then slapping a lovely boundary in the same direction to finish. I haven’t got the TV commentary on now but I bet they are absolutely talking up the MCG miracle as I type.“Chuck your hypothetical selector’s hat on,” suggests Matt Harris. “Do they wear hats? I don’t know.” They bloody do as far as I am concerned. Please continue. “If Nathan Lyon were to retire tomorrow, who do you think is the most likely next permanent spinner in the Australian team? Ahmed too old? Ssschwepson? Zampa? Agar? Maxwell?”Probably Agar. Maybe Swepson. Holland in Australia. I bowl pretty handy leggies these days. But Nath is going to play until he is 40 and overtake Murali. 23rd over: Australia 72-3 (S Marsh 18, Head 1) Shami way off the mark this time around, Marsh clipping three, Head tucking one then Marsh glancing four. Time for a blow. How about this?! President Obama ON MY WAVELENGTH! (see earlier post)22nd over: Australia 64-3 (S Marsh 11, Head 0) Marsh takes Jadeja’s first ball to mid on and the race is on for Head to get down to the danger end in time, but the direct hit isn’t on. BIG SHOUT for caught behind, but the South Australian has played and missed at the one that doesn’t turn. An important hand for him after what happened yesterday.Oh, that’s very out. Beautiful bowling from Shami, round the wicket angling in then straightening at Khawaja, beating his squared-up blade. Hit on the back pad, there was little doubt where that ball was going: into middle and off. Australia are in more trouble than the early settlers. And they’ve blown a review.IS KHAWAJA LBW TO SHAMI? Umpire Erasmus says yes, but he’s sending it upstairs. Stand by. 20th over: Australia 63-2 (Khawaja 33, S Marsh 10) Khawaja sweeps the first of Jadeja’s new over, taking one. Marsh is looking alright in defence against the spin early in this session, using his feet to get to the pitch a couple of times.“Afternoon, Adam.” Hello Ian Forth. “Kohli has now declared twice in this match. Only two other captains have declared twice and lost: Graeme Smith at the SCG in 2008 and Garry Sobers against England in 1968, when he set an enigmatically low last innings target. The fact it was chased down by Geoff Boycott might tell you exactly how generous it was.” I like this statfact, it comes up a lot. At lunch I heard a TV commentator talking up an “MCG miracle” for Australia here. I guess keeping people interested is part of their job.19th over: Australia 62-2 (Khawaja 32, S Marsh 10) Shami gets one to take off at Khawaja early in the over, but he plays it well with a hand off the bat before turning a a single around the corner later in the set. Marsh has one ball to deal with but it is a misdirected bumper.18th over: Australia 61-2 (Khawaja 31, S Marsh 10) Jadeja to Marsh is a match up that he will fancy but he can’t break through his defence here, the left-hander picking up a couple to midwicket along the way to pop him into double figures! That’s not usually a big deal but for Marsh, getting out in single digits as often as he does, it should prompt a wave of the bat. But it won’t matter unless he’s there at tea and beyond.17th over: Australia 59-2 (Khawaja 31, S Marsh 8) Lovely cut from Khawaja, slamming Shami’s shorter ball past point and to the rope. Sure enough, India’s second innings specialist hits back with a lovely little away swinger from round the wicket, beating the outside edge. That’s not an easy ball to execute. To finish, he nearly finds a way under the number three’s blade with a fuller ball. Technology is suggesting on the replay that the ball that Khawaja missed might actually have been tickled. Lucky. 16th over: Australia 55-2 (Khawaja 27, Marsh 8) OUCH! Khawaja sweeps hard on the bounce to bad pad, hitting the turf and bouncing straight into Agarwal’s neck. The Indian physio spends a couple of minutes in the middle before taking the opener from the field for further inspection. There’s a shout for lbw after the resumption, Khawaja missing his reverse sweep, but Umpire Gould wants none of it. He keeps the strike with a push to midwicket. 15th over: Australia 54-2 (Khawaja 26, Marsh 8) Shami’s radar is off to begin, Marsh deflecting four leg byes off his hip then pulling a couple off the middle of the bat to bring up the Australian 50. That’ll do. Oooh, then one from Shaun’s top shelf, leaning into a stunning cover drive, “as good as we’ve seen in this Test” says Tim Lane on telly. The Indian quick finishes with an accurate bouncer but after ten runs have been taken.“My song of the year is this irresistible slice of pure funk,” writes Neil Weatherston Sharma. I’ll give it a blast. Thanks.The players are back on the field. I guess this could be Shaun Marsh’s final Test innings? I think he’ll be safe for Sydney but you never know. By contrast, how about a little bit of Usmania? The six he hit off Jadeja before lunch was delicious. He resumes on 26. Shami will start the Indian session from the Members End. PLAY! Sir Alastair Cook. I’m not much one for honours, but go you good thing. A note too for my old club chairman at Hampstead CC, Jim Carter. Despite being a bloody big deal on the TVbig screen, he was forever the last person on deck doing all the dirty work that makes a cricket club function. He’s picked up an OBE gong for his services to drama. Ending today, isn’t it? After batting for nearly two days, then having a second pop for a little bit, India are every chance to get this done in four. Let that sink in. When Australia were turned over by South Africa and England on this ground in 2008 and 2010, the response was close to a full-blown national catastrophe (we’re mad like that). This won’t necessarily prompt that, but it will mean WHOLESALE CHANGES for Sydney. To start at the top, Aaron Finch. He has played one late cut in his Test career and it landed in the hands of Virat Kohli. When the @CricProf tweeted that factoid, every other reply was “and it’ll be the last he plays” or jibes along those lines. I’m genuinely sad that it hasn’t worked out for him as he’s exactly the sort of personality they need in that dressing room in this prolonged state of flux, but that’s probably that for him.Who comes in? Joe Burns on form, one would think. Matt Renshaw hasn’t the numbers to justify inclusion in the Shield this season, but you have to wonder how different the world would be had they backed him in at Dubai. Might Justin Langer pick Cameron Bancroft? He’s available. It absolutely should not be ruled out. Or a Khawaja move? He opens over 100 opening the batting, on that blunt measure. We’ll know by tomorrow. Given the trajectory of the Test, this will almost certainly be my final OBO shift of 2018. So, please do keep me company with your emails and tweets. Have a real go leave it all on the park. I’ll leave you with my top song of the year. Send me your number one.Yes, that’s a distant victory target. And an equally distant five sessions to bat for a draw. As is often the case in these scenarios, you’d imagine that if they batted five sessions they would probably get those runs. But they’re unlikely to do either. Really it’s a matter of how much fight this Australian batting side can put up. Both openers are gone, the two senior players in Khawaja and Marsh are at the crease, and there’s not much to come. Khawaja is going hard and not seeming too bothered, which may only work for so long, and Marsh has poked tentatively as he does. Plenty of discussion around about what should happen with this dysfunctional Australian side for Sydney, in terms of selections. I’m sure Adam Collins will have no shortage of material on that. I’ll leave you with him, and if the Aussies can take us that far, will see you for the first session tomorrow.14th over: Australia 44-2 (Khawaja 26, S Marsh 2) Jadeja races through one last over before lunch. But instead of getting out from the last ball, Shaun Marsh taps a single through square leg, and survives. The task lies ahead of him after the sandwiches.13th over: Australia 43-2 (Khawaja 26, S Marsh 1) Lunch is approaching, so maybe Khawaja is going to chilllll, Winston. He blocks out a few against Shami.“Compelling match to follow from sleepy, ominously mild south east London,” writes James Walsh. “What’s the verdict over there on the attempted rehabilitation of Smith and co? Feels like the soft interviews and cell phone ads have raised more questions than answers, particularly as they have distracted from a really engaging, insomnia-inducing series.”Exactly right. Smith and Bancroft drawing attention back to themselves while the Test team contests a marquee series in the middle of the biggest Test on the Australian calendar - it’s so tin-eared it can barely be believed. 12th over: Australia 43-2 (Khawaja 26, S Marsh 1) When you’re 360 behind on a failing track, do you want your first drop to be skipping down the track to punt sixes in the 12th over? I guess it doesn’t really matter, it’s the cricket version of partying while the asteroid approaches. Khawaja gives Jadeja a ride over long-off. Then a big outside edge to third man. There’s not much calming about this innings, but it’s interesting. I seem to remember Glenn Maxwell taking some tap for batting like this at No3 in the UAE back in 2014...11th over: Australia 34-2 (Khawaja 18, S Marsh 0) Shami on for a bowl, and Khawaja drops a single first ball to give Marsh the strike. There ya go, champ. Marsh tries to resume the pattern of leaving the ball that he’d instituted before Bumrah foxed him in the first innings.10th over: Australia 33-2 (Khawaja 17, S Marsh 0) Shaun Marsh needing a score, as he seemingly always does as he comes to the middle. Beaten by Jadeja immediately.And that’s exactly what he doesn’t do. Goes hard at Jadeja, gets the fast edge, and Agarwal at short leg parries it up, then snaffles the rebound. 9th over: Australia 32-1 (Harris 13, Khawaja 16) Bumrah with a maiden to a watchful Harris, who’s made a few starts in his short career but has to go on.8th over: Australia 32-1 (Harris 13, Khawaja 16) Khawaja pulls out the reverse sweep against Jadeja, who was not just being used to facilitate bowling changes. It worked well for Khawaja in the UAE against Yasir Shah, the Pakistan leg-spinner. He nails it this time and gets four. Australia 367 behind, this is easy right?7th over: Australia 28-1 (Harris 13, Khawaja 12) Was that Jadeja over just so Bumrah could change ends? He does, and overpitches, and Harris drives four. But Harris closes the over giving a worried look at the pitch after another low ball creeps through. Surely any batsman is going to get bowled or lbw eventually if facing enough straight ones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56d7193a18db99267e3608aba479540aa90d0ddc/0_147_3235_1942/master/3235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0788d8210a615221c0b80b216b3a66e5","title":"dirty dancing the messiest stage shows in pictures","story":"As Olivier de Sagazan uses clay to turn himself into a human sculpture at London’s mime festival, we look at the dancers who have performed on stages filled with soil, flowers, dust and water"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea9a8df0b8beab39207ee953c878a01fedc9f89/338_246_3208_1926/master/3208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd28e8ff7ea794aacc482f0071c567f","title":"folding screens 5g smartphones 2019","story":"After the notch, phone makers are turning to hole-punch selfie cams and bigger screens From the launch of 5G to phones with large folding screens, more cameras and fingerprint scanners under the screens, 2019 looks set to transform the smartphone in more ways than one.2018 produced phones with notches hiding selfie cameras and sensors in the top of the screen. While not quite the innovation most were likely seeking, notches allowed manufacturers to remove everything from the front that wasn’t screen.Now that the smartphone is essentially all screen on the front and a slab of glass on the back, what’s next for phone innovation?Notches are an ugly necessity at the moment – everyone but Apple agrees – as the camera has to go somewhere. But they don’t have to be large intrusive bars.2019 will see new hole-punch screens, which literally have small holes in the display through which the selfie camera pokes. Huawei has already announced two phones with a diminutive hole in the display, as has Samsung with its Galaxy A8s.With more devices expected to follow, it appears 2019 will be the year of the punch-hole display.What was long seen as the holy grail of biometric systems, the fingerprint scanner embedded into the screen finally became a reality in the mass market at the end of 2018 with the OnePlus 6T and Huawei Mate 20 Pro.Strictly speaking, the scanners are under the display, reading the ridges on your thumb or finger through the pixels of your screen. The current generation optical sensors are to be joined by improved ultrasonic sensors next year in a variety of phones.When all you have is a screen on the front and camera on the back, there’s not much to differentiate one model from the next in terms of design.“The rectangular touchscreen has become the dominant design for smartphones and there is little sign of that changing anytime soon,” says Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight.If you were hoping for a radical new design in 2019, you might be out of luck.Having killed off the compact camera, smartphones are coming for the big, expensive digital SLRs and their ilk.“Cameras are a major battleground when it comes to competitive differentiation,” says Wood.Expect to see even greater use of computational photography, where multiple images from single or multiple cameras are combined to create a photo with algorithms, improving your candid snaps, particularly in low light.5G will finally launch in 2019 with faster data and ever more expensive phones. But it won’t just be 5G phones pushing up the price. The cost of phones in the top-end market dominated by Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S series is expected to continue to rise.“Don’t be surprised to see the £2,000 phone in 2019 – the advent of 5G, premium materials, perhaps foldable devices and more will see the emergence of a new ultra-premium segment,” says Wood. “Apple has let the way on smartphone inflation and we expect manufacturers to keep pushing the boundaries – particularly as people hold on to their phones for longer.”If you can’t stomach paying £1,000 for a phone, there is hope. With a new super-premium category, the market for slightly more competitive devices that offer top-performance is likely to expand.OnePlus has proved the niche exists with top-end phones costing under £500 in UK. Now it has been joined by Chinese rival Xiaomi and it aggressively priced top end phones, alongside the increasing sales of Honor, Huawei’s cheaper sub-brand.Giant leaps in performance and capability are long gone, chilling the desire to upgrade and leading to an ever increasing segment of the population holding onto their phones for longer.Like the chicken and the egg, it’s likely the more expensive a phone is the longer someone might hold onto it, which may in turn force prices up as manufacturers struggle to maintain profits. At least those without a cut of services such as Google Pay or the Apple App Store.Like something out of science fiction, folding phones will become a reality next year, with one already unveiled and Samsung’s effort due to be launched at some point in 2019.Whether or not the reality lives up to the fantasy, folding phones are likely to remain niche for years.“Although a magnet for gadget lovers, the folding phone’s inevitable high cost and its trade-offs in usability will result in limited shipments. Problems are likely to include poor readability in sunlight, a bulky design to protect the screen’s fold and the need for an external screen,” says Wood in his predictions for CCS Insight.Still, if you really must have the most bleeding-edge device, it looks like you will be able to buy one in some form as the never-ending quest for larger and larger displays continues.

The TV landscape is already so absurdly cluttered that people rarely watch the same shows as each other any more. But now there’s an interactive Black Mirror, Bandersnatch, that unfolds according to the viewer’s wishes. You know what this means? It means that we aren’t even watching the same episode as each other, even when we’re literally watching the same episode as each other. Thanks a lot.Interactive narratives aren’t exactly new. John Hurt made an interactive erotic thriller called Tender Loving Care almost 20 years ago, and more recently Netflix experimented with an interactive Puss In Boots episode, but there’s something fitting about Black Mirror being the show that shoves the form into the mainstream.Because nobody can quite agree on Black Mirror, can they? Where some see bleak social commentary, others just see nastiness for the sake of it. And since the anthology format allows for a range of tones, everyone gets to have their favourite episode style you might enjoy a warm-hearted San Junipero affair or, if you’re an insane psychopath, you might prefer something like Crocodile.But Bandersnatch has the potential to solve everything. By operating around a branching narrative, allowing viewers to choose the direction of the story at intermittent waypoints, you can theoretically create your ideal Black Mirror. Choose the most disastrous option at every turn and you’ll theoretically end up with the grimmest, most nihilistic Black Mirror ever but let a little sunshine in now and again and you might miraculously end up with something that doesn’t make you want to drown yourself in a bath.Fortunately, it works. Bandersnatch is a masterpiece of sophistication. From a user viewpoint, it is seamless. When options present themselves (you chose with a click of your mouse), there’s no lag or buffering to endure. If you don’t make a choice, Netflix makes it for you. As such, it is identical to watching a film. As an experience, it’s remarkable.Even more remarkable, though, is the ambition of storytelling on display. Very loosely based on a real-life unreleased game also called Bandersnatch (completists might like to watch the BBC documentary about that game’s failure), it’s essentially the story of one man’s slow unravelling. In the Black Mirror universe, Bandersnatch is the name of a Choose Your Own Adventure book so complex that it drove its author to murder. When a 21-year-old named Stefan chooses to adapt the book into a video game, he also loses his grasp of reality.But the genius of Bandersnatch is that it’s ultimately a critique of interactivity. During the film, Stefan doesn’t just start to question his free will when he feels that someone else (you) is making his decisions for him, but he ultimately rubs up against the constraints of the binary choices that he’s presented with. In the space of 90 minutes, Brooker has popularised a new form of storytelling, then identified its tropes and dismantled them one by one. In this regard, Bandersnatch is legitimately breathtaking.It’s also incredibly funny at times. Without spoiling too much, at one point you’ll be given the choice to click on a very familiar logo, which sends the whole film down a wormhole of genuine, incredible, self-referential battiness. The moment is a cul-de-sac, so it has no real bearing on the end of the story, but after several years of wallowing in increasingly dour parables, it’s refreshing to see Brooker indulge in his sillier side.There are apparently five endings to Bandersnatch, to which I think I’ve seen three or four. One ending is bleak. One is hilarious. One is abrupt and creepy. You can speed through the episode in less than 40 minutes, or splash around and take closer to two hours. By the time I’d finished exploring I was left with a profound feeling of satisfaction, as if Black Mirror had prodded me towards the ending it felt was best. Which makes sense because, after all, free will is an illusion.So that’s what happens in Bandersnatch. Or at least that’s what happens in the version of Bandersnatch that I experienced. Yours might be completely different. Which makes this whole review redundant, really. Charlie Brooker has ruined television criticism, too.• Bandersnatch is available on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7df5a4560ffba78ef4da159032c284d61d71913/0_170_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79c27ee3c8dab7c01f13882351694f82","title":"new york sky bright blue lights explosion astoria power plant queens","story":"Police investigating transformer explosion at Con Edison plant in the Astoria neighbourhoodA huge explosion at a New York power plant has turned the sky above parts of the city a bright blue-green.Many Manhattanites were stunned when the sky over parts of Queens started to glow a bright neon blue shortly after 9pm on Thursday night.Scores posted footage of the glowing skyline to social media, saying the sky was “bright as day”. Footage of the scene showed the sky flickering a bright blue-green for several minutes.The strange sight was caused by an explosion at the Con Edison power plant in Queens, with the New York Police Department officially confirming on Twitter that the cause of the remarkable sight was the explosion and there was “no evidence of extraterrestrial activity”.“There was a brief electrical fire at our substation in Astoria which involved some electrical transformers and caused a transmission dip in the area. We’re currently investigating the cause of the incident,” Con Edison tweeted.Police advised people to avoid the area and later confirmed no one had been injured as a result of the incident.The New York fire department confirmed they had received multiple reports of explosions in the Long Island City and Astoria area, to which they had responded. At 10:15pm they reported the incident was under control and there were no reported injuries and no fire.Residents left their homes as the black sky turned neon blue, with several telling the  they thought they were witnessing an alien invasion.Lucas Espinoza, a Queens resident, said: “I was eating dinner in my living room and out of nowhere the lights and TV started flickering and then the whole sky – which was pitch black a moment earlier – lit up with a pulsating greenish blue light. I ran up to my rooftop and grabbed the video while it lasted for a few minutes.”George Delis, who lives down the road from the plant, told the : “A little while ago, the TV went out and I see this massive bright light. It was so bright I thought it was a UFO. I was so excited I grabbed my phone and saw right down the block at Con Edison, a transformer was on fire. It was so bright, much brighter than the sun ... I’ve been living here for 37 years and I’ve never seen this happen before.”The incident cause several streets to lose power and also caused a blackout at LaGuardia Airport.The mayor of New York Bill de Blasio confirmed the extraordinary light was “caused by electrical surge at substation”, but said there were no current fire and no injuries. He said the MTA had power, but there were delays on the 7 train and that power was “coming back on” at LaGuardia, but travellers should expect delays.The airport urged people to check their flight status with their carrier, saying “Many flights are departing, some are not”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39467996f89584f62a4152844a274166eb70bd94/0_220_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccb5c01133a577c4c54eb82a25b6c950","title":"british army officer sets record for antarctic expedition miles","story":"Captain Lou Rudd becomes just the second person to trek unaided across continent A British army officer has set the record for the most expedition miles covered in Antarctica, after becoming just the second person in history to trek unaided across the frozen continent.The 925-mile mission, along with his previous expeditions to the continent, means that Capt Lou Rudd, 49, surpassed a total of 3,000 miles of human-powered travel in Antarctica.The father of three from Hereford finished the gruelling endurance race in 56 days on Friday, two days after the US explorer Colin O’Brady became the first person in history to cross the continent unaided.Rudd, a motor transport officer based at the Infantry Battle School in Brecon, Wales, said he was delighted to have finished the expedition, which he undertook in memory of close friend and explorer Henry Worsley, who died from exhaustion just 30 miles short of completing the record solo crossing in 2016.He said: “My number one priority and objective was to come out here and ski solo, unsupported and unassisted right across the continent and I’ve done that. That was always the primary objective.“I want to say a huge congratulations to Colin – what an achievement. To be honest it’s a minor miracle that both of us have completed a journey that’s been attempted before, but nobody’s ever managed it and then, lo and behold, in one season two of us attempting it. The fact that both of us have finished is absolutely fantastic.”Rudd hauled a 140kg sled through 60mph gales, temperatures below minus 30 degrees celsius and over sastrugi – wave-like ridges created by wind – surviving off a grazing bag of chocolate, nuts, cheese and salami.“What matters most to me is that I’ve completed my expedition – and honoured Henry’s memory by carrying his family crest across Antarctica. I know he would have appreciated that. That’s what is really important to me.“And we’ve both done it really fast. Incredibly fast. I’ve finished it within a couple of days of a professional athlete, and I’m delighted with that.”The army officer documented his Spirit of Endurance expedition in blog posts since he began on 3 November, which saw him describing his coping methods during the brutal journey such as a Winston Churchill audiobook and a 1980s music playlist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1779470ac020a5def763c86f7c3363d76b6f1568/97_172_901_540/master/901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a36d92a6393d829945c856c43c0621","title":"how monkey christ brought new life to a quiet spanish town","story":"Cecilia Giménez is proud of her amateur restoration, which has bolstered tourism to Borja and helped fund a care homeTangible and competitively priced proof of one of the Lord’s more mysterious recent manoeuvres can be found in a church nestled in the foothills of the Sierra de Moncayo in north-eastern Spain.A familiar face, now known to the world as Monkey Christ, greets visitors to the Santuario de Misericordia, its blurred and startled features staring down from bottles, thimbles, bookmarks, teddy bears, pens, mugs, T-shirts, mousepads, badges, fridge magnets and keyrings.For centuries, the nearby town of Borja was best known for its wines and splendid 16th-century town hall. All that changed six years ago when a simple act of devotion was transmogrified into an object of ridicule, a meme and, eventually, a tourist attraction.In the summer of 2012, a devout parishioner, Cecilia Giménez, noticed that an already flaking and faded painting on the church’s wall was under threat from a leak.Giménez, then 81, decided that if she did not act, the face of Christ that the artist Elías García Martínez had painted almost a century earlier would disappear for ever.Pained at the idea of its loss – and keen to conserve the interior of the church in which she had been married – Giménez began work, applying thick blocks of colour on which she planned to retrace the ine countenance.Had she been able to finish the job, things might have turned out differently. But Giménez had to leave town on a trip and her incomplete efforts soon came to the attention of the local historical association, which indignantly posted before-and-after pictures of the painting.From there, the story and images went viral.Before long, García Martínez’s work had ceased to be known as Ecce Homo and, as Monkey Christ or Potato Jesus, has become an irresistible visual shorthand for anything tending towards the disastrous.The townsfolk were up in arms, the media descended and Giménez lost 17kg through stress, worry and the thought that she had made a laughing stock out of Christ’s suffering face.Then two things happened: the anger in Borja subsided when people found out who had undertaken the restoration. And the tourists began arriving.“As soon as people knew that it was Cecilia who had done it, everything changed,” says the mayor, Eduardo Arilla. “And this has become a social phenomenon and a pop art icon.”Between August and December 2012, 45,824 people visited the sanctuary. The numbers may have dropped off since then, but Borja still receives 16,000 visitors a year – more than four times the number who came before Giménez picked up her brushes.Not only has the picture’s fame provided jobs for the sanctuary-museum’s two caretakers, it also helps fund places at Borja’s care home for the elderly, a haven for those who would not otherwise be able to afford to live there.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theArilla is careful not to condone the actions that put Borja on the map – and to point out that there is more to the town than just the Ecce Homo – but he welcomes the interest, the tourists and their euros.“It was a media phenomenon, but it’s also been a social phenomenon when it comes to helping people,” he says. “If it hadn’t happened, maybe Borja would have become famous for something else, like its wine. But we wouldn’t be as well known as we are now.”The media phenomenon has not been limited to Borja. In June this year, the overenthusiastic restoration of a 500-year-old statue of St George in a church in Estella, Navarre, elicited comparisons with Tintin, while the treatment meted out to a group of 15th-century wooden statues in Asturias left a professional restorer torn between tears and laughter.Estella’s mayor, Koldo Leoz, says the town has seen an increase in visitor numbers but adds that it predates the St George incident and is down to a concerted effort to restore the old Jewish quarter and attract pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago.Estella, he says, has no plans to capitalise on the botched restoration. “We don’t want to attract visitors because of the poor treatment of our heritage,” he says. “We haven’t publicised it and nor will we.”Ana Galán Pérez, the chair of Spain’s Professional Association of Restorers and Conservators (Acre), argues that such cases show that the country needs to do more to protect the myriad and often forgotten treasures of its past.“We seem to be rather indifferent when it comes to the heritage around us,” she says.“There’s still a long way to go and that’s why we need to educate society and public bodies so that they understand that every time someone without the right qualifications tries to restore a work, they run the risk of damaging or even destroying it.”Galán and others also dispute the notion that Spain is more prone to dodgy conservation than other countries.“When we talk to our colleagues from other European countries, they tell us that these things are happening but that they’re not picked up by the press.”Román Fernández-Baca Casares, director-general of fine arts at Spain’s culture ministry, describes the unfortunate restorations as “isolated cases” and says that almost all the country’s regional governments adhere to strict conservation rules.Giménez has come to terms with both her actions and the fame they have brought her and her town.As the mother of two disabled children, she is used to looking past the surface. When she looks at the Ecce Homo today, she sees “a handsome face a face that I love”.She also insists that she would do the same thing again. “It was done with good intentions and despite what happened, it’s been a good thing for Borja,” she says. “People from all over the world are visiting the sanctuary now. That’s the best medicine. I used to cry a lot over all this but I don’t cry any more because I can see how much I’m loved.”But Giménez is aware that things could have ended less happily.What advice does she have for other amateur restorers? “Don’t do it. It turned out well in the end here, but it doesn’t always end well in Spain - and you’ll find yourself in the papers.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Traffic snarls and grinds on rutted streets. Heavy rain threatens. And Felix Wazekwa’s band load their bus with musical instruments in the suburb of Limete before heading to a tough neighbourhood far across the city. A local candidate in the elections rescheduled for Sunday has hired them to play at a rally.“If you can get people to dance then you can get a message across very easily. The politicians have a message, and I am the very good at getting people to dance. So they come to me,” said Wazekwa, who is one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s biggest stars.The imminent election is two years late and has been forced on President Joseph Kabila, in power since 2001, by popular and international pressure. The stakes are high. The victor will command the DRC’s security establishment – and the lion’s shares of the revenues generated by the country’s vast mineral resources. The losers are likely to face years of repression.In the DRC, music and politics are inseparable. To gain an advantage, many politicians turn to the country’s singers and band leaders, hiring them for rallies, commissioning special compositions, or simply paying for a mention during a song.“During the campaign I sing what I’m told to sing … I’m not here to judge,” said Wazekwa, who recorded a recent single praising the government’s presidential candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, based on a text prepared by aides.With no revenue from royalties, systematic pirating, limited infrastructure and few public performances, many Congolese musicians have always relied on wealthy patrons.“The artists need money and politicians, especially those who have been in power for some time, want to burnish their image. This is a cheap way of getting publicity. You pay to be mentioned in one song, and it gets replayed many, many times,” said Israel Mutala, a Kinshasa-based analyst and columnist.The DRC is a creative powerhouse despite its deep poverty and endemic instability – and its eventful political history has one of Africa’s richest soundtracks.In 1960, the song Independence Cha Cha, celebrating the end of Belgian colonial rule, was a continent-wide hit. During his disastrous three-decade rule, President Mobutu Sese Seko commissioned “praise songs” from top artists.In recent years, a more contemporary and gritty style has emerged to challenge the famous “Rumba Lingala”, the DRC’s 70-year-old, Cuban-influenced, popular musical tradition.Not all see the tight ties between creative artists and politicians as healthy.“If there’s a relationship between music and politics, then it’s a very perverted one … When there are so many dead, raped, sick, miserable in this country then we musicians have a responsibility too … These are our fans, our brothers and sisters,” said Alex Dende Esakanu, AKA Lexxus Legal, one of the DRC’s most popular rappers.“Of course musicians have the right to take the politicians’ money, but I say it’s immoral.”Esakanu, 39, is now an opposition candidate and spokesman for the campaign of Martin Fayulu, a former businessman who was a marginal figure before the campaign but has been attracting large crowds.“The authorities are doing everything than can to block us. If the elections are fair, we have every chance of winning,” said Eskanu, speaking to the  at his home in a poor neighbourhood of central Kinshasa which, like most of the city, suffers from a chronic lack of electricity and drinking water.The DRC is in better shape than after the terrible civil war which ended in 2002, but 14 million of its 76 million inhabitants need emergency aid. In the east, dozens of militia battle for resources and at least 300 people have died in an outbreak of Ebola. The country is the size of western Europe but has no real road or rail network. Prices for basic necessities are soaring.“People have a very deep, strong desire to express themselves at the polls. They think that by voting they will have a better life. There is deep disillusion with the government and they want to punish those who have been in power,” said Mutala.Many blame Kabila, who took power at 29 after his father, Laurent, was assassinated in 2001, for the problems. But Kabila’s reluctant decision to step down, two years after his second electoral mandate expired, has defused some tension.Most observers believe Shadary will win, and many fear fraud to make sure the government’s choice is the victor. People have been shot at by police during rallies and protests.On Wednesday , the electoral commission announced it was cancelling voting in the cities of Beni and Butembo and their surrounding areas because of Ebola and militia violence. The areas are opposition stronghold, and local politicians denounced the move as an effort to swing the vote in Shadary’s favour.The two biggest opposition political figures have been barred from the contest on legal grounds so votes against the government will be split between Fayulu and Félix Tshisekedi, the only other candidate.“They’ve been very tactical, very clever. They’ve got the opposition exactly where they want them,” one diplomat in Kinshasa said of the government.Kabila told reporters this month he would not leave politics and planned to stand for election in 2023.Wazekwa defended his work for Shadary, who is under EU sanctions for his role in a crackdown on pro-democracy protestors last year.Other musicians pointed out that refusing a request from the government brings significant risks: tax investigations, cancelled licenses to perform and worse. A rapper who criticised the “vultures in velvet” in power was abducted by unknown men in the eastern city of Bukavu this month.Melo Costa Yekima, one of the leading figures in a new wave of younger musicians mixing dance with rap, said he had refused demands to record from both government and opposition.“You can’t separate music from politics ... I just try to ring an alarm bell and tell things as they are in our society,” said Yekima. “The elections are a good thing but I don’t think they will bring the changes that people want. But I am optimistic. I believe that things will sort themselves out here one day and Congo is going to be beautiful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ec3ff3bc0047ba2ca036a339b521b8466011f3/0_71_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ab7043aa0385c70f046a921a07b72a6","title":"syrian kurdish militia manbij turkey","story":"Kurdish appeal for help follows Trump’s surprise decision to pull US military out of SyriaSyria’s military has arrived at the frontline of the flashpoint town of Manbij, after Kurdish fighters appealed to Damascus for help against the threat of attack by Turkey in the face of the withdrawal of US troops from the area.It was not immediately clear whether US personnel, who are based in the town and have been patrolling Manbij and the tense frontline between it and adjacent towns where Turkey-backed fighters are based, were still present. The US-led coalition against Isis did not respond to a request for comment.“We invite the Syrian government forces … to assert control over the areas our forces have withdrawn from, in particularly Manbij, and to protect these areas against a Turkish invasion,” a statement from the People’s Protection Units (YPG) said.The Syrian army had already mobilised before the public Kurdish invitation. It said on Friday morning that units had entered the town on the western bank of the Euphrates.A monitor and several local sources said Syrian troops had only massed on the edges of the town rather than the city centre, and that the Syrian flag had been raised above official buildings for the first time in years.Syrian rebel groups backed by Turkey said in response that they had also begun moving towards Manbij in full readiness for a military operation.The conflicting reports from Manbij are a harbinger of the chaos that is likely to ensue at the end of the 60-100 day timetable for the withdrawal of US troops, with the remaining fighting forces in Syria scrambling to replace them.The plea for help from the Kurds, six years after they broke from Damascus, comes after Donald Trump’s surprise decision earlier this month to withdraw the 2,000 US troops stationed in Kurdish-held Syria, known locally as Rojava. The troops had been acting as a buffer between Turkey and Syria’s Kurds.Kurdish forces have been the US’s most important ground partner in the fight against Isis, but Ankara views them as a terrorist threat and extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within its own borders.Trump’s decision, made after a phone call with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, shocked many in Rojava, who said it left them caught between the claws of the Turkish leader and Assad.The Syrian army said in a statement it would guarantee “full security for all Syrian citizens and others present in the area”.Russia, the main ally of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, said the development was a positive step which could stabilise the situation in north-east Syria. Turkish officials are due to arrive in Moscow on Saturday for talks over Syria’s future after the US withdrawal. As Russia controls much of Syria’s airspace, Erdoğan is likely to need cooperation from Moscow for any aerial bombardment of the YPG.The YPG seized Manbij from Isis in 2016, and the town on Syria’s northern border has since become the frontline between the Kurds and Turkey in Syria’s complex civil war.The US agreed to facilitate the removal of YPG fighters from the town as part of efforts to appease Turkey, its Nato ally, earlier this year, but perceived stalling on the matter infuriated Erdoğan. He has said repeatedly in recent months that his forces would deal with threats to Turkey’s safety themselves.The YPG says its fighters recently withdrew from Manbij to fight the remnants of Isis in the east of the country. The allied Manbij Military Council nominally remains in charge of the area.Speaking after Friday prayers in Istanbul, Erdoğan said that facts on the ground remained uncertain and dismissed the Syrian army’s entry into Manbij as a “psychological move”.Ankara has insisted it has the capability to take over the battle against the last few thousand battle-hardened Isis troops and has Trump’s to do so – although the withdrawal decision prompted the resignations of his defence secretary Jim Mattis and envoy to the coalition against Isis, Brett McGurk.The UK’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, criticised the decision on Friday, saying that the US president “makes a speciality of talking in very black and white terms about what’s happening in the world”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3742507.1545947137!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mass extinction of species is happening in ireland ngo says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA number of species are ‘critically endangered’ and face a real risk of disappearing entirely without urgent action, including the curlew. Photograph: Mark L Stanley via Getty ImagesMass extinction of species is happening on Ireland’s doorstep. “It is not something which is happening somewhere else,” according to the Irish Wildlife Trust. A third of all species groups examined in Ireland, including plants, birds, butterflies, freshwater fish, dragonflies and sharks are either threatened with extinction or “near threatened”, it said.Although the climate crisis and its causes were relatively well known, the related “extinction crisis” was receiving less attention, the trust stated in a submission to the Government’s Climate Action Committee. In addition to global warming, loss of species is being driven by habitat loss, pollution and unsustainable use of resources, it warned.“Ninety per cent of our highest-value habitats protected under the EU’s Habitats Directive are in ‘poor’ or ‘inadequate’ status,” it said.Only 0.6 per cent of once-unique raised bog habitats in the midlands remain intact. In addition, Ireland has the second-lowest forest cover in Europe only about 1 per cent of our land area consists of native woodland.Chronic overfishing “has decimated the populations of once-abundant fish species such as cod, whiting, sole and herring”, and a third of native bee species face extinction, it said.Some 50 per cent of Irish rivers and lakes “are polluted, while obstructions such as dams contribute to once common species like Atlantic salmon appearing on the endangered species list.A number of species are “critically endangered”, and face a real risk of disappearing entirely without urgent action, including the curlew, the angel shark, the freshwater pearl mussel and the European eel. “Restoring nature is likely to be the easiest, cheapest and most effective form of climate action available,” the trust said.It called for an independent nature conservation agency to implement existing conservation commitments and underlined the need to “re-wet and re-wild” midlands bogs. Coillte, it said, must manage existing conifer plantations but restore them to native woodlands.The revised Common Agricultural Policy should adequately reward farmers for farming in a nature-friendly way so that Irish agriculture can be “carbon negative”, it added. “Weakened ecosystems cope poorly with climate change – as was experienced through 2018 as farming communities struggled with weather extremes,” it said. “Small-scale coastal fishing communities have all but disappeared. Conversely, restoring natural systems brings great opportunity in bringing benefits back to local people and resilience to those who depend upon them.”The trust hoped the Climate Action Committee could see the opportunity that restoring nature would provide in determining on how best Ireland should respond to climate change. “We firmly believe that this is a decisive moment in our relationship with the natural world and that we are likely to be the last generation to have the power to take meaningful measures to save life on Earth. This can be done to the great benefit of Irish communities,” Irish Wildlife Trust campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty stated in the submission.

Photograph: Getty ImagesIreland’s research centre for medical devices is to consider developing a national animal testing lab, to trial medical implants on large animals.Cúram, which is funded by Science Foundation Ireland, partners with several other Irish universities and focuses on developing medical implants.The HSE recently advertised a public tender on behalf of Cúram for a consultant to draw up a white paper for a national animal testing facility.Tender documents state the “rationale” for the national testing lab was to deal with a growing pipeline of new devices from industry groups and academic researchers.“There is an increase in the requirement for large animal medical device trials in order to bridge translation to human trials,” the tender states. “If Ireland had such a facility, it will enable faster translation of implant prototypes as potential human therapies.”The document outlines that there was a “general view” from multinational medical device producers in Ireland that a centralised testing facility for large animals would be beneficial for research and development.The University College Dublin veterinary hospital had the potential to play a “central role” in the venture, the tender document said. Currently the hospital treats close to 6,000 animals a year.University College Cork also had “limited facilities” for animal cardiovascular research, but the option of locating a potential lab there would be “cost prohibitive”, the tender specifications said.The consultant would be required to complete a feasibility report on a national testing lab by March, and provide a white paper on how the facility would operate by June.In recent years animal rights groups have criticised Irish universities for using animals in medical tests. Trinity College Dublin bought nearly 110,000 live animals between 2012 and 2016, for use in biomedical research.Previously the Irish Anti-Vivisection Society, who campaigns against animal testing, has called for stricter regulation around the area from Government.Medical devices make up almost 10 per cent of all Irish exports and Ireland comes second only after Germany as the largest European exporter of medical devices. Common medical implants developed in Ireland include hip replacements, stents, and pacemakers. About 38,000 people work in the industry, in both indigenous and multinational businesses."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Former taoiseach sought red carpet for Abbeville lawn from Aer

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe The offer of a free repeat smear test for women concerned following the CervicalCheck controversy will come to and end next week as the HSE continues to struggle with a backlog of tests.The HSE has told The  that, as of December 9th, there were 86,803 smear test samples still in progress, and not yet reported, compared with approximately 23,000 smear test samples which would normally be in progress at any one time.Last April, all women of screening age were offered a free repeat screening test with GPs registered with CervicalCheck as the Government attempted to maintain confidence in the service.The Government was forced to apologise in October after it emerged that there was a backlog of more than 60,000 women who were waiting on the results of their test.A spokesman for the HSE said that between May and October this year, and when compared to the same period in the previous year, “CervicalCheck recorded an increase of over 70,000 smear tests being carried out in what is a skilled, labour-intensive test”.“This has been caused by three main factors: women availing of out-of-cycle, or repeat, smear tests a return by many women to the programme who had previously not engaged and women attending their routine smear test when invited. This upsurge in activity has led to a backlog in the laboratories that carry out the analysis of each smear sample slide,” the spokesman said.Furthermore, it is still taking more than 20 weeks in some cases to process the tests and return the results.“The HSE regrets that due to the increased demand in cervical screening from repeat as well as routine tests, we are experiencing significant delays in the reporting of results. Results are currently being reported in approximately 20 weeks of the test being taken. In some cases it is taking 20-plus weeks.“We apologise to patients affected and are doing everything possible to improve this situation. We are also keeping women informed of the latest waiting times for results by publishing and updating the details on our website.”The HSE said that laboratories have agreed to undertake additional recruitment, and are using overtime and managing annual leave in an effort to address the backlog.Smear test samples must also be sent to the laboratory and made into slides within six weeks of the smear test date. After this point, the sample expires and cannot be tested.A spokesman said that from April to October 2018 the rate of expired samples and vials was 0.29 per cent. This represents 503 out of a total of 171,814 samples taken. “This compares with a rate of 0.25 per cent for the same period in 2017,” he said.“Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues. In such cases, a woman and her GP are advised of the need for a repeat test at least three months after their previous test by letter from CervicalCheck.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3735778.1545149217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"haughey insisted mitterrand stop off at his home for champagne","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Charles Haughey welcoming French president Francois Mitterrand at Dublin Airport in February 1988.Charles Haughey demanded a personal visit by François Mitterrand to his north Dublin mansion be included in the itinerary only three days before the French president arrived in Ireland.Haughey never disguised his enormous admiration for the French socialist politician. Documents show that the then taoiseach pulled out all the stops for the president’s state visit to Ireland in February 1988.He gave the French president the gift of a valuable painting by Louis le Brocquy – a portrait of Samuel Beckett’s head – to mark his visit to Dublin. The president returned later that year to holiday with Haughey on his private island, Inisvickillaun, off the Co Kerry coast.A note written by an official in the taoiseach’s department disclosed Haughey made the proposal that Mitterrand visit Abbeville, his Gandon mansion in Kinsealy, Dublin, on February 22nd, only three days before the arrival.The official notes the proposal was made “when the programme for the visit had been drawn up and agreed by the French side”.Haughey said it could occur while the French politician was returning from a visit to the passage grave at Newgrange to the French embassy in Dublin.When the idea\u0026nbspwas put to the head of French protocol, he replied it would not be possible to confirm the change until Mitterrand arrived in Ireland.A planned visit to Portmarnock Golf Club and beach was dropped to facilitate the proposed Abbeville stop-off, for which two Puma helicopters would be required.The Irish Air Corps said it was “operationally feasible” to land the helicopters on the back lawn of Abbeville. That was confirmed by Ciarán Haughey, a son of the taoiseach, himself a helicopter pilot.An official visited Abbeville on the eve of the proposed visit there, and met Haughey’s wife, Maureen Haughey, to make tentative arrangements.“The Taoiseach indicated he required a red carpet to be in position at the back lawn. One was obtained from Aer Rianta,” noted the official.Haughey ensured the visit was added by mentioning it to the French president as soon as he arrived in Dublin. Mitterrand said he would be “happy to accept the invitation”.The party arrived in two helicopters on Thursday at 5.15pm, almost half an hour late.“That was because programmes over-ran at Newgrange and at Monasterboice. The president did not curtail the time he spent in Abbeville and left at 5.45pm. The proposed walk of the grounds did not take place because the weather had turned very cold.”The taoiseach presented the le Brocquy painting during the visit. Mrs Haughey offered champagne to the guests but no food. No media was present.The official noted that because two helicopters had landed “the group at Abbeville was rather large for the dining room. It would have been more desirable if only one helicopter had been used”.It was noted the ballroom could not be used because wedding presents belonging to Haughey’s daughter, Eimear Mulhearn, were stored there.For the State dinner at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, the music was provided by soprano Bernadette Greevy and by the traditional group De Danann, led by Frankie Gavin. Haughey’s select guest list featured some of his prominent business friends including John Mulhearn, Des Traynor, Larry Goodman, Dermot Desmond, Michael Smurfit, Ben Dunne and property developer John Byrne. Among the other guests were broadcaster Gay Byrne and poet Brendan Keneally.The menu for the State dinner was: Bouchée de fruits de mer Darne de saumon aux asperges and Macedoine de fruits au coulis de framboises. The wine list comprised champagne, Chablis Grand Cru H Loroche 1986, Chateau Kirwan 1982 and\u0026nbspChateau de Tracy 1986.Among the other gifts considered was a Waterford glass oval fruit bowl (£567). No value was given for the Beckett painting – one of a series of portraits le Brocquy did of the playwright which have fetched prices from a few thousand euro to as much as £400,000 (€492,781) at auction.Both leaders held a one-to-one meeting where Haughey tried, without success, to persuade Mitterrand to allow Ryanair fly between both countries.“We are very anxious to develop the European tourist trade with a specialist (tourist) type from France,” said Haughey, adding that this would require the best possible access and air services.At the time there were 200,000 French visitors to Ireland each year but Haughey noted: “Unfortunately the numbers are falling because the air fares are too high.”According to a record of the meeting, Mitterrand replied: “But you have so many writers and so much literature to attract people.”“We can’t compete with the mass tourism of Spain and the sun countries,” said Haughey.Mitter rand said: “But there are so many books. I have come here myself. I have spend peaceful days among the reeds. There are wild geese.”To which Haughey replied: “But the wild geese go to France.”Ryanair had been refused permission to use Beauvais airport because it was not in an IrelandFrance air agreement. Irish authorities were trying to get Ryanair access to Orly airport which was covered. It was clear from the meeting that Mitterrand did not want to engage with Haughey on the issue.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3736933.1545230086!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland leaders no match for dublin thatcher aide said","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative MP Ian Gow, who was killed in an IRA car bomb in 1990. Photograph: PANorthern Ireland was at its “greatest moment of peril” because its political leaders were no match for the Dublin government, a close personal friend of Margaret Thatcher later assassinated by the IRA confided in a diplomat 30 years ago.Documents stamped “confidential” and “seen by Taoiseach”, newly declassified under the 30-year rule, show Conservative MP Ian Gow thought unionism was “weak” while then taoiseach Charlie Haughey’s tactics were to be admired.Gow, himself a strident unionist who the IRA killed with a car bomb because of his closeness to Thatcher and sway over British policy on Ireland, met Richard Ryan of the Irish Embassy in London for lunch in May 1988.The then chairman of the influential Tory backbench committee on Northern Ireland said he was interested in potential movement from unionists amid a political stalemate after the Anglo-Irish Agreement.Haughey’s approach in trying to reach a breakthrough was “quite coherent and understandable” unlike the “weak element” of Jim Molyneaux, the then leader of the dominant Ulster Unionist Party, he said.“Although Molyneaux is a friend of Gow, and Gow of course stands for Molyneaux’s interests, Gow has really lost faith in Molyneaux’s capacity as a leader,” the diplomat reported back to Dublin.Northern Ireland’s foremost unionist leader at the time “does not fully understand what he is at or what he may be getting into” or is not “equipped with enough statesmanship or courage to deliver in exchanges with Dublin”, Gow said.Ryan said that Gow had “moved in a major way” insofar as he used to believe that Haughey could not “easily do business with the British, and could not at all do business with the unionists”.“Gow now acknowledges that he was wrong in this regard,” he wrote.“He said he can not blame the Taoiseach for his tactics – indeed, he had to express admiration for them.“It all adds up, in his view, to the ‘greatest moment of peril for Ulster’ because Dublin has got its act together and Ulster has no leaders of sufficient quality to engage at an equal level of efficiency in debate with Dublin.”During the lunch, Gow asked if the taoiseach “would be prepared to receive him” and two others from Friends of the Union, a one-time Tory grouping committed to the union between Britain and Northern Ireland.“I probed him a little about what he thought could come out of such a meeting,” Ryan reported.“He said they had given the suggestion much thought. They understand that there is a great distance between them and the Taoiseach as to where the long-term solution for Northern Ireland may best lie.“However, they noticed some of his recent statements with great interest.”Gow said he would understand, however, if no meeting was granted on the basis it would hardly “result in profound changes of attitude on either side”.Two years later, Gow died after being blown up by an IRA bomb placed under his car at his home in East Sussex.Shortly afterwards, a visibly shaken Thatcher told reporters at Downing Street that the death of one of her closest friends was an “enormous loss”.Haughey said in a statement that Gow was “a man of honour, of integrity and of deep conviction”.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3743087.1546013576!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tuam excavation government unsure what it is getting into","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe site of a mass grave for children who died in the Tuam mother-and-baby home in Co Galway. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Taoiseach has said the first excavations at the site of the former Tuam mother-and-baby home will begin in the second half of next year and that Government does not know what it is “getting into” yet with the initiative.Leo Varadkar said legislation would have to pass through the Oireachtas before the work began but that the Cabinet had agreed to a “phased approach” to the forensic excavation and recovery of the remains.Following on from the work of Co Galway historian Catherine Corless, who gathered death certificates for 796 infants linked to the home, a Commission of Investigation into mother-and-baby homes found “significant quantities” of human remains in disused septic tanks in Tuam.Mother-and-baby homes were institutions generally run by nuns where women who became pregnant outside marriage gave birth. In the main these babies were adopted, often by Catholic families in the US, in return for a donation.The Bon Secours Sisters, which ran the home in Galway from 1925 to 1961, has offered €2.5 million towards the cost of the excavation. The State faces a bill of up to €12 million.Mr Varadkar said the Government had begun the work of identifying experts while the legislation makes its way through the Oireachtas ahead of any excavations. The initial work at the Tuam site will focus on the remains known to be in the chambers identified by the commission. Remains that are recovered will be analysed and, where possible, identified.“We’ve never really done this before in Ireland, on this scale, so we’ve a lot to set up, and a lot to learn before we do it,” Mr Varadkar told reporters during an end-of-year interview.“We’re not entirely sure what we’re getting into, but as a Government we’re convinced this is the right thing to do, to remove the remains and to give those children a proper, decent burial they didn’t get and if possible to identify some of them if we can, if the technology allows that.”Minister for Children Katherine Zappone wrote to Pope Francis on the issue after his visit to Ireland earlier this year. She explained the history of mother-and-baby homes in Ireland, the high mortality rates in them and the burial of children on the grounds of the former home in Tuam.The Minister sought from the pope that the church “accept its responsibilities and make reparation for its party in a very shameful chapter of Irish history”.In a three-paragraph response on Vatican-headed paper, dated November 13th, the pope said he was praying that “efforts made” by the Government and the Catholic Church in Ireland will help “face responsibly this tragic chapter in Ireland’s history”.He made no reference to a financial contribution to the excavation of unidentified human remains from the site of the former home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3743171.1546019000!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"workers to get single sick cert after benefit scheme overhaul","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAbout 359,000 people are currently in receipt of illness, disability or caring payments. Photograph: ThinkstockA planned overhaul of the €600 million sickness benefit scheme will see workers issued with a single certificate to cover the entire expected period of an illness.And guidelines will be issued to GPs advising them how long a sick cert should last depending on the specific illness.At present, a person claiming illness benefit for longer than a week must provide a new sick cert for each additional week of illness.Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty has said the new system will ensure the correct level of payment is given “for the appropriate period of time”.“Given the nature and volume of illness benefit claims received by my department, I am very much open to improving the claims process in any way which benefits recipients while ensuring the appropriate payment goes to the appropriate person for the appropriate period of time. Ultimately, we should aim to have a system that works efficiently and as simply as possible.”Under the new process, a person will receive a single sick cert for a complete period of an illness based on the expected duration of recovery from the illness.“This process would remove the need for ongoing weekly certification where an illness lasts longer than a week. The period of closed certification would be based on the GP’s assessment of their patient and the department’s closed certification guidelines,” a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Protection said.“The guidelines provide evidence-based, expected durations of recovery for common health conditions and common surgical procedures, categorised according to the international standard ICD10 classification of illnesses.”The department has said the “clinical judgment” of the GP would take precedence.“It is important to state that the department’s guidelines are not prescriptive. There will, undoubtedly, be inidual variations in recovery times, some patients recovering and returning to work earlier than expected, others later. Ultimately, the clinical judgment of the treating GP or specialist will be paramount.“The new certification process should provide patients with a clear expectation of duration of recovery and also be a more efficient process for the GP, the customer and the department.”Up to 55,000 people claim illness benefit at any one time countrywide. The scheme costs the Government €600 million every year and the department receives about 1,000 illness benefit claims each working day.Concerns about the cost of the scheme have been raised as far back as 2012 by the former minister for protection Joan Burton.She said costs relating to illness benefit, disability allowance and invalidity pension were “enormous”.“The number of people claiming these payments and the costs relating to them have soared in recent years,” she said, pointing towards a 44 per cent increase from some 170,000 to some 247,000 between 2001 and 2010.About 359,000 people are currently in receipt of illness, disability or caring payments.Ms Burton said that in previous consultations with employers, an issue which has been raised was the “perception among employers, which I share, that there were serious issues about the way in which some medical practitioners issued sick notes” for the scheme.Workers in the Department of Social Protection itself have taken about 200,000 illness benefit claims every year over the last three years.The top most common medical conditions certified related to musculoskeletal issues, low back pain, stress, anxiety and post-operative conditions.About 60 per cent of claims, 120,000, resulted in a return to work within six weeks with a further 12 per cent, or about 23,000, returned to work within seven to 14 weeks.The average worker at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was out for 13 days due to illness, figures for 2017 show.This compares with an average of under nine days across the public service. The total cost of sick leave across the public service is estimated at €341.5 million for 2017."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3743387.1546028193!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british pm slated for giving knighthood to top brexiteer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHonours were awarded to Labour’s Alan Campbell, leading Brexiteer John Redwood and former Tory minister Gary Streeter.  Campaigners for a second EU referendum have accused Theresa May of weakness after one of Parliament’s most prominent Brexiteers was made a knight in the new year’s honours list.John Redwood was one of the Eurosceptic cabinet ministers branded “bastards” by John Major as he fought to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, and has continued to fly the anti-EU banner in the Commons ever since.He was among three MPs awarded knighthoods, alongside Conservative former minister Gary Streeter and Labour’s deputy chief whip Alan Campbell. With the crunch vote on Theresa May’s EU Withdrawal Agreement due within the next three weeks, Westminster has been buzzing with speculation that honours may be deployed as a means of luring MPs to back the Prime Minister.And a leading supporter of the Best for Britain campaign, Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, said the announcement brought “dishonour” on the honours system.“I cannot see how it is anything but a desperate attempt to blunt criticism of the prime minister’s Brexit deal by dangling a knighthood or two in front of MPs,” said Ms Moran.“All this does is erode trust in politics. Knights of the realm are meant to represent the best of being British, not backstabbing Brexit extremists like John Redwood.“It just shows how weak Theresa May is that she is seen to be rewarding him for his behaviour.”In an apparent attempt to reassure supporters that he will not be swayed by his gong, Mr Redwood published a blog just days ahead of the announcement of his honour outlining “Eight things wrong with the Withdrawal Agreement”.Mr Streeter, who backed Remain in the 2016 referendum, has already made clear that he supports the prime minister’s deal.A banker and academic, Mr Redwood headed the 10 Downing Street policy unit under Margaret Thatcher from 1982-87, where he was a champion of privatisation.He entered parliament as MP for Wokingham in 1987 and rose to cabinet rank in 1993 as Wales secretary, where his most memorable moment came when he attempted to mime the Welsh national anthem despite clearly not knowing the words.His clash with Mr Major over Europe came to a head in 1995 when the then prime minister called on his critics to “put up or shut up” and resigned to permit a leadership contest.Mr Redwood stood against him but received only 89 votes to Mr Major’s 219. After being defeated in a second bid for the leadership in 1997, he returned to the Tory frontbenches from 1997-2005 under William Hague and Michael Howard.An early supporter of an in-out referendum on Europe, Mr Redwood has argued since the 2016 Brexit vote for a clean break from the EU which he said should be “quick and easy”.The 67-year-old investment strategist said he considered his knighthood “a great honour”. Alongside his political work, he is a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford University and has supported the children’s charity, Variety.Mr Streeter (63) entered parliament in 1992 as MP for Plymouth Sutton and has represented a constituency in Devon since 1997.A solicitor by profession, he was a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor’s Department in the final years of the Major administration before serving as Mr Hague’s shadow international development secretary from 1998-2001.A committed Christian, he told PA that he hoped his honour came in part in recognition of his work over the past 10 years as the chairman of the all-party group on Christians in parliament and mentoring new MPs after their arrival at Westminster.Mr Campbell (61) was a history teacher before entering politics and has represented Tynemouth since 1997.He served as a whip in Tony Blair’s government and was a minister in the Home Office for two years under Gordon Brown.He was appointed opposition deputy chief whip by Ed Miliband in 2010 and remains in that position under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. “It is a great honour to receive this award.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireUK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned the EU must provide further assurances over the Irish border backstop if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is to get through UK parliament.Mr Hunt said he believes the backstop is the only “outstanding issue” and can be solved, noting the EU has agreed it is temporary and the UK needs it to define “what temporary is”.He added he is a supporter of Mrs May’s deal “with those qualifications to the backstop” and predicted such assurances would sway MPs as they weigh up the prospect of a “cataclysmic” no-deal Brexit.Mr Hunt also said there is a need to have a “version” of Mrs May’s deal which they can get through parliament.His remarks came as Jeremy Corbyn urged the PM to cut the Christmas recess short and recall parliament so MPs can vote on the Brexit deal.The Labour leader said he wanted to have a vote “as soon as possible”, and accused Theresa May of trying to “run down the clock” and offer MPs a choice between “the devil or the deep blue sea”.MPs are due to return to the Commons on January 7th after a two-week Christmas break, and will begin a new debate on Mrs May’s deal on January 9th — with a vote expected to take place the following week.Mr Hunt, appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: “The EU has agreed that the backstop is temporary and what we need them to do is define what temporary is.“So my view is this is not the time to be talking about what other major changes we might be faced with making because actually we can get this through.“We can get this through, absolutely can.”Mr Hunt reiterated the need for the EU to define the temporary nature of the backstop, adding: “Because if it is temporary then parliament can live with that, but you need to show us.“So I am a supporter of Theresa May’s deal with those qualifications to the backstop and I think MPs, as they reflect on how close we are to an agreement, but also how cataclysmic it would be if we didn’t end up having an agreement we could get through parliament, the best thing is to put our heads down and make sure we have a version of this agreement that we can through parliament.”Asked if he was interested in becoming Conservative Party leader, Mr Hunt replied: “I think we have a very good leader of the Conservative Party, a very good prime minister, frankly, doing probably the most difficult job of any leader in the Western world right now, and what we need to do — as she’s battling for Britain — is get behind her.”Mr Corbyn, in an interview with the Independent, refused to be drawn on whether Labour would seek to extend Article 50 to keep the UK in the EU for longer, and said: “Lots of things are possible, the EU has longform on reopening and extending negotiations, but let’s not jump too many hoops when we haven’t arrived at them.”Mr Corbyn also said it was in Mrs May’s hands whether she should recall parliament a week early, on January 2nd.“I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it,” he told the paper.“But it looks to me the Government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week.“We need to have that vote so a decision of parliament can be made. What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”A Downing Street source labelled Mr Corbyn’s call a “silly demand”, and said: “Following debate in the Commons, in the week commencing January 14th MPs will vote on the Brexit deal.“Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan, and only intends to frustrate Brexit — ultimately betraying the referendum result.”Elsewhere, shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to support if the prime minister’s deal is rejected.The shadow chancellor told the Financial Times such a move would “run the clock down even further towards March 29th”, when Britain is due to leave the EU. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade.The logistics of working in a remote part of Madagascar - where access to the lakes by vehicle is only possible for three months a year - have been an enormous challenge, requiring us to come up with novel approaches.Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival.If we can make this work, it will provide a powerful example not just for of how save the planet\u0027s most threatened species but how communities can manage an ecosystem to benefit people and wildlife, especially in areas of significant poverty.The ducklings inside the converted Scottish fish farm cage where they lived for a weekThe pochard was thought to have become extinct until it was rediscovered by American wildlife experts from The Peregrine Fund in 2006.Three years later teams from the UK organisations went over to Madagascar and helped rear some of the birds in captivity using a box and a Tupperware container as a ‘lake’. However, those birds that were hatched without siblings were given a rolled up sock to keep them company and serve as a “best friend”.Madagascar pochards spend almost all their time on water and, importantly, feed underwater.Members of the WWT conservation team releasing the Madagascar pochard ducklings at Lake Sofia, MadagascarFor this reason, a plan was conceived to convert Scottish salmon-farming cages into the world\u0027s first floating aviaries.After successful trials in 2017, the aviaries were shipped from the UK to Madagascar and assembled on Lake Sofia this summer.Then those ducklings which hatched in October were transported 124 miles to the lake along a dirt road to be reared in land-based aviaries.In December, just before the ducks were able to fly, they were moved into the floating aviaries.Madagascar pochard ducklings at the floating aviaries at Lake Sofia, Madagascar, which serve as a temporary aquatic home for the world\u0026#39s rarest duckOther floating equipment - feeding stations and loafing rafts, designed to promote breeding - have also been specially designed and installed on the lake to give the birds the best possible chance of survival.With much of the wetlands across northern Madagascar severely degraded due to human encroachment, conservationists have also been working to improve the condition of Lake Sofia.The floating aviaries visible on Lake SofiaDr Glyn Young, head of birds at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, said: The idea that we could be releasing pochards into the wild only 12 years after rediscovery pays remarkable testament to the dreams and hard work of many people from Madagascar, Jersey and the UK, who have worked tirelessly to see this remarkable bird get a chance of survival in a changing world.The state of the wetlands in Madagascar is so poor they would probably not survive if they left the lake. Consequently, the pioneering approach  of using the cages helped ensure they settled on the lake and did not stray to less habitable environments.Pochard eggs being cultivated in captivityThe Madagascar pochard is a species endemic to the African island. While it was once common, widespread deforestation and water pollution caused by the arrival of humans on the island led to the decline in the species and the belief it had been entirely wiped out.

That\u0027s something that hit a high spot that will last forever, so I\u0027m very grateful to all the other Pythons and I am very proud of Python,” he said.His co-star John Cleese previously claimed he turned down a CBE in the 1990s, as well as a peerage in the House of Lords because it “involved being in England in the winter”.Other stars on this year’s list include the model Twiggy, who joked that it has been purgatory keeping the news of her damehood a secret.Born Lesley Hornby, the 65-year-old has been awarded the title for her services to fashion, the arts and charity.She said: It\u0027s wonderful, but it makes me giggle.When we wake up every morning we turn to each other, my husband (Leigh Lawson) and I, and we just giggle. So it\u0027s a very nice, warm feeling, and obviously I am very honoured.”Brought up in Neasden, north-west London, her career began when she was spotted at the age of 16.Dubbed The Face of \u002766, she became arguably the world\u0027s first supermodel during a four year career.My only sadness with this is my mum and dad aren\u0027t here to know, she said.1966, A portrait of model Twiggy sitting on a studio floor wearing a pink fashionable dress and large silver bauble earringsEngland footballer Harry Kane, who won the World Cup’s Golden Boot with six goals in the summer, revealed he learned of his MBE only minutes before a match kicked off on December 5.We got a letter to the house, Kate opened the letter...it was before the Southampton game.Normally we\u0027d talk a little but she would never call me just before the match. I had a missed call and she texted me \u0027could you answer?\u0027.I thought something was wrong! But Kate was excited and told me that we\u0027d had a letter from the Queen saying we\u0027d get an MBE.I\u0027m proud for her as well and the whole family. It\u0027s not just for me. We\u0027re part of a journey together.Gareth Southgate, the England manager, joins Kane on the list as he is made an OBE for services to football.Perhaps the most controversial name from the world of entertainment to appear on the list is the BBC presenter Chris Packham. The naturalist, 57, has long infuriated countryside groups with his outspoken opposition to hunting, badger culling and field sports.Last night he suggested his CBE was a reward from the animals that have been saved from suffering due to his conservation work.Maybe the silent have spoken, maybe a terrified fox, a wounded harrier or a trapped badger whispered and this is their thanks,” he said.Other television stars on the list include the Downton Abbey actor Jim Carter, who said he was delighted at being able to share news of his OBE with his 99-year-old mother, Molly Carter.The actor, who plays butler Charles Carson in the period drama, has been given the award for his services to drama.Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason is awarded a CBE for services to music after featuring on every album produced by the progressive rock group since he co-founded the band in 1965.Christopher Nolan, one of the highest grossing directors of all-time, is made a CBE after being recognised for services to film.His work on the Dark Knight trilogy as well as movies including The Prestige, Inception and Dunkirk brought him blockbuster success as well as an Oscar nomination.Please review our commenting policyAlison Saunders, much-criticised former CPS chief, becomes first not to receive top honourOne in ten members of clergy victims of violence as anti-Christian hate crimes risesScotland rugby great Doddie Weir among more than 100 Scots recognised in New Year HonoursExclusive: Civil servant accuses ministers of \u0026#39Project Fear Mark III\u0026#39 over no-deal BrexitComment: Of course no-deal has been planned for – but does the Government want you to think otherwise?Sajid Javid resists calls for more boats to tackle Channel migrants - as he declares a \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39Lawyers who drew up Sir Philip Green gagging orders should face inquiry, says MPComment: The ABC Murders is excruciating liberal-Left drivel at its most spectacularGetty oil tycoon\u0026#39s grandson is caught up in row about privacy near Buckinghamshire pileComment: Voters deserve an apology from us Leaver optimists who naively told them MPs would honour the referendum Comment: From vegans to Brexit, us farmers are preparing to battle through one heck of a 2019Rolling Stones fan accuses the band of discriminating against disabled peopleBrewery apologies after use of Hindu symbol on beer bottle sparks protestMP facing jail for lying to police to avoid speeding fine vows to stay on in ParliamentTrump threatens to seal off US-Mexico border \u0026#39entirely\u0026#39 if Congress does not agree funding for a wallNetflix releases Black Mirror episode where viewers choose the endingSajid Javid declares a \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39 as number of migrants trying to cross English Channel continues to riseMurderer feigned concern for employee he left to die in shop explosionHow ancient cures could be key to tackling superbugsAustralia braces for record-breaking temperatures as heatwave hits continentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/28/TELEMMGLPICT000154488508_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbNWtAZp4M83CNbYcU41Ja5PBtShq1Cx9HGnISD2SOrk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"primary school children told ditch gadgets write letter instead","story":"Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wants children to learn resilience Department for EducationPrimary school children will be told to ditch the gadgets and write a letter instead in new government ‘bucket lists’.The Department of Education has announced that teachers and parents will be receiving lists of activities in the New Year for children to complete, which aim to build their “character, drive, resilience”.Among the activities children will be encouraged to do are painting a self portrait, posting a letter, going on a hike, planning and cooking a meal and flying a kite.The scheme has received the backing of a host of children’s charities and organisations including the Scouts, Girlguiding, the National Trust and Action for Children.Announcing the scheme, Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: “I regularly hear from teachers that it’s important that children have the chance to try things out, to get a taste of the world around them, to see and do things that they wouldn’t normally do, or go to places they wouldn’t normally go.“Experience is a great teacher and can equip children with valuable skills that prepare for any challenges life may throw at them. What’s on the inside – someone’s character, drive, resilience, and the ability to stick to a goal - is just as important as their academic achievements.”Mr Hinds said he was inspired to create the initiative after visiting St Werburgh’s Primary School, in Bristol, where every child is encouraged to complete list of extra-curricular tasks.It said teachers will be able to tailor the lists, which will be sent out in January, to better reflect their area’s and pupils’ needs.Matt Hyde, Chief Executive of the Scouts, said: “We know how much young people get out of enrichment activities like these: broadening their experiences, having fun and developing skills for life.“Not everything can be taught in a classroom, so it\u0027s great to see Department for Education recognising the value of extra-curricular activities and encouraging young people to build confidence, resilience and get involved in their communities as well.”The children’s charity, the National Children’s Bureau, also welcomed the scheme saying it could help ease the surging rates of mental health problems being reported in schools.Anna Feuchtwang, Chief Executive of the National Children’s Bureau, added: “Part of the remedy lies in developing a firm foundation of wellbeing and resilience in children and young people, both at home and at school.”Department for EducationPlease review our commenting policyAlison Saunders, much-criticised former CPS chief, becomes first not to receive top honourSir Michael Palin to celebrate knighthood with a \u0026#39glass of Horlicks\u0026#39 and an early nightOne in ten members of clergy victims of violence as anti-Christian hate crimes risesScotland rugby great Doddie Weir among more than 100 Scots recognised in New Year HonoursExclusive: Civil servant accuses ministers of \u0026#39Project Fear Mark III\u0026#39 over no-deal BrexitComment: Of course no-deal has been planned for – but does the Government want you to think otherwise?Sajid Javid resists calls for more boats to tackle Channel migrants - as he declares a \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39Lawyers who drew up Sir Philip Green gagging orders should face inquiry, says MPComment: The ABC Murders is excruciating liberal-Left drivel at its most spectacularGetty oil tycoon\u0026#39s grandson is caught up in row about privacy near Buckinghamshire pileComment: Voters deserve an apology from us Leaver optimists who naively told them MPs would honour the referendum Comment: From vegans to Brexit, us farmers are preparing to battle through one heck of a 2019Rolling Stones fan accuses the band of discriminating against disabled peopleBrewery apologies after use of Hindu symbol on beer bottle sparks protestMP facing jail for lying to police to avoid speeding fine vows to stay on in ParliamentTrump threatens to seal off US-Mexico border \u0026#39entirely\u0026#39 if Congress does not agree funding for a wallNetflix releases Black Mirror episode where viewers choose the endingSajid Javid declares a \u0026#39major incident\u0026#39 as number of migrants trying to cross English Channel continues to riseMurderer feigned concern for employee he left to die in shop explosionHow ancient cures could be key to tackling superbugsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/14/11/amazon-echo.jpg","title":"amazon echo not working alexa issues understanding outage","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In “Playtest”, starring Wyatt Russell, the front cover of\u0026nbspEdge\u0026nbspmagazine indicates that there is a review of “Bandersnatch”\u0026nbspinside. In the scene, Sonja uses the magazine to encourage Cooper to take a mysterious job with video game company SaitoGemu.\u0026nbspThe episode opens with Stefan at home with his father, a widow, offering him a choice of breakfast cereal (the first decision the user is faced with). From there, he travels to an interview with a\u0026nbspgames company so he can pitch his idea for a game adaptation of the multiple choice novel, Bandersnatch, which was written by a man who descended into madness as he completed it.\u0026nbspAt the office, he is introduced to Colin Ritman\u0026nbsp(Coulter), Stefan\u0027s hero, and a man with whom you can have either a lot or barely any interaction with, depending on the choices you make. Throughout the film there are loops that guide you back to the correct narrative if you stray too far, such as when Stefan is asked whether he wants to work in the office or at home, on his own. The home option is preferred as it leads to Stefan\u0027s own slow descent into madness as he becomes obsessed with completing Bandersnatch.As he works, he becomes more and more irritated by interruptions from his father, and trips to his therapist. You can learn during therapy\u0026nbsp(as we did in this version of the story) that his mother died in a train crash after Stefan caused her to miss an earlier train – an event that likely triggered\u0026nbsphis current mental health issues.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

Bandersnatch is released to rave reviews, as a current-day news report informs us that Stefan was later arrested and charged with his father\u0027s murder.\u0026nbspThis writer was slightly sceptical at how Netflix is managing to get viewers to watch the episode countless times to see the various endings... meaning mega streams for them. At first the interactions are fun, but the constant interruptions to the story as you\u0027re asked to make yet another decision on Stefan\u0027s behalf can become\u0026nbspquite wearisome, and if anything it pulls you out of the story rather than allowing\u0026nbspyou to become engrossed in it.Netflix says of the new interactive film: “There are choices to be made, challenges to overcome, dangers to encounter and, as always in life (and Black Mirror), consequences to be had.

After the highs of 2017, which saw the price of bitcoin surge to $20,000 (£15,700), the world\u0027s most valuable cryptocurrency is currently trading close to its lowest point in 16 months.Bitcoin has fallen\u0026nbspby 3 per cent over the last 24 hours, adding to losses of 5 per cent in the last week, 10 per cent in the last month and almost 80 per cent over the last year – leaving little doubt\u0026nbspthat last year\u0027s peak was indeed the result of an over-inflated bubble.There have been five major price spikes in bitcoin\u0027s 10 year history, and after each previous crash the market has managed to recover to even higher levels. But the scale of the 2018 losses have left some cryptocurrency experts questioning whether bitcoin will once again see a market turn-around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPredicting bitcoin\u0027s fortunes in 2019 has therefore ided analysts, with forecasts from high-profile figures within the cryptocurrency industry ranging from a complete capitulation, to a 10-fold increase from today\u0027s price of $3,650.The most radical predictions come from bitcoin cash founder Calvin Ayre and Fundstrat\u0026nbspco-founder Thomas Lee.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography.

And I love him and that – I don’t blame him. But I was angry, and I got into trouble,” he says.“I had the Old Bill round my gaff every five minutes. I was a wrong ’un. No one knew how to help me. Then I found a father figure I didn’t even know I needed.“I went for an audition for a play and I met this old geezer who wrote it. He was an East Ender, he was a West Ham fan just like me. He thought I was alright and he gave me the part. Turns out it was a fella called Harold Pinter.“He became the most influential man in my life… He taught me that where I came from didn’t dictate where I went to.”He goes on to add: “Life can get a little stressful and we might get on each other’s nerves a bit, but remember how much there is to be proud of, to be grateful of, and get yourself a Harold, you know, if you can … Merry Christmas, my loves.”Danny Dyer’s Alternative Christmas Message airs on Christmas Day at 3.50pm on Channel 4Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal.

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/17/instagram.jpg","title":"instagram update latest scrolling why reverse old version guide swipe","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The message that pops up when the update arrives offers some clue about why this happened: Stories.Instagram update completely changes how users scroll through feedInstagram notes that the feature is more similar to the Stories tool that rolled out in 2016, allowing people to post disappearing photos and videos that could be clicked through in exactly the same way. It even tells people that they can use the same feed in just the same way.Since 2016, Stories has become probably the most quickly growing kind of media ever to be launched: not just on Instagram but everywhere on the web, the side-swiping, clicky way of getting through an app has spread itself across the entire internet. Instagram Stories is now twice as big as rival Snapchat, and makes up a major part of the way people use the app.Presumably excited by the vast popularity of those Stories, Instagram has decided to make everything else work that way, too.It is worth noting that even as Stories have gone from strength to strength, and Instagram has continued to grow, the company\u0027s founders also recently left the company. That was because of disputes with owners Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the direction of the company, according to a report in Bloomberg\u0026nbsp– and it may be that features such as these were the cause of those disagreements.It seems to be on its way to everybody, though that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll definitely have got it yet. Force quitting the app and scrolling around a little appears to make the new feature most likely to arrive.Usually, new Instagram features – especially ones like this, which bring dramatic changes – are rolled out slowly, to a small group of people first and then gradually to everybody else. But this appears to have come in one fell swoop, on Thursday afternoon UK time.They hate it. Almost everybody seems to absolutely despise the update.Searching for the word Instagram on Twitter brings a whole host of posts, many including explicit language unfit for this website.Give me back my timeline, one illustrative but relatively family-friendly post reads.\u0026nbspThis update SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: no. Instagram isn\u0027t giving its users the ability to use the old format, even temporarily: once the update has arrived, it has arrived forever, by the looks of things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/09/02/08/crrbjjdxyae7doo.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-4633446  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/09/02/08/crrbjjdxyae7doo.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 leak camera feature specs dslr bokeh lens release","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

My mum has been here since 1960. London is her home. She came here, fell in love, had myself and my sisters and brought us up here. We’re all proud of being British,” she told The Independent.Cazzato (right) and her 87-year-old mother Ana\u0026nbspMaria Dance“It’s the first I’d heard of it and at first I thought it may be a joke, but it looks like it’s not.

I know a lot of Spanish people and Italian people who have been here for years and it’s going to affect them too.”EU national Dion Di Miceli, who has lived and worked in the UK for 30 years taxpayer, said: “I should pay money to continue living in my home? And what about those who are unable to fill in these forms, such as elderly EU nationals with dementia?”Johnny Taylor echoed his sentiments, tweeting: “Why should my partner who has lived and worked here for almost 14 years have to apply?“It’s an insult to her and the millions of other EU nationals who have contributed to the UK economy.

A disastrous idea from HuntAt customs in the Russian capital Ms Brady told the receptionist about the horses’ ordeal which “elicited in response the sad tale of the Finnish ambassador’s parrot”.The cable goes on: “The receptionist, an animal-lover and close to tears at the thought of the parrot, relented and led us through a maze of ceiling-high packing cases in the enormous warehouse.\u0026nbsp“And there we found the staff of the twelfth diplomatic customs post playing poker.“Fifteen dollars poorer but with the customs formalities completed we hotfooted it to the station accounts office in south Moscow.”Finding that office closed, they returned the next day to discover that as the horses had been in the station for 24 hours they needed to be re-checked by a vet.The cable continues: “The vet was in her office adding up extremely slowly a long list of figures on a calculator with dodgy batteries.\u0026nbsp“The numbers kept fading, at which point she began again at the top of the list.”\u0026nbspAfter an hour of this frustrating scene they got the necessary paperwork.But as preparations were made to transport the horse-box Ms Brady noticed the three grooms who had travelled with the animals “began to carry countless sacks of potatoes, onions, carrots and at least 200 large melons”.It adds: “One groom explained that as Turkmenistan had no post-1992 banknotes they were forced to bring wares to sell in Moscow to be able to buy the return ticket to\u0026nbspAshkabad.”The manure-filled carriage had to be cleaned before they could leave the railway siding, so a train driver was bribed with “several particularly large” melons to move down the track where it could be “unceremoniously scraped out onto the track”.With both horses finally in quarantine awaiting transit, Ms Brady signs off: “I have made some useful contacts over the last few days so the next time we want to import a horse to Russia it will be a doddle.”Mr Major wrote a thank-you note, saying: “Your splendid account of how to put a\u0026nbspTurkmeni\u0026nbsphorse into quarantine was the most enjoyable document the Private Office have put into my weekend box in a very long time.“I am most grateful to you for your valiant and amusing efforts, in this noble cause.”Created with Sketch.

independent equine experts who was helping get the horse to the UK, had a conviction for fraud.After the story was published, senior civil servants advised the prime minister against accepting Mr Meddes’ offer to withdraw from the operation on the grounds that the horseman had “served his sentence for his crime, so it’s a bit odd if we bar him from helping”.But in a handwritten note, a senior civil servant made it clear he was looking forward for foreign office guidance on “the general position of the horse, when will it arrive, and when can we forget the whole saga”.Maksat\u0026nbspeventually settled in stables in Carmarthenshire, Wales after being deemed too temperamental by the Household Cavalry.Stable-owner Lorna Winn-Jones, who took him in, told

It’s a US Coast Guard photo and was published in All Hands magazine shortly after.”That ship did not take part in the Normandy landings.On the US National World War II museum website, the image is captioned: “USS LCI(L)-30 landing troops carrying stretchers onto a beach during a second assault\u0026nbspwave”. It states the picture was\u0026nbsptaken on 17 May, 1944 – three weeks before the D-Day landings nearly 8,500 miles away.Military historian Andy Saunders branded the stamp a “shambles”. He added: “Wrong theatre wrong date wrong vessel wrong troops.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

With ministers now promising a total of around 2,500 per year until 2022, it means the increased funding will deliver\u0026nbsponly an additional 1,000 each year.In contrast, 39,402 were built\u0026nbspin 2009-10 –\u0026nbspthe year before the Conservatives came to power.In October, Ms May announced that her government was increasing\u0026nbspfunding for the\u0026nbspAffordable Homes Programme by £2bn, taking the total to almost\u0026nbsp£9bn.Heralding the move, the prime minister said she was making it\u0026nbspher personal “mission” to tackle the housing crisis and assured those in need of\u0026nbspa better home that “help is on\u0026nbspthe way”.But in answer to a parliamentary question from Labour, housing secretary James Brokenshire said just one in 20 of the new homes to be built\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspbe social homes.\u0026nbspHe said: “The £9bn Affordable Homes Programme will deliver at least 250,000 homes by March 2022. At least 12,500 of these will be for social rent outside of London.“The Greater London Authority has the flexibility to deliver social rent in London.”Commenting on the revelation,\u0026nbspJohn Healey, Labour’s shadow housing secretary, said: “There’s been a disastrous fall in the number of new genuinely affordable homes for social rent under the Conservatives. We are now building over 30,000 fewer social rented homes a year than when I was Labour’s last housing minister in 2010.“Ministers’ flawed definition of ‘affordable housing’ includes homes for sale at up to £450,000 and to let at 80 per cent of market rents, so it’s just not good enough for ministers to only commit a tiny fraction of the affordable homes budget to new social rented homes. The next Labour government will build a million low-cost homes, the majority for social rent.”Addressing the Conservative Party conference in October, Ms May promised “a new generation of council houses to help fix our broken housing market”.She said: “In those parts of the country where need is greatest we will allow social rented housing to be built, at well below market levels, getting the government back into the business of building houses.”And during the 2017 election campaign, Ms May promised the Tories would deliver “a new generation of social rented homes”.44bn to supporting the housing marketHousing charities condemned the revelation\u0026nbspthat the\u0026nbspgovernment will only fund 2,500 new social homes per year.Greg Beales,\u0026nbspcampaign director of\u0026nbspShelter, said: “The gap between the number of social homes we need in this country and how many get built is vast. In fact, we delivered 84 per cent\u0026nbspfewer social homes this year than in 2010. This is totally unacceptable when hundreds of thousands of people are homeless and millions more are struggling in unstable and expensive private renting.\u0026nbsp“It is time the government charted a new course and seriously ramped up its efforts to get more social homes built. That’s why Shelter has launched an independent commission into the future of social housing that will soon set out a bold and far-reaching vision for the pivotal role it has to play in ending the housing crisis.”And Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said: “It is very disappointing to see such a tiny proportion of the properties to be delivered through the Affordable Homes Programme being made available for social rent. Research shows we need 90,000 social homes built every year for the next 15 years to meet demand – both for those experiencing homelessness, and for those on low incomes, many of whom are at risk of homelessness.“The current lack of genuinely affordable housing is leaving thousands living on a knife-edge, unable to keep up with spiralling rents and housing costs.”Kit Malthouse, housing minister, said:\u0026nbsp“Over the last three decades governments of all stripes have built too few homes of all types, including for affordable and social rent.“We’re correcting this with massive investment in house building, including the £9bn affordable homes programme, but also by setting councils free to build the social homes their communities need.“We expect many thousands of new homes to result and we share the impatience of the British people to see decent homes built for the next generation.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I want us to have a vote as soon as possible, that’s what I’ve been saying for the past two weeks, and if that means recalling parliament to have the vote let’s have it.\u0026nbsp“But it looks to me the government has once again reneged on that and tried to put it back another week.\u0026nbspWe need to have that vote so\u0026nbspa decision of parliament can be made. What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”Corbyn hails the Good Samaritan in Christmas messageThe House was last recalled during the EU referendum campaign in June 2016 to pay tributes to the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox. This was the 29th recall during a recess period since 1948.\u0026nbspOther issues MPs have been ordered back to Westminster over included a debate over the use of chemical weapons in Syria in 2013, and the riots in London and other English cities in 2011.In order for parliament to be recalled,\u0026nbspthe speaker of the Commons, John Bercow, must receive a formal request from the government which he would\u0026nbspthen consider and make a judgement on.As it stands, MPs will return on 7 January after a two week Christmas recess, but the prime minister has already summoned her cabinet a week earlier on 2 January to discuss no-deal preparations.Corbyn pledges to end law which criminalises rough sleepersMr Corbyn added that the government should not have gone into recess without a vote on the deal: “The prime minister and the Tory chief whip agreed the timetable motion, we agreed the timetable motion which was a five day debate, and it was put at that time at that week to ensure the select committees could have a chance over a week to comment on the agreement before it was put to parliament.“I agreed with...\u0026nbspI thought that was a sensible way of doing it. You would have the process in the EU, you had Theresa May agreeing it with the EU, you then had a short gap, about a week, in which everyone could analyse it and consider it and then come back to the House for a five day debate and then a vote.”He continued: “Three days into that they, the government, unilaterally pulled it and that shows the weakness of the system in the House of Commons where essentially the government holds the aces because they control the programme.“I said this to the parliamentary Labour Party and it\u0026nbspwas seen as a slightly odd thing to say – I said, actually, for a party that wants to go into government, I want to see the House of Commons stronger than it is, not weaker than it is, because\u0026nbspgovernments should be held to account by the parliament.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The steam locomotive U Class 31806 makes its way past Corfe Castle during the Winter Warm Up on the Swanage Railway in DorsetThe scene in Launcelot Close, Andover, where the body of a man has been found after an explosion caused a building to collapseShoppers enter the Selfridges store on Oxford Street during the Boxing Day sales in LondonBarbary macaques at Blair Drummond Safari Park have a great time finding the tasty morsels hidden amongst the wrapped parcels given to them by keepers.

Asked to pinpoint the most difficult moment of 2018, Mr Corbyn said it was “bringing the party together over attitudes towards Brexit and the European Union”.\u0026nbspHe said the unanimity achieved at party conference was designed to bring both leavers and remainers together on two things: “The direction of social and economic policy by the Labour Party, and the other is of course the relationship with the European Union.”Now Mr Corbyn is facing demands from anti-Brexit activists within the party to convene an emergency conference to reevaluate the party’s strategy in the coming weeks – ahead of any vote – but the Labour leader said he did not “at this stage see the need for a special conference”.“A special conference would take some time to organise anyway,” he added. “I think we do have the agreement of conference on the overall position, and we do have a very large and representative national executive. But obviously if the national executive wanted to hold a special conference they would say so, but I have not had any indications of that from members.”In the interview, Mr Corbyn also claimed he was “totally” ready for any snap election, saying the party had already selected candidates in all of its marginal seats.\u0026nbspOne path towards a general election would be through tabling a motion of no confidence in the government. If it passed and a new government attracting the support of a majority of the House cannot be formed within 14 days, parliament is dissolved and a vote triggered.Pressed on whether Labour intends to make such a move in the coming weeks, Mr Corbyn said: “We’ve made clear it’s a question of when not if we do a vote of no confidence in the government, and obviously we do at a time when their confidence is the lowest ever, which I suspect will be after they’ve lost the vote.”\u0026nbspHe would not be “tied to a date”, but said if Ms May loses the vote “we will obviously make our views clear in the House”.“I’m not certain what the result would be,” he added. “We would obviously put a case of no confidence with the government at an appropriate time.”But if Mr Corbyn’s wish of forcing a snap election fails to come to fruition, the next vote is scheduled for May 2022 – and the prime minister has already said on the record she will hand over the keys to No 10 to one of her Tory colleagues before that vote.\u0026nbspIf he remains in post as Labour leader, Mr Corbyn will be facing his third prime minister as Labour leader. He chose not to name who his preferred challenger would be when Ms May resigns, however, and said he did not want to “ruin somebody’s chances by naming a favourite”.Asked whether he ever felt sorry for the prime minister – an emotion expressed by the former Labour leader Tony Blair – Mr Corbyn said: “At a human level I have great interest in other people and I often feel sympathy for the positions people have got themselves into.\u0026nbsp“But then I also look at her cabinet, look at the decisions they are making, look at the way in which universal credit impacts on the poorest, look at the levels of poverty around this country, and I feel angry and disgusted that we are just tolerating the institutionalisation of food banks, begging, rough sleeping in this country.\u0026nbsp“No, it’s a symptom of a deep malaise of 10 years of frozen wages and lack of investment.”Due to the unremitting sense of crisis at the top of the government and a prime minister struggling to retain any degree of authority, one of the criticisms often levelled at Mr Corbyn is that Labour should now be at least 10 points ahead in the opinion polls. Instead, the party is often on a level pegging with the Conservatives.\u0026nbspWhen questioned on this, Mr Corbyn replied: “I wish we had even more support than we do have, but we have fought many election campaigns, many local election campaigns, and we did win councils that people said would be very difficult to win back.\u0026nbsp“I would also say, generally speaking, the only time that the majority of the media have given us anything like a fair hearing was during the election campaign, and rapidly after the election campaign they reverted to type and we’ve had unremitting hostility from most of the media ever since then, and we continue to have it.”Referring to an incident in the Commons last week when he was accused of calling the prime minister a “stupid woman” – he later denied this, saying he said “stupid people” – Mr Corbyn said Labour’s strength was getting out its message through social media.\u0026nbspPMQs session\u0026nbspFollowing the bustup in the chamber, the Islington North MP said a video produced by his team the following day, which also criticised the media, received half a million views in just a few hours.\u0026nbspBut before he intends to build on the party’s social media output and daily campaign work, Mr Corbyn said he will bring in the new year with his wife, Laura Alvarez.\u0026nbsp“I don’t drink so there’s not much celebration in that sense,” he said. “We will enjoy the new year, Laura and I. We look forward to a new\u0026nbspyear.\u0026nbspAnd I always make sure in my own life that I\u0026nbspwork very hard at my job – and I do a lot of travelling and working and I love being a constituency MP – but I also make sure I have other things to do.

– all of whom had backed Leave in the 2016 referendum – were awarded knighthoods or damehoods.They included Graham Brady, the chairman of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, who went on to play a crucial role when his fellow Conservatives finally triggered a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.In an attempt to reassure supporters of his convictions, Mr\u0026nbspRedwood\u0026nbsppublished a blog days before the honour outlining, “Eight things wrong with the withdrawal agreement”.The former banker, who ran the Downing Street policy unit under

“brings dishonour on the honours system”.“I cannot see how it is anything but a desperate attempt to blunt criticism of the prime minister’s Brexit deal by dangling a knighthood or two in front of MPs,” the Best for Britain supporter said.“This is all happening just a couple of weeks before the critical Brexit vote.”Mr Streeter, 63, who voted Remain in 2016, has spoken out in favour of the prime minister’s Brexit deal.The former minister, who has represented Plymouth Sutton since 1992 and then South West Devon since 1997, said: “I am deeply honoured.“As far as I am concerned, I want to dedicate the award to my wife and family for supporting me through the last quarter of a century at Westminster, which has involved sacrifice on their part.”Long-serving Labour whip Mr Campbell also received a knighthood, which he welcomed as a recognition of his work in his Tynemouth constituency.\u0026nbspWhitehall honours included a knighthood for Roy Stone after more than 40 years in the civil service under seven prime ministers, and a CBE for\u0026nbspMs May’s\u0026nbspdeputy principal private secretary, William Macfarlane.Around\u0026nbsp70 per cent of awards were handed\u0026nbspto

When it is strong, the vortex is concentrated over the Arctic or Antarctic area.But when it is weak – which is more frequent – it can split into two or more freezing vortices.The phenomenon associated with wintry weather is known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming.These cover a larger area and can move south to Canada, the USA and Europe, increasing the risk of air temperatures decreasing to potentially dangerous levels."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/as-kavanagh-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"all starts in spring brexit opinion","story":"Not only has Mrs May made me look foolish by clinging to her job, she seems to have defied gravity and learned how to fly.The PM has pencilled in another year’s lease on No and could even survive until the next Election — perhaps within that same year. This might not be good news to those who, like me, believe she has made a dog’s Brexit of EU negotiations, but it would be unchristian on Christmas Eve to ignore Mrs May’s transformation.She seems almost to have shrugged off the crushing burden of responsibility and begun to enjoy herself. Voters have noticed. At ious pre-Christmas gatherings, I have been struck by expressions of warmth for Mrs May personally, even among hardened Brexiteers.So, in the spirit of Christmas, let’s put dferences aside and raise a glass to the PM’s health and happiness.She has benefited from the ghastliness of her enemies — the thuggish European Commision, drunken groper Jean Claude Juncker, biased Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow and snide Jeremy Corbyn. Their mean-spirited sneers have stirred a passion for the underdog among fair-minded Brits — surprisingly, more among men than women.It is refreshing to see bellowing toad Bercow, a toxic stain on the centuries-old tradition of Speaker impartiality, finally at bay over allegations of abuse of his high office. Bercow’s blatant contempt for Parliament coincides with Corbyn’s disintegration and Labour’s irrelevance.Only last week Corbyn was held up as the scary monster who would eat us alivegiven the chance. Today he stands shredded for all to see, as a pathetic non-entity who somehow became Leader of HM Opposition.Corbyn feebly denies live TV evidence of him branding Theresa May a “stupid woman”.  He is entitled to his opinion but it is demeaning to lie about it. No wonder two of his closest MPs, Fiona Onasanya and Kate Osamor, have also been caught lying through their teeth. And they are just the ones brought to the attention of police.Suddenly, far from Corbyn sweeping to power as Britain’s first Marxist PM, polls suggest he would be thrashed in a snap Election, with the Tories regaining their outright majority.  But perhaps not under this leader.Which brings me to another reason to be cheerful. Boris Johnson has been cleared of trumped-up charges of Islamophobia levelled by Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, spurred on by Mrs May herself.In an article supporting the right of Muslim women to wear what they like, Boris warned hijabs made them look like bank robbers or “letter boxes”.As with much of the ridicule hurled at Boris since Brexit, this was calculated to undermine his chances of winning any future leadership battle. But the really good news this festive season is the panic beginning to grip those who want to reverse the  referendum and keep Britain in Europe at any cost.Project Fear has become Project Farce. Fanatical Remoaners, not Brexiteeers, can be seen as the real swivel-eyed loonies.Time is running out — and it isn’t on their side. Either they accept Mrs May’s dodgy deal by March  or we’re OUT. As Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom explains, MPs cannot block Brexit.Far from being frightened off, foreign firms are pouring cash into UKplc. Savvy tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon have bet billions on post-Brexit Britain.  More firms are setting up HQs in London than any other EU capital and Britain has been voted the best country in the world to do business.We have just marked the wintry Shortest Day, a symbolic turning point, with the best jobs record in jobless Europe while the Eurozone faces an economic disaster. We are a long way short of high summer.But every day from now until the end of daylight- saving in March, things should get brighter and brighter. Have a wonderful Christmas and a terric New Year.AND finally, the best news of all. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne was filleted live on Saturday’s Today programme by BBC veteran David Dimbleby.Perhaps expecting an easy ride from a fellow Remainer, Georgie Boy was accused of cutting and running after the  referendum – and using his Treasury job to feather his nest.Comparing Osborne to greedy ex-PM Tony Blair, Dimbleby asked: “Why are you following in his foot-steps by taking job after job and earning millions of pounds a year  You became prominent because you were Chancellor.It’s as though going into politics – which you aban-doned when it turned against you – was a pathway to what you do now, making a buck.”The sound of spluttering could be heard.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

bringing the state to a standstill.The drastic step is proposed as a way of forcing Theresa May to carry out a dramatic U-turn and back a rerun of the  vote.Pro-EU campaign group Best for Britain has published a new report recommending the wrecking tactic.It suggests MPs should vote down the PMs deal next month, then vote to rule out a No Deal outcome.The document says: The clearest opportunity for replacing no deal as the default option is through political pressure via the Finance Bill.The key point is that income tax and corporation tax are annual taxes, authorisation of which runs out at the end of the tax year.MPs could in theory pass an amendment blocking the Government from collecting the levies, which make up a third of all tax revenue.The proposed amendment to the Finance Bill would state that no taxes can be collected until the PM calls a second referendum on Brexit.It would be up to Speaker John Bercow to decide whether or not the amendment can be voted on.Another suggestion would see MPs block the Government from bringing any bills to the Commons unless ministers cave on Brexit.The report, drawn up with the help of lawyer and ex-MP David Howarth, lays out four options for Parliament to take control of the process.In a foreword Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve said: There are routes not yet properly explored, examined or voted upon which the Prime Minister appears to be attempting to close off.Instead Downing Street threatens a catastrophic No Deal should the Prime Minister’s deal fail to be delivered through Parliament.As parliamentarians, we have a duty to examine every option open to us which would avoid such an outcome.”Mrs Mays deal will go to a vote in Parliament in mid-January - but the PM needs to win over dozens more MPsshe is to avoid a humiliating defeat.If the Government loses, Britain will be on course to leave the EU without a deal, but MPs are likely to put pressure on Mrs May to hold a second referendum instead.She has always insisted thats out of the question, but earlier this month ally Amber Rudd suggested it would be better than a No Deal outcome."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT0004581893721-e1546008805811.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit deal theresa may commons jeremy hunt","story":"In a boost for the under-fire PM, the Foreign Secretary insisted she has a good chance of success in next months Commons vote.Mr Hunt called on Brussels to fix the hated Irish backstop -

One senior aide to the Prime Minister told the Mirror the eurocrat was the UK’s “best hope” of reaching agreement with the EU, conceding that he was “put on this earth to negotiate”. The Government is now hoping to get other EU leaders to sign up to a start date for the UK’s trading relationship with the bloc which could mean the controversial Irish border back stop could be avoided. They believe this could be done without reopening the orce deal, which Brussels has ruled out, but could nevertheless carry the legal force demanded by the PM’s Brexiteer critics.  Donald Tusk, the influential European Council President, will also play a key role in whether sceptical EU states can be persuaded to offer more. Britain’s focus is now on pushing for enough assurances from Brussels to get the Democratic Unionist Party, who the Tories rely on to prop up their fragile Government, on board, in the hope sceptical Tories will follow. However, the senior No  insider admitted that Mr Juncker and Mr Tusk have their work cut out in winning over the likes of French president Emmanuel Macron and Irish premier Leo Varadkhar. They conceded that December’s Brussels summit could have gone better, with Mr Juncker describing the PM’s Brexit plans as “nebulous and imprecise ” and Mrs May leaving virtually empty handed. “A lot of this will come down to Juncker and how much he wants to get a Brexit deal. He was put on this earth to negotiate. We hope that he’ll be able to help us get what we need to get the DUP on board,” the source said.  Other government insiders claimed that talks just before Christmas with the DUP had been more promising than before, when the party firmly ruled out backing Mrs May’s deal. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday warned that the EU must provide further assurances over the backstop, the fall-back plan for the border,the PM’s deal is to make it through Parliament. He told the BBC the backstop was the only “outstanding issue” and he believed it could be solved, noting that the EU had already agreed it was temporary. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here. “I think MPs, as they reflect on how close we are to an agreement, but also how cataclysmic it would bewe didn’t end up having an agreement we could get through Parliament, the best thing is to put our heads down and make sure we have a version of this agreement we can get through Parliament,” he said.

But there are also awards for Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan, Downton Abbeys Jim Carter and authors Philip Pullman and Margaret Atwood. And a cronyism row is set to brew after Theresa May rewarded big business chiefs who just happen to back her Brexit deal. There are plenty of famous faces in the honours list - but far more people who quietly work away at doing good for their communities. So to honour them all, we’ve reproduced the list in full - and highlights - below.  Overall, , recipients are named in the  New Year list. That includes the  people recognised for their acts responding to the terror attacks in Manchester and London in . Some  women are recognised in the list, representing % of the total, the lowest percentage since . Overall % of those being honoured come from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background, % consider themselves disabled and % identy as LGBT. Youth magazine founder Saeed Atcha, , is the youngest to be recognised, with an MBE for services to young people and the community in Greater Manchester. The oldest is -year-old World War Two veteran Robert Lingwood, who gets a BEM for services to the community in County Tyrone. The heroes in the community   people who responded to the Manchester and London terror attacks have been named in the New Year Honours. Among them is Special Sergeant Jared Simpson, one of the first officers on the scene at the Manchester Arena on the night of  May last year. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi had just detonated a homemade device laden with shrapnel in the lobby of the Arena at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, killing  people, the youngest just eight years old. “My first thought is always for the victim or victims that have been affected by whatever I am dealing with, and they will always be my first priority,” Sgt Simpson said, after learning of his British Empire Medal for services to policing. Other honours include an OBE for Paul Woodrow, Director of Operations at the London Ambulance Service an OBE for Joy Ongcachuy, a theatre nurse at Barts Hospital and a BEM for Theresa Lam, the Family Liaison Lead for Greater Manchester Police. British ers who helped save a youth football team trapped inside a flooded cave in Thailand are also honoured.   Vernon Unsworth, the ex-pat suing Tesla entrepreneur Elon Musk for labelling him a pedo guy, is among those getting MBEs for their roles in the dramatic Thai cave rescue, which gripped the world during the summer. Divers Joshua Bratchley and Lance Corporal Connor Roe both get MBEs, while four more British cave ers are receiving civilian gallantry awards. Seven firefighters who saved elderly residents from a serious blaze at a care home in Cheshunt in  are also honoured.

An OBE also goes to Mark Prince for tackling kne and gang crime in London after the heart-rending experience of losing his son aged . No awards will go to anyone involved in Grenfell Tower relief work until the public inquiry has concluded following talks with emergency services and community groups, organisers said. The sports stars  In sport, England football captain Harry Kane gets an MBE while national team manager Gareth Southgate gets an OBE, both for services to football and in recognition of Englands semi-final run at the  World Cup. But fans could be angered by an OBE for outgoing Premier League chief Richard Scudamore - topping up his poundm departure bonus. Former England cricket captain Alastair Cook is knighted for services to cricket while Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas gets an upgrade from MBE to OBE to add to his BBC Sports Personality of the Year  accolade. Former footballer Leroy Rosenior, now vice-president of Show Racism the Red Card, gets an MBE for services to tackling discrimination in sport. Motor neurone disease sufferer and former Scottish rugby player George Doddie Weir gets an OBE for services to rugby, motor neurone disease research, and the community in the Scottish Borders. The political cronyism   Theresa May was embroiled in a cronyism row last night after she announced that a prominent Brexiteer had been made a privy counsellor ahead of her meaningful vote on Brexit. Sir Edward Leigh, who has yet to announce how he will vote on the deal, said earlier this month that the Prime Minister’s efforts to secure concessions from Brussels could yet pay off. Two other Tory MPs who have both said they will back the Prime Minister’s plans were also appointed to the secretive official body - Philip Dunne and Sir Roger Gale. It came after hardline Brexiteer John Redwood - one of the Eurosceptic Cabinet ministers branded “bastards” by John Major - was knighted in the New Year’s Honours list. With the crunch vote due next month, speculation has been swirling at Westminster honours may be deployed as a means of luring MPs to back the Prime Minister. In an apparent bid to reassure supporters that he will not be swayed by his gong, Mr Redwood published a blog just days ahead of the announcement outlining “Eight things wrong with the withdrawal agreement”. Tory MP Gary Streeter, who backed Remain in the  referendum and has already made clear that he will support the PM, also received a knighthood. Tory donor John H J Lewis, who has given thousands of pounds to the party, was awarded an OBE for philanthropt and supporting the arts. Airbus UK chief Katherine Bennett, whose company had warned it might reconsider its investment in the UK in light of Brexit, but has now offered cautious support for the PM’s plan, gets an OBE. German-born Siemens UK chief Juumlrgen Maier, who has also backed Mrs May’s deal over crashing out without a deal, receives a CBE. Labour party chair Ian Lavery said: “It is insulting to those who make valuable contributions to society that the Tories for years have continued to use the honours system to award their own Conservative grandees and party donors.” Whitehall honours include a knighthood for HMRC chief executive Jon Thompson who received death threats after disclosing that a customs option preferred by Brexiteers would cost up to poundbn. Knighthoods also go to Richard Heaton, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, Laurie Bristow, the UK ambassador to Moscow who dealt with the fall-out from the Salisbury poisoning and Roy Stone, who has served under seven PMs, latterly as an aide to the chief whip. Mrs May’s deputy principal private secretary, William Macfarlane, gets a CBE for public service.STARS OF THE ARTS Twiggy   Twiggy joked that it has been purgatory keeping the news of being made a Dame a secret. The model, born Lesley Hornby and dubbed the worlds first supermodel, has been awarded the title in the Queens New Year Honours list for her services to fashion, the arts and charity. The -year-old told the Press Association: Its wonderful, but it makes me giggle. When we wake up every morning we turn to each other, my husbandand I, and we just giggle. So its a very nice, warm feeling, and obviously I am very honoured. The hardest thing has been keeping it a secret, because weve known for about three-and-a-half weeks. Christopher Nolan  ChristopherNolanis one of the most acclaimed filmmakers of the st century and among the highest grossing directors of all-time. His work on the Dark Knight trilogy as well as movies including The Prestige, Inception and Dunkirk brought him blockbuster success as well as an Oscar nomination. Now, the -year-old can add a CBE to his already illustrious CV after being recognised for services to film in the New Year Honours. In a  interview with ,Nolan, who holds dual UK and US nationality, lamented the lack of support he received in the country of his birth while trying to break through in the film industry, reflecting: But theres a very limited pool of finance in the UK. To be honest, its a very clubby kind of place. In Hollywood theres a great openness, almost a voracious appetite for new people. Michael Palin   The former Monty Python star, who gets a knighthood in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas list for his international contributions to travel, culture and geography, said news of the accolade had not sunk in yet. He said: I dont think it will be until I see the envelopes addressing me as Sir Michael Palin. I have been a knight before, in Python films. I have been several knights including Sir Galahad and the knight who said, ni. He added: I am so very pleased that I was able to sort of morph from being Python and becoming a traveller, or a presenter of travel programmes. That gave me the chance to see an enormous amount of the world. Margaret Atwood  Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood, author of the feminist dystopian work The Handmaids Tale, becomes a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour for services to literature. She is alone this time round in receiving the highest honour it is possible to bestow in the New Year list. Philip Pullman The creator of the hugely successful His Dark Materials trilogy said he was very surprised and honoured to receive a knighthood for services to literature. He added: Im most grateful of all to those who continue to read my books, and I hope they dont have to work as hard as those who edit them. Jim Carter Carter, who played Mr Carson in the hit British period drama Downton Abbey, said he was delighted his OBE for services to drama came in time to be seen by his -year-old mother, who lit up at the good news. He added: Im hoping for a  of good news and kindness. It seems perilous times and it would be good to get a bit of kindness, sanity and good cheer back into the world.

The video has emerged as crowds of supporters have turned out for the annual Boxing Day hunts across the UK. The footage was allegedly filmed in Devon and has caused many to call on the government to strengthen legislation banning hunting with hounds.Devon County Hunt Saboteurs say the footage was captured during the Eggesford Hunt at Place Farm, on the edge of Okehampton, according to DevonLive. A spokesman said: When our sab team arrived the fox was barely alive, with its guts hanging out, and died in the arms of a young female saboteur.  A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: Today we have been made aware of an incident near Okehampton on Boxing Day involving allegations of offences against the Hunting Act. The matter is being investigated and police would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident. We would encourage witnesses to any offences to share unedited footage and images with us, and to be prepared to give statements to allow us to investigate any allegation of criminality. We are aware of the sensitivities and the high-emotions that are linked to these incidents. All allegations connected with hunts are assessed and investigated appropriately and we work with our communities who have an interest in hunt activity as part of routine policing. We wish to reassure the public that we will act impartially and promptly to any incident reported to us, and would urge anyone with relevant information to contact Devon and Cornwall Police via . Ahead of the hunts, shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said an incoming Labour government would review penalties under the Hunting Act  to ensure it is an effective deterrent. It would include a consultation on the introduction of custodial sentences, bringing it in line with the penalties for other wildle crimes.  Ms Hayman said they would also consider measures to prevent the exploitation of loopholes in the legislation, which covers England and Wales. It could include the introduction of a new recklessness clause to prevent trail or drag hunts being used as cover for the illegal hunting of wild mammals. Ms Hayman said they would also look at removing an exemption for the use of dogs underground to protect game birds as it risks fights between hounds and wild animals. Labours  Hunting Act was a key milestone in banning this cruel blood sport, but since then new practices have developed to exploit loopholes in the legislation, she said. While Theresa May proposed scrapping the Hunting Act all together, Labour is today calling time on those who defy the law by announcing several measures that would clampdown on illegal hunting. Labour is the true party of animal welfare. These new proposals form part of the next chapter in striving to ensure our laws and regulations on animal welfare are up to date and fit for purpose. Grove and Rufford Hunt chairman Nick Alexander criticised Labours plans, saying there is more to prioritise in the world than beefing up hunting legislation.  He spoke as the hunt ed to Bawtry, near Doncaster in South Yorkshire, a year after it was refused permission to meet in the centre of the town following the convictions of three people for hunting offences. Of Labours plans he said: Its not welcome. It just seems a bit bizarre that theres lots of other things going on in the world at this time and,thats the priority, then someone needs to have a word. Standing among the crowds, he added: Look at all this. This is the real truth of the matter. Hunting is very much part of England - old England and modern England. And were here to stay.

So I’m not going to sell you a pup. It was bad. Thanks to the shambolic handling of Brexit,  was suffocated by a story that split the nation and made Britain a global laughing stock. But it wasn’t all bad. We had a glorious summer, the royals let a woman of colour into their ranks, North and South Korea agreed to formally end their war, Ireland repealed its abortion ban, England reached a World Cup shysemi-final and Trump didn’t blow up the planet. So here are my awards for ’s great, good and not-so good... Best joke  The Tories sent a campaign letter to an elderly couple, purportedly from Theresa May, addressed to “Mr Youmustbe F***ingjoking”. Banksy made a mockery of arts snobbery by shredding one of his paintings that had just sold for poundmillion. More people voted to put slab-headed footballer Harry Maguire riding a unicorn on a bank note than Margaret Thatcher. Nick Clegg, the man who did more to alienate schoolkids from politics by lying about tuition fees, was made a “sir”. But nothing had us rolling in the aisles more than the two Russian hitmen who poisoned the Skripals, claiming to have been in Salisbury because they were fascinated by the size of its cathedral spire. Best sight There was the auction of Nigel Farage’s National Portrait Gallery painting which failed to attract a single bid. There was Gareth Southgate’s waistcoat in Russia, which proved that mad dogs and Englishmen do go out in the C sun dressed for a wedding. There was the blimp of the US president flown above London during his UK visit which looked like Donald Trump impersonating Elvis Presley when he’d become so obese he couldn’t control his bowels. But on a personal level it has to be the closing credits of the abysmal corn-fest that was Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. Best Trump outburst  When asked to rate his presidential performance, the humble introvert replied: “I give myself an A-plus”. To howls of laughter he told the UN General Assembly that his administration had “accomplished more than almost any in the history of our country”. To much grimacing he told Kim Jong-un that he had a bigger nuclear button than him. But nothing summed up the ignorant racist philistine more than when he asked, during a discussion on visa limits for people from Haiti and Africa: “Why do we want people from all these sh**hole countries here  We should have more people from places like Norway.” Best quote  Tory peer Jeffrey Archer hopefully spoke for the nation when he said: “I’d vote for CorbynI lived in the North because half of what he says I find myself agreeing with %.” Tory MP Johnny Mercer definitely spoke for it when he called Theresa May’s Government a “sh**show”. But taking gold, despite being three years old, was David Cameron’s masterclass in irony before the  election, which was on most of our minds every day of the year: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” How did that pan out  Best man  Those Thai cave rescuers showed magnicent ingenuity when they helped a trapped boys’ football team to safety. Raheem Sterling showed admirable courage, not just for taking on the racists at football grounds, but by kicking off a debate about how the media treats young black men. However, there could only be one winner: Danny Dyer, for calling out, live on TV, the architect of all of our misery, David Cameron: “How comes he can scuttle off  He called all this on. Where is he  Hes in Nice, with his trotters up. Tw*t.” Still makes me proud, that. Best woman  There was a big breakthrough in TV writers making us realise women could pen some of the funniest shows out there: Lisa McGee’s Derry Girls, Julia Davis’s SallyEver, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Killing Eve. Radio presenter Rachael Bland showed us all how to die with humour, dignity and courage when cancer claimed her, aged . But for giving the world a smile in a tough year I can’t look past porn star Stormy Daniels who claimed having sex with Donald Trump was the “least impressive” she’d had, mainly because his penis “has a huge mushroom head like a toadstool”. Worst man  James Dyson told us Brexit would liberate UK industry then announced his new electric car would be built in Singapore. David Davis resigned as Brexit Secretary after barely speaking to counterparts in Europe for two years then signed up for an after-dinner speaking agency. Tony Blair was never off the airwaves telling us about the disaster of Brexit to make us forget all about his disaster in Iraq. But the winner had to be the odious Boris Johnson, who whipped up hate with his burka letterbox jibe and resigned from a disastrous spell as foreign secretary to plot and lie his way to Number . Worst woman  Nadine Dorries told us it was “time for a charismatic figure like Tommy Robinson to be running the country”. Roseanne Barr finished her career when she tweeted that black businesswoman Valerie Jarrett was the product of a sex act between “Muslim brotherhood  planet of the apes”. And Jo Marney, the girlfriend of ex-UKIP leader Henry Bolton, spewed out Katie Hopkins-style tweets. But the winner is the most disloyal Labour MP in living memory. The one who has made a career being elected by working-class Labour voters of Vauxhall to represent shire voters who like hunting, DUP supporters and the Jacob Rees-Mogg tendency of the Tory Party: Kate Hoey.

The two lts in Winterstoke House, Ashton Gate, Bristol - which shares an estate with two other high rises - have been out of order since Christmas Eve. There are  flats within the building, which houses people over  years old, many of whom have health complaint, according to Lyn and Stephen Phillips, who live on the th floor. One of the lts was reported broken to Bristol City Council earlier this month and residents have been told that engineers were waiting on a part, Bristol Live reports. But then around pm on Christmas Eve the second lt in the building broke down - leaving the dozens of residents who live there without any lt at all. Have you had a Christmas nightmare  Email webnews@mirror  Bristol City Council has said engineers were sent out the same day to fix the lt but they have been unable to keep the lt operational. The council has also apologised to residents who have been inconvenienced as a result of the broken lts and said getting at least one lt working was a “top priority”. But this has done little to appease those residents who face up to  flights of stairsthey want to leave their own home. Lyn and Steve say they have been “trapped” since Christmas Eve. Lyn, who is -years-old and suffers from angina, said her Christmas has been “ruined” as result. She said that the pair ended up eating a cheese sandwich for their Christmas dinner as they were unable to leave the building and travel to their daughter’s house where they were supposed to spend the day. “I have already had a heart attack and am currently trying to fight off a chest infection with antibiotics, so there is no way I could climb  flights of stairs,” added Lyn, whose husband Steve is an insulin dependant diabetic. “Christmas was completely ruined for us.  “We have become prisoners in our own home. It’s absolutely disgusting.” The pair, who have lived in Winterstoke House for four years, said engineers had been visiting the building on and off since Monday trying to fix the lt. “Occasionally they would get it working again but then it would break again a couple of hours later,” she added. “I don’t want to leave the building and then not be able to get back into my home - or even worse get stuck in the lt when it breaks down.” But the pair said it was not just themselves they were worried about, but the other residents who live in the building who they say are a lot worse off than them. “We have people in their nineties living here, people with mobility issues who rely on the lts to get in and out of the building,” added Lyn. Debra Sainsbury said she is worried about her -year-old mother Maureen who lives on the fth floor of the building.  “Some of the people living in these flats are vulnerable older people so this whole experience has been really horrible for them,” she added. “My mum has had to tackle five flights of stairs in order to get out of the building.” Ms Sainsbury has also said she is worried about emergency services being able to access the building. Winterstoke House has a buzzer system which allows residents to buzz in any visitors from their own flat. Once buzzed into the building visitors have access to the lts, but in order to access the stairs they need a key fob to open another door. This means that residents have to walk down the stairs to the bottom floor in order to let any visitors into the building - this includes emergency services. Bristol City Council has said that the fire service has special key fobs that allow them access to council buildings, therefore they would not have an issue entering Winterstoke House. But other emergency services would need to have the door opened by the caretaker or a resident to get access to the stairs while the lts are broken. “It’s just really worrying to think about what would happenmum, or any of the other residents, had an accident in their flat and couldn’t get down the stairs to let the ambulance service in,” added Ms Sainsbury. Signs have been put up in the building informing residents of the issues with the lts by the lt company Stannah.  A typed note on one of the lts says: “Dear tenant, due to the non availability of a replacement lt motor drive unit for lt number one, we have had to remove the existing unit to vendors for repair. “Unfortunately due to the holiday period we cannot be guaranteed a deliverydate. “We will refit the repaired unit as soon as it is available. “Stannah apologise for any inconvenience this may cause anyone.” But now a handwritten note has been added to the bottom of the signs which says: “Apologies both lts are now out of order awaiting parts. Please contact the council for updates. “Sincerest apologies for the inconvenience.” In a statement on Wednesday, Bristol City Council said the contractors had been back on site, and it was hoped that one lt would be up and running by the end of yesterday. A spokesperson added: “We apologise to residents of Winterstoke House for any inconvenience caused by the broken lts – especially at this time of year when friends and family may be visiting. “The fault on the second lt was reported to us at around pm on Christmas Eve. “An engineer attended the same day, and was able to get the lt operational, but unfortunately it then broke down again. “The other lt has been out of action for ten days, and we are currently waiting for a part to be refurbished. We hope this will be done in early January. “However, making sure at least one lt is working has been a top priority for us. Caretaking staff are also on site to help vulnerable residents throughout the day.” "},{"url":null,"title":"familys car torched christmas day","story":"NewsFamilys car torched on Christmas Day after thugs threaten to burn them aliveJamil Akhtar, his we and three children were asleep in their home in Sparkhill, Birmingham, when two thugs set their car ablazeShareCommentsByElaine McCahillNews Reporter:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video familys-car-torched-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA family were left fearing for their lives after their car was set ablaze on Christmas Day.

The music giant could not compete with online retailers. The dip in consumer confidence, fears over Brexit and squeezed household budgets also played a part in its demise. But firms such as HMV must compete with one hand tied behind their back, as online companies make billions in sales but pay barely any corporation tax or business rates. It makes a mockery of the taxation system that HMV, with sales of poundmillion, paid poundmillion in business rates last year, while Amazon, with pound.billion sales, paid poundmillion.

The post titled Seriously did Grover just drop the Fbomb   has over , upvotes on the forum, with many claiming they can hear whichever one they have in mind at that moment. Several pointed out that Grover cant possibly be swearing, as its a childrens television programme so it simply wouldnt be allowed.  The video has confused thousands of online viewers, with Youtuber Evan Edinger writing on Twitter: I can hear both depending on which one Im thinking in my head! Many commented on the ambiguous clip with their opinion on the matter, with some even claiming that this could be the next Yanni or Laurel soundbite.  In the case of Yanny or Laurel, the reason for people being able to hear only one of the two names was said to be down to the frequency sensitivity of the iniduals ears. For example, older people who lack high frequency sensitivity are more likely to hear Yanny, while younger ears are more likely to hear Laurel.

The Madagascar pochard duck rapidly declined in population to the point of near extinction due to human impact in their African homeland. But now,  of the ducks have spent a week in the safety of the worlds first floating aviaries on Lake Sofia in the north of the country.Gloucestershire-based Wildfowl and Wetlands Trustsaid this pioneering approach is to enable the birds to become accustomed to their new surroundings, increasing the chances they will remain at the site after release.  The state of the wetlands in Madagascar is so poor they will likely not survivethey leave the lake. The ducks were released from the aviaries in December and very quickly adapted to the lake, ing and flying, associating with other wild ducks and ing to the safety of the floating aviaries to feed and roost. Experts from WWT, Durrell Wildle Conservation Trust, The Peregrine Fund and the Government of Madagascar have spent years laying the foundations for the birds introduction.  With a wild population of just , the duck may be the rarest bird on the planet. Nigel Jarrett, head of conservation breeding at the WWT, said: It takes a village to raise a child, so the old African proverb goes, but in this case it has taken a village to raise a duck. We have been preparing for this moment for over a decade. The logistics of working in a remote part of Madagascar - where access to the lakes by vehicle is only possible for three months a year - have been an enormous challenge, requiring us to come up with novel approaches. Working with local communities to solve the issues which were driving this bird to extinction has been essential to giving the pochard a chance of survival."},{"url":null,"title":"man nicknamed alien due enlarged","story":"NewsMan nicknamed \"ALIEN\" due to enlarged head wants surgery so he can fall in loveDue to his mystery condition Anshu Kumar has deep set and narrow eyes in his head and the -year-is unable to grow more than a thin strip of hair on top of his headShareCommentsByDavid AspinallKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video man-cruelly-nicknamed-alien-because-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA labourer who wants to fall in love and get married is desperate for surgery as he thinks his large head is putting women off.

State-run broadcaster RT sent the chocolate gts to members of the media and others claiming it reflected one of the biggest news stories of the year. Politicians in the city, where ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with Novichok in March, are said to be furious about the disrespectful gt. Salisbury MP John Glen said: This is bizarre behaviour but to be expected. A picture of the chocolate cathedral circulated online after Russian channel TV Dozhd, also known as TV rain, posted a picture of the edible gt on Twitter.  They thanked RT for the gt but said: Come for tea, were afraid to eat it alone. Salisbury councillor Jo Broom said the gt was in very poor taste. Its very regrettable that somebody would see fit to do something like this, and is quite disrespectful to those that were caught up in the incident. RT interviewed the two men believed to be responsible for poisoning the Skripals, named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.  The men said they were tourists visiting the famous Salisbury Cathedral at the time of the near-fatal attack. They said friends had advised them to visit the monument and its m-tall spire but they decided not to ass there was muddy slush everywhere. Dawn Sturgess died in July after being exposed to Novichok when her boyfriend Charlie Rowley discovered a perfume bottle filled with the noxious substance.  An RT spokesperson said the chocolate model had been sent as a gt in the spirit of the Holiday Season to multiple friends, peers and partners in the media sphere and beyond.

They’ll be huge for us.”To add to the Dark Blues’ woes, St Mirren picked up a victory at Motherwell to leave them three points adrt at the foot of the ision.Adding points to his own team’s total is more important to Jim, however – as is bringing in new faces next month.“What St Mirren do isn’t our concern,” Jim added.“It’s all about what we do and we have to make sure we continue to just think about ourselves.“The transfer window is going to be important for all of the clubs at the bottom, it’s an opportunity to try to get players in to help the ones we already have.”The Dark Blues did hold out against a dominant Celtic for almost the entire first half with his team’s organisation pleasing the manager, though the manner of the opening goal didn’t.He said: “It was a deserved scoreline.“Celtic were very good, their movement was so fluid, they caused us loads of problems.“I thought our organisation defensively was very good for  minutes but concentration levels are so important.“The timing of the goal and our player stopping for offside was the key disappointment.“It was onside, our video boy confirmed at half-time it was onside, so that was disappointing, just play to the whistle and argue about it later.“A couple of minutes before half-time you’re looking to get in at - and regroup, try to address where Celtic were hurting us.“In the second half Celtic were just too good for us, simple as that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blether dundee and dundee united played many times in forfarshire cup","story":"The subject of senior regional cups prompted Joe Millar to phone.Joe, a retired bus driver from Dundee, said: “I saw Dundee and Dundee United play many times in the Forfarshire Cup.“I also know there was a Fe Cup and a Glasgow Cup.“Were there any other regional cups for senior teams to play in ”Going by the name, I think most regions were covered by their own particular trophy.Others I can remember were Aberdeenshire Cup, Ayrshire Cup, East of Scotland Shield, Lanarkshire Cup, Renfrewshire Cup and Stirlingshire Cup."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b618c27eebe2-873x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united fans bid to raise funds for statue of legend jim mclean","story":"The Dundee United Community Trust and Jim McLean Tribute Group have joined forces in a bid to raise funds to build a statue of the legendary manager.The groups handed out flyers at Saturday’s match with Falkirk as they look to pull together the necessary money for the design and production of a statue at Tannadice.A range of fundraising activities is set to be held in a bid to raise the cash required to pay a fitting tribute to the former boss.A Just Giving page has been set up for fans to donate, with the groups also planning to reach out to benefactors within the club and beyond.David Dorward, chairman of Dundee United Community Trust, said: “Dundee United Community Trust is delighted to support this project.”George Haggarty, chairman of the Jim McLean Tribute Group, added: “This is a great project.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c1cc286b0142-458x564.jpg ","title":"takeover talk was none of our business says dundee united defender","story":"Defender Callum Booth says the Dundee United takeover and the speculation in the run-up to it was never a big topic of conversation in the dressing-room.And the full-back admits there was much more gossip in the squad after Csaba Laszlo’s departure at the end of December.However, he concedes what new American owner Mark Ogren does once the transfer window opens next week will be grabbing the attention of him and his team-mates.“I would say we were more focused on the speculation surrounding the club when we didn’t have a manager,” said the -year-old former Partick Thistle man.“Then that was what all the players were talking about. It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"toy-bank-in-govan-helps-hundreds-of-families-on-christmas-day-thanks-to-evening-times","story":"HUNDREDS of struggling families had presents to open on Christmas Day thanks to an annual toy appeal which received generous donations from Evening Times readers."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen-manager-derek-mcinnes-brands-craig-levein-childish","story":"Derek McInnes has labelled Craig Levein \"childish\" after the Hearts boss went on a fresh rant directed at the Dons manager.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

For myself, it has two principal components.The first is light. Most societies had and have a celebration of light at the darkest time of the year. It is a pattern followed by most of the world#s great religions.The religious reference is not only to the physical darkness of the sun being below the equator, but also the psychological darkness caused by uncertainty, loss, suffering of the body or the mind, broken relationships and the brokenness of many lives.By allowing the light of Christ to shine into our lives and bring comfort, guidance, courage, strength, we can change direction, start again and have cause for celebration.The second aspect is of birth. It really does not matter where or when Jesus was born. As Paul writes: #Jesus was born of a woman#, as we all were. The birth of a child, the gt of le, with all the potential each child has to become fully themselves.Jesus#s birth was no more or no less important to Mary and toThis time of year gives us the opportunity to celebrate le and perhaps, as the years pass and we look back, to reflect on how we have used our gts and talents.Is the world a better place because I we have walked this way  Is the world a better place because the Christ has walked this way If you are together as family, be happy together. Le is too valuable to spoil a celebration. If you are alone, I trust there are folk around you who will share with you.Whoever you are, may the light and the love of Christ#s coming bless you as you journey.PIC:Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell. _aRevCampbellAs isional commander, I sincerely hope this very special time of year is one that is fun-filled, enjoyed by all, and everyone is kept safe.It’s also a time for reflection.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste.

Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

In recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month. And residents at Girvan Community Council raised questions over the lack of CCTV along Dalrymple Street. Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks. Cllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the Girvan community. He said: “It is fantastic - I think it has highlighted the fact that when we had the incidents of vandalism, how important CCTV is for protecting our town centres. “I’m glad that the ones we have are ing, but more to the point - I am really delighted that the new CCTV is on the way. “I think it is a win-win situation for the community of Girvan.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"school becomes single campus two","story":"NewsSchool becomes single campus as two main parts join upThe transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House.ShareByStephen Houston:,  DEC NewsWellington school is now a single campus \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe two main parts of Wellington School have become one. The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single

part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had

of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can.

I keep hearing of people having to go private because they canrsquot get elective surgery ndash thatrsquos hips and knees ndash without waiting in agony for a year. Therersquos been a crisis of recruitment, with GPs retiring early and medical staff ing to Europe because of Brexit. Health boards are going bust and Audit Scotland pronounced the Scottish NHS ldquofinancially unsustainable in October.The merger of social care and healthcare has not generated the economies of scale and integration many hoped for. Scotland will share in the extra pound billion for the NHS announced in the UK Budget ndash but that doesnrsquot really amount to much in a service that still uses fax machines and pagers.The Trussell Trust says that use of foodbanks has risen by more than % thanks largely to the new benefit system. Yet the Government has placed badly-needed reforms on hold as part of its no-deal Brexit planning. The Scottish Government has just taken on greater responsibility for welfare and is under intense pressure from charities to mitigate the impact of Universal Credit.Obsessed with Brexit, we all but forgot that there is a war going on in Europe: in the Donbass region of Ukraine. The Ukraine government recently imposed martial law prior to an expected crackdown on pro-Russian separatists.Meanwhile, Putin has placed hundreds of battle tanks on the border. Nato is reportedly supplying arms to the pro-Western Poroshenko government in Kiev, so any Russian invasion could ignite the most serious conflict in Europe since the Second World War.Then, out of the blue, Donald Trump pulls US troops out of Syria and we suddenly remember that wersquove given hardly a thought all year to whatrsquos been happening in the Middle East and the war against Isis. It is now recognised that allied bombing of Raqqa was just as deadly to civilians as the widely-condemned Russian bombing of Aleppo. Amnesty International says the British and US strikes may have amounted to war crimes.Donald Trump continued his trade wars in . Were it not for the Brexit blinkers wersquod probably be preparing to deal with the next economic recession, which many economists seem convinced is coming. There is now a deadly combination of Trump wars, overcapacity, and public and private debt weighing down the global economy. You may not have noticed but one of the biggest stock-market booms in history has just come to a crashing end.The focus is on the beef between China and America, but the situation in the European Union is not reassuring. There was a potentially disastrous standoff between the Italian populist government of deputy Matteo Salvini and the EU this month, which echoed the Greek crisis of . A sovereign debt crisis looms as Italian debt rises beyond % of GDP. Central banks have little in their armoury left to deal with another recession, after a full decade of zero interest rates and quantitative easing.The internet has destroyed most of the high street, the newspaper industry, terrestrial broadcasting and is now eating itself, with Google and Facebook mired in scandals over surveillance capitalism. The tech giants finally lost their progressive gloss in .Demands for greater regulation grew ever louder following revelations about Cambridge Analyticarsquos targeted advertising during the Brexit referendum. Much of this algorithmic activity was allegedly financed by ldquodark money from right-wing plutocrats. rsquos intrepid tech reporter, Carole Cadwalladr, claimed collusion between Brexiters and the Kremlin trying to destabilise our politics.However, it emerged this month that British intelligence spooks have been conducting their own psyops programme through a company registered in, of all places, Auchtermuchty. The Integrity Initiative has reportedly been enlisting journalists to help conduct a retaliatory social media campaign against the Kremlin. This seems to have mainly involved smearing Jeremy Corbyn and his communications director, Seumus Milne, as Kremlin shills. I can confirm that the Integrity Initiative hasnt approached me ndash yet.Meanwhile, China is becoming a huge player in the ldquocognitive-military complex as the new hybrid warfare is being called. The Communist state stands accused of all manner of digital jiggery-pokery, online warfare and industrial espionage. The FBI warned this month that the cybersecurity threat from China ndash spying, hacking and so forth ndash is worse than anything Putinrsquos Fancy Bears have been up to. The Chinese tech giant Huawei has been banned from selling its G mobile phone equipment to America, Canada and New Zealand because it is feared there could be security issues.A Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested by the Canadian government this month, provoking number of retaliatory detentions of Canadians by the Chinese.Huawei is now the biggest telecoms equipment company in the world and works hand-in-glove with the Communist regime, including on its seriously scary social engineering programmes: Social Credit. This assigns a digital trust score to every one of Chinarsquos . billion citizens, based on their behaviour under constant video surveillance. It is an algorithmic dictatorship, a true digital dystopia, straight out of Black Mirror.Therersquos no sign of the government wishing to emulate this here, though there have been some worrying developments, such as the proposals to make misogyny and other forms of behaviour illegal under hate crime laws.The police are now recording as ldquohate incidents jokes, abusive remarks and accusations of transphobia. It may not be long before our digital devices like Alexa are checking on whether or not we use hate speech in our homes ndash theyrsquore already said to be eavesdropping on us for commercial purposesAnd Scotland  Well, perhaps the greatest casualty of Brexit has been Scottish politics, which practically ground to a halt in . The Scottish Parliamentrsquos powers have been undermined by two Supreme Court rulings relating to Brexit.The Sewel Convention is no more, and the Scottish Government has been put firmly in its place over its Continuity Bill, which tried to oppose the ldquopower grab of responsibilities repatriated from Brussels. Westminster remains sovereign over all matters, and possesses ldquounqualied legislative power, as the Law Lords ruled.No-one is even talking of a Scottish independence referendum any more, since it would simply be rejected by the UK Government. Scotland is being dragged kicking and screaming out of the European Union, and there seems nothing Nicola Sturgeon can do about it.At least, not until the Brexit clusterburach is finally resolved."},{"url":null,"title":"a-year-of-column-debate-je-regrette-almost-rien","story":"Writing a column, to paraphrase the football pundits, is all about opinion. What the year has underlined is you are entitled to have one ndash so long as it agrees with the opinion of the reader.Poor me  Not a bit of it. The columnist, in making the point, is aware of using the lighter fluid of hyperbole to spark up the flames of debate. And sometimes the columnist uses the lighter fluid inadvisedly.That was most likely the case with the column about Zoe Ballrsquos pre-determined take-over of the Chris Evans Show on Radio . I argued that it was undemocratic that not a man in the land was considered for the job. The likes of my chum Elaine C. Smith argued back this didnrsquot matter. ldquoWersquove suffered from hundreds of years of patriarchy, so why shouldnrsquot women get their chance  Women In Journalism described me as a ldquomisogynistic dinosaur and Nicola Sturgeon said I was ldquooutdated and ldquoawful. Do I regret writing this piece  No. I still believe to deny men equal opportunity goes against the grain of democracy. I would still argue for as much training encouragement women need in order for them to compete in whichever work arena they choose to enter. Womenrsquos choices canrsquot ever be constrained. But men shouldnrsquot be excluded from the process.The comment however did make me ask whether I could ever support positive discrimination. The answer is lsquoYes.rsquo If two young people, for example, applied to Oxbridge, and both had the same qualications and one were working class and the other Eton-grown, Irsquod give the entry to the working class person. If the working class person were male and the other a female from Cheltenham Ladiesrsquo College again Irsquod choose on the basis of class.In a conversation last week with Jackie Bird and the issue of BBC positive discrimination strategy the news presenter said she believed in meritocracy. This was warming. This is coming from the daughter of a school janitor from Hamilton.As for the lighter fluid intro on the Zoe Ball column  Yes, Regrets on that one. ldquoTime to give Zoe Ball a little kicking wasnrsquot the best choice of metaphor. It set the tone for war.The column about race discrimination in theatre also caused a little conflict. I had found it hard to accept black actors being placed in historical white roles ndash because of anachronisms. Some actors of colour agreed with the comment. Some pointed out that grant money is often a spur to casting. But it all led to a fascinating discussion with actor Grant OrsquoRourke who argued ends-justied- means and theatre is about endless possibility, a non-prescriptive world in which a table can easily become a sailing ship. ldquoSo why canrsquot a s Hooray Henry be black  We couldnrsquot agree. But the  head will try to see past the colour of those playing our Stanley Kowalskis.The other column which saw social media go into meltdown came about after criticism of Gaelic funding. And the result was a meeting with Professor Wilson McLeod and we discussed Gaelic history, passions, and the social implications of keeping the language alive. Am I now studying Gaelic  Not at all. But I can recognise many of the reasons why the Gaelic voice is so passionate.But I know yoursquore looking for at least one act of contrition. Here it is. In the column Stressed: Stop Feeling Sorry for Yourself, I separated stress from depression. I argued they were dferent things. This was wrong. Wersquove so much more to cope with these days. We see the world so readily we canrsquot deny its confusions and disasters. We face a whole new range of problems, from the likes of technology, gender issues, paying the gas bill. My revised thinking  Depression is the next stop on the line after Stress.There are no regrets however about dissing Burns Suppers, Michelle Mone, Theresa Mayrsquos lack of empathy, Jeremy Corbynrsquos lack of cojones and Nicola Sturgeonrsquos obfuscations. And Madonna. There are no regrets about questioning rapper Kendrick Lamarrsquos being awarded this yearrsquos Pulitzer Prize for Music. I liked Darren McGarveyrsquos response to the column however in which he said in a video message running at : it was ldquoF****** s*** journalism and added ldquoThat you can have that idea that a hip hop artist canrsquot elevate a form to a high art is ludicrous. I didnrsquot say that, Darren. I said I didnrsquot see the merit in Lamarrsquos lyrics. Not the same thing, but more power to your larynx.I canrsquot say the same about my Auntie Ethel. After I wrote about MS losing the way and poorly-stitched underpants she rounded on me and pointed out the many merits of the store chain. As I head there right now to buy dinner I reckon she may have a point.So yoursquore right.

We hope the audience have as much fun watching it as we did making it.\"Gilbert added: \"Itrsquos nice to be involved again all these years later.\"Itrsquos a sketch that has a real place in the hearts of Scotland and was such a fixture of Hogmanay.ldquoInevitably, people will compare what Gregorrsquos doing to what Rikki did, but itrsquos not about that.\"Gregor is not doing an impersonation, itrsquos more of an emulation.\"Hogmanay Live is broadcast on December , at .pm on BBC One Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"castle-survives-to-become-the-most-photographed-in-the-highlands","story":"It is the most photographed castle in Scotland, and has been featured in blockbuster films from Highlander to James Bond. If you walk into any Scottish gt shops, yoursquore as likely to see Eilean Donan castle as tartan or shortbread.But for many years the castle did not look as it does now.  marks  years since the fateful battle which left the castle in ruins after destruction by the British during the Jacobite rising. years later work began on restoring Eilean Donan to its former glory by John MacRae-Gilstrap of Clan MacRae.Sitting between the three sea lochs of Loch Long, Loch Alsh, and Loch Duich, the caste has was used as a stronghold by Spanish invaders during the uprising in a bid to restore James Stuart, son of James IV of Scotland, to the throne.The castle was under heavy bombardment from British naval ships, for several days and eventually, after barrels of gunpowder were set alight, the Eilean Donan was demolished and would not be lived in for over  years.Dr Iain MacInnes is an expert in medieval Scotland from the University of the Highlands and Islands. He spoke about how the castle has had a long history of importance to Scotland:ldquoIt is perhaps its location that makes it ldquospecial, on the road to Skye, and regularly voted as one of Scotlandrsquos most picturesque castles. There is little doubting its ldquoromantic location and its general setting.ldquoThe fact that a castle appears to have existed in some form on this site from the very early middle ages suggests that it was situated at an important strategic location.ldquoIts access to the sea meant that it would likely have acted not just as a castle, but also as a harbour for ships connected to the ruling families in the area, from which they could project their sea power over the region.ldquoThis was an important part of lordship in this region, where travel by water was probably more important than travel by land. Its likely th-century origins also relate to providing defence in depth against Scandinavian raids and incursions in a period when Scoto-Norse relations were not good.Dr MacInnes also says that as with many of Scotlandrsquos Castles, Robert the Bruce may have paid a visit as part of his conquest of Scotland:ldquoClan history suggests that Robert the Bruce stayed at Eilean Donan in - on his flight westwards following his defeat at the battle of Methven, he said.ldquoThere is no corroborative evidence for this, however, and the temptation to be associated with the ldquowarrior king is quite a strong one in many clan histories, so this might well come under the heading of ldquomyth.ldquoAnd, as with many Scottish castles, there is the ghost of a mysterious lady also associated with it. Scottish folklore has a lot to answer for. There is even a suggestion of a Mathesonbeing able to speak to birds. Make of that what you will.ldquoIts lsquolast hurrahrsquo in the Jacobite uprising of  is a pretty spectacular way to go out!Between  and , work began on the rebuilding Eilean Donan by Lt. Col. John MacRae-Gilstrap. As well as a footbridge to connect the island to the mainland, it was built up again to stand just as it had done for hundreds of years before its destruction.Now, visitors from all over Scotland and the world come to visit it, take pictures and even marry there, cementing its status as a Scottish cultural icon for years to come.Clan Mackenzie, along with Clan Macrae have a special affinity with the castle, as it was the stronghold of the Clan for many years. A Committee member of the Clan Mackenzie Society spoke about the long history with the iconic fortress:ldquoIt seems reasonably clear that the Mackenzies then lost control of Eilean Donan at some point by the first half of the century, they said.ldquoThen, following a long exile on the part of the chief, Murdoch Dubh, he finally seems likely to have recovered the familyrsquos power base in Kintail in a purported Royal Charter of  - which was purported to have been further confirmed in  to his son in a grant from the Exchequer.ldquoBecause of the Mackenziersquos power-base in this region it was chosen as the landing place for the Jacobite invasion which was aided by Spanish troops but defeated in the Glen near the Castle by the English General Wightman.ldquoThe Mackenzie, chief, William Dubh , the th Earl and nd Jacobite Marquis off Seaforth, played a heroic role in this Rising before being wounded and carried across the mountainsto exile and safety.ldquoThe MacRaes also played an important role in the history of the Castle, since they are a local clan who were the traditional bodyguards of the Mackenzie chief and their own chiefs had been the hereditary constables of Eilean Donan and were consequently dubbed lsquoMackenziersquos Shirt-of-Mailrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"the-iconic-the-heroic-and-the-unforgettable-those-we-lost-in-2018","story":"The music industry lost one of its greatest this year: the Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin.

When he started to receive anonymous letters warning of murders to come he went to the police station, only to be snubbed by the new young inspector in charge, Crome . When he finally did secure a meeting, Crome mocked him. ldquoMr Pure-oh, he said, making no attempt made to pronounce his name correctly, ldquoyou appear to be melting. Poirot wiped a drip of hair dye from his face. You could almost feel millions of viewers wincing on his behalf.The murdererrsquos MO was going through the ABC railway guide of British stations, killing someone in each town. Sadly, none of the towns were in Scotland. Had the murderer ventured north the ways of ScotRail would soon have stopped him in his tracks. Edinburgh, but bus replacement service from Croy put the kibosh on that.The England of  was portrayed as a grubby place where foreigners were not welcome. One could see why some have chosen to see an anti-Brexit message here, but this was indeed the era that saw the rise of the British Union of Fascists. Alas, that was no invention.Malkovich was quietly magnicent as Poirot, Shirley Henderson was her usual impressive self as the sleazy landlady pimping out her daughter, and Rupert Grint, showed once again that there is so much more to him than Ron Weasley. Bizarrely, the only flaw was the murder part of the tale, which seemed far-fetched, almost an afterthought.Being the true story of a couple of nice, unassuming sorts who became Olympic ice dance champions, Torvill and Deandid not promise much in the way of drama, but it turned out to be one of the highlights of the week. We found out such a lot about the couple, including whether they ever were ldquoa couple, that it was like encountering them for the first time.The director was Scotlandrsquos Gillies MacKinnon , with William Ivory on writing duties and Poppy Lee Friar and Will Tudor as Chris and Jayne. Both were spot on, though she looked nothing like Jayne. The film ended with, what , footage of the real TD dancing Bolero. It was always amazing, and became even more so after finding out more about the couple who created it.

Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage

advertised for public consultation on November  with a plan showing that the majority of streets in the town will have a mph speed restriction enforced which formerly had only been used near schools.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe new mph proposal covers most of Wick. This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy. With many parked cars on the streets there is always a chance of children walking out between them and not being seen. Slower cars will cut the chances of any potential accident.The civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, Wick and East Caithness, said research had shown a big reduction in collisions in built-up areas in towns and villages following the introduction of mph zones. They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Saturday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

That would be outrageous and, as the Committee has heard, fundamentally undermine efforts to target support where it is most needed.“Orkney has the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty at present.

She said: “Year of Young People has given Scotland an opportunity to build young people’s reputation, and provide more opportunities for them to influence and take action. “I am very proud that I have been one of the ambassadors for my area, and being involved in helping young people shine in my local community.“A few highlights are: Stromness Drama Club winning the National Youth Festival Estrella, on their amazing Young Enterprise Venture which won three awards at the Young Enterprise Finals and their Managing Director, who has been announced as Young Entrepreneur of the Year!“One group which I am part of, the West Mainland Youth Achievement Group, had success this year competing in the MoneyforLe scheme. We went to London to represent Scotland at a National level and won with our project called ‘Trash to Cash’.“During my time as ambassador, I have had the privilege to meet and work with so many people from all walks of le. Without this opportunity, I don’t think I would feel as confident as I do now when taking on new challenges.“I would like to think that stereotypes of young people in Orkney were not too bad, but this year has highlighted how much good can come from the community working together. I would like to see this continue long after YOYP  has finished.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Waiting for a train there has been grim.I also said you could in theory nip out to nearby shops for food or something to read, but that relies on knowing where to go, not having heavy luggage, having enough time before your train, and it not pouring with rain.It is for Network Rail to make good its sins on that score and complete the remodelling of the station in a way that not only meets but surpasses expectations - which will have rightly built up by then.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete.

He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired.

However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

I am absolutely delighted as I feel strongly about honouring Ruby’s name and keeping her memory alive.I also took part in the NI Childrens Hospice K Jingle all the way run on Sunday, December , so with the party and the run, I have raised a total of pound,.Lisa has also launched a blogging website called Chasing Ladybirds. The blog is now live and can be assessed by logging on to www.chasingladybirds.The blog provides Lisa with an outlet to share her own journey, Rubys le and in turn provide support for other families going through similar experiences.A face book page called Ruby Powells Journey and an instagram page ChasingLadybirds was the prelude to this, giving family and friends the opportunity to be updated throughout Rubys treatments and milestones.Lisa explained: Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast residents face fourweek wait for bin collection council blames staffing levels","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What a way to discourage recycling,” one resident wrote.“People will either burn excess paper and cardthey have space to do so or bung it all in black bins or black bin bags for general waste.”In a statement, Belfast City Council said the disruption was due to staffing levels and apologised for any inconvenience.“Due to staffing levels, it has not been possible to provide an alternative collection for blue recycling bins over the Christmas and New Year period,” said a council spokeswoman.“This information was communicated to residents last week as widely as possible, via council’s website and social media channels.“We apologise for the inconvenience. Where possible, we would encourage residents to bring any recyclable materials to their local recycling centre and keep an eye on our website www.belfastcity.gov.uk holidayarrangements and social media for the most up to date information.“We would ask residents who have a scheduled black brown bin collection this weekend and their bin does not get emptied on the day, to please continue to leave it out and we will collect it as soon as possible in the coming days.”In the days leading up to Christmas, a confidential memo by a senior council official was leaked, stating that bin collections could be disrupted due to a pay dispute with staff and trade unions.Nigel Grimshaw, City Hall’s strategic director of city and neighbourhood services, said that staff would be paid time and a half for working on a Saturday , and double time on Sunday .\"However, trade unions and some staff have asked for more money to work on the above days,” he added.\"Their proposal would in effect equate to triple time.\"\"To accept this proposal without proper consideration would likely cause a precedent and would mean applying the same arrangements to other service areas that are provided over this period.\"This could cost the council up to £k additional payroll costs and would have to come out of council reserves as there is no budget for their proposal.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What I suspect is that it’s a completely cynical manoeuvre to run down the clock and offer MPs the choice of the devil or the deep blue sea.”A Downing Street source labelled Mr Corbyn’s call a “silly demand”, and said: “Following debate in the Commons, in the week commencing January  MPs will vote on the Brexit deal.“Instead of making silly demands, Jeremy Corbyn should be honest with voters that he has no alternative plan, and only intends to frustrate Brexit — ultimately betraying the referendum result.”Elsewhere, shadow chancellor John McDonnell dismissed the idea of an indicative vote to find which Brexit options MPs would be prepared to supportthe Prime Minister’s deal is rejected.The shadow chancellor told the Financial Times such a move would “run the clock down even further towards March ”, when Britain is due to leave the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland new year honours 2019","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture Northern Ireland Office official Peter Smyth explained: \"The privilege of being allowed to install such gates is apparently not extended to the Roman Catholic community and has caused considerable resentment in the area.\"Old allegations of Royal Ulster Constabulary collusion with the unionist community are reviving.\"Roslea is a village close to the border, around  miles to the south-east of Enniskillen.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park. The closing date for applications is the end of next month.Since the s, the forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, a long line of passionate gardeners who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important  hectare arboretum.The pound, Heritage Lottery Fundgrant will be used to help fund the development phase of the project, which will work to achieve a vision for Castlewellan Historic Demesne to create a heritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.The development phase includes surveys of the woody plants in the arboretum and bioersity of the park, alongside design work to repair and develop the buildings in The Grange and walled garden. Work is also required to carry out further consultations and submit planning applications.Council chairman Mark Murnin, thanked the HLF for its financial support for the exciting project.ldquoThe park is such a vital part of the local community, he said. I am delighted that this funding gives us the potential for its restoration and that future generations will also be able to enjoy the facility and engage with its heritage, he added.The local authority is keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the Walled Garden area designed to provide access via lt to its upper floor, with the local council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.Politicians were told last week that architects have been awarded the tender for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard and Rhododendron Wood areas, with work underway on planning and statutory approvals for works in the Walled Garden and Bothy Yard.It has also been confirmed that a topographical survey mdash which could cost as much as pound, mdashwill be required to assist with the planning process.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood.A critical look has also been taken of the parkrsquos traffic management and parking facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£700k environment scheme set to begin  ","story":"WORK on a near pound, environmental improvement scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick starts on January .The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the initiative which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the scheme to facilitate the contractor.The government department is making a pound, contribution to the public realm project, with the local authority providing the remainder of the cash for the eagerly-awaited revamp.Design proposals have revealed the work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year.The government department said funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.Local council officials are delighted to be working in partnership with the Department for Communities to deliver the project and are looking forward to the benefits that it will bring to Irish Street in terms of regenerating a central part of the town which has missed out on major public sector investment for several decades.Damian Mulholland mdash director of regional development with the Department for Communities mdash said recently that funding for the streetscape scheme will build on the ldquosignicant public realm investment already made by the government department in Downpatrick over recent years.He said the latest investment for Irish Street will enhance the natural heritage of the area at this historic part of the town and help improve visitors and resident experience.Councillor Dermot Curran says he is pleased work will start early in the New Year and has appealed to motorists to be patient during the lane closure.ldquoI realise this will inevitably have an impact on traffic, but hope roads officials will alter the sequencing of town centre traffic lights in a bid to minimise this, he continued. ldquoI hope the lane closure will be in place for the shortest time possible and will be liaising with contractors throughout the duration of the scheme.Cllr Curran said the scheme will help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents and help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment.He continued: ldquoBusiness owners in particular will be delighted that work is due to start soon. As I have said previously, Irish Street is ripe for redevelopment opportunities and this major investment is long overdue.Cllr Curran is also hopeful that Newry, Mourne and Down Council will make a fresh bid for Heritage Lottery Funding to help restore historic buildings within Downpatrickrsquos conservation area, which includes Irish Street.Several weeks ago it was confirmed that the local authorityrsquos initial bid for a so-called townscape initiative had been rejected, despite a signicant amount of time, effort and money being invested in the application process.Officials in charge of the heritage fund claimed the local authorityrsquos bid was influenced by planned regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area ldquorather than heritage need.In addition, they argued there was limited scope within Downpatrickrsquos townscape initiative area to deliver a ldquocomprehensive scheme and believed that given development proposals for Irish Street and the townrsquos former police base, the local authorityrsquos proposed scheme was ldquoinfluenced by regeneration opportunities within the wider conservation area.Cllr Curran says he hopes a fresh application will meet with success to assist further the social and economic regeneration of not only Irish Street, but the wider town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch fete Schmidt  ","story":"IRELAND coach Joe Schmidt was the guest of honour at Ballymacarn Park on Friday when  members and guests enjoyed an excellent lunch followed by a question and answer session, conducted by club chairman Philip Gregg.He was his usual humble self as he described his coaching philosophy and the journey he has been on over the past  years and it was a wonderful afternoon for all in attendance.Despite his tight time schedule, Joe took the time to mingle with those present and was a complete gentleman throughout.

It has also a topic of considerable concern and a high profile environmental issue.Members of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee were told on Monday night that flytipping places a ldquosignicant demand on the organisationrsquos budget with staff also erted away from other duties to deal with the problem.Council officials are currently working alongside Environment Agency staff and neighbouring local authorities in what is being described as an attempt to ldquoadopt compatible practices and approaches to highlight the issue and reduce the scale of the problem.If the amount of the waste dumped mdash mostly in secluded areas mdash is greater than two cubic metres, or is hazardous, the incident is reported to the government agency. Council enforcement officers will also investigate each incident and assessthe culprits can be identied and prosecuted.On Monday night, councillors were told that over the past eight months there have been almost  reported fly tipping incidents across the district.Council staff responded to  incidents, with contractors removing waste on  occasions. Environment Agency staff removed waste on  occasions.While the cost of removing waste over the past eight months is estimated at almost pound,, council officials have suggested the yearly total could top the pound, mark.The cost of flytipping on hard pressed ratepayers comes just a few weeks after council officials were asked to look at innovative ways of combating the problem.Councillors are concerned about the scale of the issue and the restrictions being placed on what material ratepayers can dump at household recycling centres.Some elected representatives have suggested council officials should reintroduce a service used by the former Down Council which arranged for a local authority bin lorry to visit some towns and villages on a Saturday morning to allow people to get rid of their household waste.The scheme proved extremely popular and while it was in service there were few reported flytipping incidents in the area.In addition, community groups helped keep their respective towns and villages clean by taking part in litter picks, with their efforts recognised by the local authority via an awards scheme.Councillors also believe the fact that some of the districtrsquos household recycling centres do not accept certain types of waste is contributing to the scale of the flytipping issue which, they say, must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 19%2C 1978  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash Fears that Newcastlersquos status as a leboat base could be thrown on the rocks were sunk yesterday by the Royal National Leboat Institutionrsquos chief spokesman in Ireland, Lt-Col Brian Clark.In a clear-cut statement he dashed the hopes of  Kilkeel fishermen who have called for a full-scale rescue centre to be set up in their port instead of Newcastle.Lt-Col Clark, who is the RNLIrsquos organising secretary for all of Ireland, has also hit out strongly at claims that the prospect of a tug-orsquo-war situation is looming between Newcastle and Kilkeel.He said: ldquoKilkeel has indeed been considered carefully as a possible location for a leboat, but the major requirement is that a boat must be able to get away from its base promptly in all kinds of weather.ldquoThe RNLI management committee feels that this capability is at present lacking in the case of Kilkeel where strong winds create unfavourable conditions at the entrance to the new harbour. These conditions could prevent a leboat from ing to its moorings and may prevent it from getting out of the harbour on service.Lord Roden, the honorary secretary of the Newcastle leboat station, has also rejected the latest call to switch the leboat base from his town to Kilkeel.ldquoI can give an assurance that Newcastle is taking no part in such an argument, he said. ldquoThe stationing of boats on the coast is solely a matter for the RNLI management committee.ldquoThe Newcastle leboatmen are proud of their boat. They have been operating here since , butany change in the situation was introduced I think they would accept it.DRUMANESS mdash Teddy, the big-hearted golden labrador from Drumaness, who made a habit of carrying his masterrsquos schoolbag home from school each day, is missing. Owner, Patsy Tweedie, of Mullamore Drive, thinks he is dead.Teddy, who featured on the Recorderrsquos front page in February, hasnrsquot been around his home for over two weeks and this makes Mr Tweedie almost certain he is dead.ldquoTeddy had been running around with a bitch recently and came him peppered with pellets just before he disappeared, Mr Tweedie said. ldquoThat makes me believe he has been shot by some farmer who thought he was worrying sheep.ldquoIf that is the case I feel the farmer has made a mistake. Teddy wouldnrsquot worry sheep. He was far more interested in carrying my sonrsquos bag home from school and things like that. He was well known in the village and senior citizens were often thankful to have him around as a sort of watch dog.Mr Tweedie said there had been several cases of sheep worrying in the district recently and thatrsquos what led him to believe that a farmer may have shot him.He added: ldquoWe certainly miss him. One way or another, I would be interested to hear from anyone who saw him recently.KILLYLEAGH mdash Mr David Watson thought he had fought his last battle with the end of World War  mdash but he was wrong. Mr Watson, who is  and probably one of Killyleaghrsquos oldest residents, has been fighting a gruelling battle with the Housing Executive to obtain a house without stairs.At his Comber Road home Mr Watson and his  year-old we, Liza-Jane, have been tormented for a long time by problems which are easily overcome by the young, but cause massive complications for older citizens.The normally simple operation of climbing stairs is is a great task for Mrs Watson. Because of ill health, she has to crawl up to her bedroom on hands and knees and get back down on hands and knees.Spearheading the Watsonsrsquo case has been their daughter, Mrs Jean Cheevers, and after a long struggle she has finally managed to get good news for her parents.After bringing her case to the attention of the local MP, Mr Enoch Powell, Mr Gerry Fitt MP, Cllr Rowan-Hamilton, the Sunday News and the Down Recorder, she has at last evoked a reaction from the Housing Executive.The Executive has now decided to take a ldquohumanitarian attitude to the couplersquos case, therefore increasing their chances of getting a stair-free home.In a sympathetic letter to Mrs Cheevers, an Executive spokesman explained that full consideration had been given to the age and state of health of Mr and Mrs Watson.ldquoI should add that our ability to rehouse your parents in accommodation suitable to their needs will be dependent on such accommodation becoming available in the area, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK mdash A bumper medieval pageant proposed for Downpatrick in May to celebrate St Patrick is hanging in the balance mdash and only a large turnout at a public meeting early in the New Year can save it from the chop.The pageant, the brainchild of Down Councilrsquos arts committee, is seen to be one of the best ideas to come out of the district for some time mdash but unless sufficient backing is forthcoming, then the community festival will have to be scrubbed.Organisers have been guaranteed funds from Down Council, but in order to quality for a big payout by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board will have to have the potential to be a major tourist attraction and to be continued each year.Mr Frank Connolly, a spokesman for the arts committee told the Recorder: ldquoIf there is no support, there will be no festival, itrsquos as simple as that. Wersquore calling a public meeting for January  in the new library in Downpatrick and itrsquos essential that there is a massive turnout of interested people and of organisations who are willing to play a part.ldquoA successful event would no doubt help tourism and itrsquos in the interest of the district to give it their full support.BALLYGOWAN mdash A young handicapped Ballygowan boy received an extra Christmas surprise recently when his pet donkey gave birth to a baby foal.Seven year-old Gregory Townley suffers from spina bida but the new addition to the family is certain to add an extra sparkle to Christmas for him.His mother, Mrs Myrtle Townley, said: ldquoMy husband got a donkey for Gregory two years ago after he bought a motorbike for my nine year-old son Roy. The little foal was born two weeks ago and Gregory will now have twice as much to handle.ldquoHe has still not picked a proper name for the new addition.

Behind-the-scenes discussions are tang place in an attempt to end the monopoly of harbour facilities by the Strangford ferry and open up berths for smaller craft.Strangford, as a port of call for small boats, was virtually closed off several years ago with the expansion of the ferry service and ancillary facilities.The villagersquos past has always been linked with the harbour when an armada of small boats tied up at the harbour wall, particularly during the successful carnival days.DRUMNAQUOILE mdash Police are investigating the slaughter of three sheep and the injuring of ten others in the Drumnaquoile area.

It includes younger and older swimmers, male and female, with a range of abilities who swim every day come rain, hail or snow.Martin Strain said the group has been going informally for eight years but has grown notably in the last three. He said cold water plungeshelp members who have mental health issues.In Bangor, the Brompton Belles and Beaux have a core who swim every day at am. Marie-Therese Davis-Hanson started the group in  and said numbers have rocketed.One of the newest groups is Team Dash and Splash, whose members run along the coast before a plunge at Pickie Beach, Bangor on Sunday morning. Member and former Olympic swimmer Andrew Bree said it has been a big change from the warm indoor pools of his competitive career.“The water temperature gets down to around four five degrees in February and March here,” he said.“I got injured in  and left the sport not the way I wanted to and I think that affected me, but now I have found that love for the water again.“It strips the ego, when you get into the cold, there is no room for the past, there is no room for thoughts, you are focused on the present moment.Family’s thanks for Parker’s gt of le Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“My benefit was definitely mental, but there has also been a cardiovascular benefit, I have taken up more running and things I didn’t use to do. I come from a swimming background but I never liked running.“I think it’s from the cold, you are pumping that blood through the body, I just feel overall really good from it.”Dash and Splash founder Scott Riley said it started with a Facebook post in October .“I was going for a run and sea swim anyway, I got really interested in the health benefits of cold water and I was training to become a Wim Hof method instructor at that time which is a breathing and cold training technique for strengthening the nervous system,” he said.“The first week,  people turned up. It has grown and grown ever since. Even in January February there were - people turning up each week.“At our anniversary swim in October we had  people taking part.“There seems to be a push towards more outdoor activity, I think people intuitively know that it’s good for them, and maybe a societal sht where back in the day kids used to go out and get involved in nature, then computers came along and people got more indoor-oriented, but now the pendulum is shting back and people are realising that getting outdoors makes you happier, healthier and stronger.”try catch  TrendingMissing person found safe and wellEx-Isle of Man TT racer and TV presenter Guy Martin denies having fake Irish driving licenceGalgorm Resort and Spa evacuatedTwo stabbed: Man arrested on suspicion of attempted murderBrit-bashing by Irish will not change: Wilson          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
