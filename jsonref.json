She subsequently needed surgery to treat the medical condition, which again delayed her return to Monaco.   In the weeks after her arrival, Charlene remained absent from public duties. Albert later revealed the family reunion had gone \u0027pretty well\u0027 in the first few hours, but it then became \u0027pretty evident\u0027 that Charlene was \u0027unwell.\u0027He said the former Olympian \u0027realised she needed help\u0027, adding: \u0027She was overwhelmed and couldn\u0027t face official duties, life in general or even family life.\u0027Albert explained: \u0027I\u0027m probably going to say this several times, but this has nothing to do with our relationship. I want to make that very clear. These are not problems within our relationship not with the relationship between a husband and wife. It\u0027s of a different nature.\u0027He went on to tell a magazine her current state was a result of \u0027several factors which are private\u0027.Albert continued: \u0027She hadn\u0027t slept well in a number of days and she wasn\u0027t eating at all well. She has lost a lot of weight, which made her vulnerable to other potential ailments. A cold or the flu or God help us, COVID.\u0027 He said it is \u0027not cancer-related or personal relationship issue\u0027 and later said she is suffering from \u0027exhaustion, both emotional and physical\u0027.He later confirmed Charlene has been admitted to a treatment facility for undisclosed medical issues, as she works through a period of ill health. The location of the facility was not confirmed, though several sources claim it is in Switzerland.However friends of the princess spoke out to suggest the issues were more physical than Albert appeared to suggest. Speaking to Page Six, a source described as the royal\u0027s friend said: \u0027It is unfair that she is being portrayed as having some kind of mental or emotional issue. \u0027We don\u0027t know why the palace is downplaying that she almost died in South Africa.\u0027The source explained the royal had a severe ear, nose and throat infection, which resulted in \u0027severe sinus and swallowing issues stemming from an earlier surgery\u0027. Elsewhere friends of Princess Charlene gave Tatler a rare insight into what the royal is really like, insisting that the former swimmer is a force to be reckoned with. One source rubbished any public perception that Charlene is \u0027naive\u0027 and trapped in an unhappy marriage with Albert, saying: \u0027I don\u0027t for one second think she did not know what she was doing when she married him.\u0027 But one warned the mother of Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella, seven, is not the type to be blindly controlled by the Monaco royal household.\u0027Charlene is no Princess Di.\u0027 one said. \u0027She may come across as being extremely naïve, but nothing could be further from the truth. She is very good at keeping her smarts under wraps.\u0027Doubts about the central relationship of Monaco\u0027s royal family are not new. Several residents living in the narrow medieval alleys of Monaco Ville confirmed to MailOnline that before she left for South Africa Charlene was spending most of her time outside the Palace, living in a modest two-bedroom apartment above an old chocolate factory about 300m away, rather than in the 12th Century Palace itself.\u0027We often saw her outside the Palace and she would usually be alone or with a bodyguard,\u0027 said one source, \u0027but she was never with Albert - it was obvious she chose to spend most of her time in the apartment rather than the palace.\u0027Princess Charlene met Prince Albert in 2000 during a swimming competition in Monaco and the pair married in 2011, before welcoming twins Gabriella and Jacques in 2014.Born in Rhodesia- a previously unrecongised state in Southern Africa colonised by the British, she relocated to South Africa aged 11.She had a successful swimming career and went on to win three gold medals and a silver medal at the 1999 All Africa Games in Johannesburg, as well as representing South Africa at the 1998 and 2002 Commonwealth Games and winning a silver medal in the 4 × 100 m medley relay in the latter competition. However the pair\u0027s marriage has made numerous headlines over the years, with a third paternity suit emerging in December 2020. Soon afterwards Charlene famously shaved half her head in the style of a punk rocker. Months later she left for South Africa.The allegations in December 2020 claimed that Albert had fathered a love-child (which would be his third, if proven) with an unnamed Brazilian woman during the time when he and Charlene were already in a relationship.He has also fathered two other children outside of wedlock. Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, who is now 29 and the result of Albert\u0027s affair with an American estate agent, and Alexandre Coste, 18, whose mother is a former Togolese air hostess.Both children were struck off Monaco\u0027s line of succession in return for vast financial settlements."},{"url":null,"title":"Top Republican intelligence committee says Bidens slow response Zelensky cost lives","story":"Share this article The result has been growing pressure from lawmakers to help send the planes, while the Biden administration has at times got twisted up with multiple explanations about why the deal should not happen.Biden himself ignored shouted questions about the MiGs during public appearances on Wednesday.  But last week, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Ukraine\u0027s air force remained largely intact, and Russian planes were avoiding exposure by launching missiles inside their own airspace. \u0027Therefore, we believe that the gain from transferring those MIG-29s is low,\u0027 he said.\u0027And finally, the intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MIG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory. \u0027And could result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects of a military escalation with N.A.T.O.\u0027Biden has already ruled out a no-fly zone for fear of sparking World War Three with N.A.T.O. pilots going head to head with Russian flyers.And delivering the planes could bring the same outcome. Polish or American pilots flying into Ukraine risks Russia accusing N.A.T.O. of entering the war.Or if Ukrainian pilots travel to Poland to collect them, Moscow could accuse the Ukrainian air force of using foreign air fields - a potential \u0027casus belli\u0027 and grounds to attack Poland, according to a foreign diplomat familiar with discussions.So how about towing them across the border - something the U.S. did in World War Two, when it gave planes to Canada before formally ending the conflict.The White House has raised another distinction. Air defense systems, small arms and anti-tank weapons are defensive in nature, runs the argument, while Mig-29 fighter jets are offensive and capable of taking the fight to Russia.\u0027Again, I would note that the equipment that we\u0027ve provided is defensive, as you know, not offensive and we see that as being a difference,\u0027 said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday.But with the addition of deadly drones - as well as grenade launchers, rifles and shotguns - on the list supplied to Ukraine, she faced repeated probing about what was so different about sending planes.\u0027Anybody that looks at that list of weapons that I just mentioned, they would say clearly, they\u0027re offensive,\u0027 said John Decker of Fox News Radio. Psaki responded by saying: \u0027There is a difference between a plane, and planes, and massive military systems - I think anybody would recognise this.\u0027And what we were talking about, which is giving rifles and pistols to many of them farmers and people living in countrysides to defend themselves, I think there\u0027s a difference that most people recognize.\u0027       "},{"url":null,"title":"Amazon buys MGM 8 54bn deal Tech giant rights 7bn James Bond franchise","story":"Share this articleAmazon Buys MGM, Studio Behind James Bond, for $8.45 Billion - Variety"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/843b02ee614ddca39321a34d5837881a6e1d03e1/0_15_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=485c85eb9f95f9afb61c2a9fe76b7425","title":"bank of england interest rates inflation oil markets sterling russia bond payments business live","story":"Threadneedle Street’s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted 8-1 to increase borrowing costs by 0.25 percentage points – the first time the Bank has raised rates at three successive meetings in more than two decades.

At £9bn, Getit would slot straight into the FTSE 100 index above blue-chip names such as Rolls-Royce, Sainsbury’s or British Airways parent IAG. Sarah Riding, retail and supply chain partner at the law firm Gowling WLG, says Getir can use this funding to increase its footprint in several ways:  Shirtmaker TM Lewin has called in administrators for the second time in less than two years, the latest victim of the shift to working from home. The business, which operated 150 shops before the pandemic, has operated solely online business since first calling in administrators in June 2020. Administrators are looking for a buyer for the business but 50 jobs are at risk. Pippa Stephens, retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, says the move away from office dress codes in the pandemic has hurt TM Lewin: He says the way staff were informed they were losing their jobs was “completely unacceptable”. Courts says P\u0026ampO Ferries is suspending services for a week to 10 days while they locate new crew. He says four routes will be affected: Dover to Calais, Larne to Cairnryan, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam. He says this is primarily a commercial decision. There will be some disruption, he says, but people will still be able to travel to and from the UK. He says he does not expect the supply of goods and services to the UK to be affected. Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, says what happened to the workers who were sacked was a “national scandal”. At the afternoon lobby briefing Downing Street condemned the way P\u0026ampO Ferries sacked its 800 crew today. Andrew Sparrow’s Politics Liveblog has all the details: Is P\u0026ampO Ferries’ shock decision to  fire 800 staff with immediate effect legal? Tom Long, partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau, says the move “appears to contravene the requirements needed for a normal mass redundancy”, and could potentially lead to litigation, such as unfair dismissal claims. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits, or continuing claims, dropped by 71,000 to 1.42m in the week to March 5th. That’s the lowest level since February 1970. The number of people filing new claims for jobless support also dropped, down 15,000 to 214,000, showing that the US labor market remained robust this month - as the US Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates. Jesse Lee, senior advisor for communications to the National Economic Council, tweets: This information is shared as part of global collaboration to prevent non-compliance with tax rules. Today’s decision to suspend tax information exchange will ensure the UK is not supplying Putin’s regime with information that could lead to an increased tax benefit or yield for Russia, the government says.

Police have intervened after P\u0026ampO workers blocked a road leading to the Port of Dover, PA Media reports. Dozens of employees who lost their jobs on Thursday stood on the road holding banners and flags saying “Stop the P\u0026ampO jobs carve up”. It came after buses carrying agency workers hired to replace them appeared to arrive at the Kent port. A lorry driver trying to enter the port began shouting and beeping at those in the road, before being told “We’re not moving”. Police officers then attended the scene close to the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union office in Dover. One of the protesters, who had worked for the company for decades, told the PA news agency: Demonstrators then began chanting “Support local jobs” before moving to another road.But with growth likely to slow in 2023, the risk of a wage spiral currently looks modest, Nils points out. Here’s his full analysis: Lagarde told an ECB conference in Frankfurt that its Governing Council stands by the people of Ukraine, who have been “subjected to this horrific act of aggression” by Russia, and will implement the sanctions decided on by the EU, Lagarde also explained that Europeans face higher inflation and slower economic growth in the coming months: Manufacturing bottlenecks will also last for longer, she warned, which will keep durable goods prices high, meaning more inflation.

Derek O’Connor, Rob James and Patrick Mullins, who ride leading fancies School Boy Hours, Frontal Assault and Mister Fogpatches respectively, very much fall into the former category and may well be the ones to focus on.  Frontal Assault is the young potential improver, with just three chase starts, while School Boy Hours prevailed in the ultra-competitive Paddy Power Handicap Chase at Leopardstown in December. I’ll row in with Patrick Mullins and Mister Fogpatches though, as he’s a thorough stayer who will love the testing conditions and ran an excellent trial – on much faster ground – over course and distance when second here in December.Harry Fry’s unbeaten six-year-old Love Envoi is the only realistic challenger to a huge Irish contingent here, which is led by Willie Mullins’s Dinoblue. She doesn’t have a great deal of form but what there is looks rock-solid, as she romped 15 lengths clear of her field on debut at Clonmel in early January and several of those behind her have run with credit since.  If 7-4 is not your kind of price in a 20-runner race, Gordon Elliott’s Party Central may appeal as an alternative, having won three of her four starts over hurdles including a cosy win in a strong handicap at Leopardstown in February, but she is more exposed than the favourite and unlikely to find as much improvement.  A better each-way alternative may be Dinoblue’s stable companion Grangee, who fell two out in a Grade Three at Fairyhouse in January but had previously run really well against geldings in a Grade One at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting. She was just over three lengths behind Three Stripe Life, the runner-up in yesterday’s Ballymore, and has an obvious chance to reach the frame at least at around 9-1. Dinoblue has to be the one for the win, though. Terrific work from Adam Wedge to recover from a late mistake, and getting boxed in behind Slate House. And it’s another point on the board for British trainers – this time, it’s Wales’s Evan Williams. Jack Kennedy will ride Grand Paradis after Davy Russell, who has fallen twice today, pulled out. Fancy Foundations has joined Cavalry Master as a late non-runner.The first three names in the betting are all trained in British yards. The Glancing Queen, whose form over fences this year is 1-1-2, heads the list and her 10-length second behind L’Homme Presse, the winner of the Grade One Brown Advisory Novice Chase yesterday, on New Year’s Day suggests that an opening mark of 141 could be very much on the generous side. She faces some stiff opposition, however, not least from my pick Imperial Alcazar, a ready winner at the Trials meeting here in late January and, like the favourite, still unexposed after just three runs over fences.  Celebre D’Allen, meanwhile, has run just once over British fences, winning cosily at Warwick last month, but has a fair bit of experience in French chases earlier in his career which could stand him in good stead. Ireland’s challenge is led by Gordon Elliott’s novice Grand Paradis, with Cavalry Master a late non-runner.Thyme Hill held off a surging Paisley Park for second, and Champ edged Klassical Dream to take fourth place. What a performance from Allaho to retain his title. I’m also pleased to report that Conflated and Davy Russell are OK after that heavy fall at the second last.Shan Blue fades from contention, leaving Janidil and Eldorado Allen battling for second – it’s Mark Walsh and Janidil who prevails, completing a long-range 1-2 for Willie Mullins. The runners are out for the Ryanair Chase, taking a trot around the cross-country circuit as they wait for the race to begin ...The feature race of the day, and an intriguing cast of characters which includes the last three winners: Flooring Porter, Lisnagar Oscar and Paisley Park. Lisnagar Oscar was a 50-1 shot when he took this two years ago and has yet to add another win to his record in nine attempts, making him a big outsider again today, but Flooring Porter and Paisley Park will both have plenty of supporters and yesterday’s rain could play to Paisley Park’s strong-finishing running style in particular. Champ, who was one of the favourites for last year’s Gold Cup but was pulled up before halfway, is another interesting contender though he could not cope with a revived Paisley Park in the Cleeve last time. Klassical Dream, who was Ruby Walsh’s last Festival winner in the 2019 Supreme Novice Hurdle, is back at the meeting for the first time since, having suffered from all manner of injury problems in the meantime before rediscovering Grade One-winning form at staying trips. He is closely matched with Flooring Porter on some recent form but was way below his best in late January after a tough race against Flooring Porter at Christmas. The defending champion, though, has been kept fresh for this and that could tip the balance his way.Allaho bids to repeat last year’s runaway win in this race and also improve the record of odds-on shots at this year’s meeting to 3-1, after Shishkin’s bitterly disappointing run in the Champion Chase yesterday. He has looked as rock-solid as anything at the meeting from some way out and Paul Townend, who watched on from afar aboard Min as Rachael Blackmore steered Allaho home last year, will be confident of securing another win.  Conflated looks likely to be the biggest threat after winning the Irish Gold Cup at the Dublin Racing Festival last time and the decision to opt for this race rather than the Gold Cup itself was probably the smart choice. Even that form gives him plenty to find with an on-song Allaho, though, and while he remains quite lightly-raced for an eight-year-old with just 10 starts over fences behind him, it is still a very big ask.“I think he’s a Gold Cup horse, he’s one of the best in Henry’s yard so I wouldn’t be too disheartened today as I know that wasn’t the true Bob, for whatever reason I don’t know, but we’re lucky to have him.” And Willie Mullins, who saw Galopin Des Champs fall at the last while well clear: “He’s fine. I think Paul is probably sorer than the horse is. Paul just said he landed well and slipped on his next stride. We move on. It’s disappointing, but we have a sound jockey and a sound horse and we live to fight another day.” “It’s tough, but it looks like we could have a very special on horse on our hands. I’m delighted I ran him in that race because I can go back to two miles now. It has always been in the back of my mind that we could go back in trip with him.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: In 1850, as famine raged, Captain Houstoun asked Lord Sligo of Westport if he knew of any land that could carry 10,000 sheepStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the guinness is great thousands pack into dublin for st patrick s day parade","story":"Speaking to press at the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, Irish-American actor John C Reilly says the St Patrick\u0027s Day parade is a “great opportunity to spread joy”.The parade opened with a show of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, with a group of Irish and Ukrainians carrying symbols of both countries  – shamrocks of Ireland and sunflowers of Ukraine.   Photograph: by Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThousands of people packed into Dublin city centre for the first St Patrick’s Day parade in two years, the crowd a throng of green, Tricolours, shamrocks and leprechaun costumes.The parade opened with a show of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, with a group of Irish and Ukrainians carrying symbols of both countries – shamrocks of Ireland and sunflowers of Ukraine.The group walked down O’Connell Street holding the flags of Ireland and Ukraine. Racheal Diyaolu, a medical student from Carlow who was forced to flee Ukraine following the Russian invasion, was among the group, carrying the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine.The parade started from Parnell Square shortly before 1pm, with the route coming down O’Connell Street, moving around College Green and Dame Street, looping down Lord Edward Street, past St Patrick’s Cathedral, to finish on Kevin Street at around 3pm.Tom Yingling (53) from Vancouver, Canada, was among the crowd, having made a “bucket list” trip to Ireland for the first time.Decked out in a green sequined shamrock suit, he said he had wanted to visit Ireland his “ whole life”, making the trip with his son Jack and a colleague.“Yesterday morning we got in about 8am, and we hit the town last night, went to Temple Bar, went and did the Guinness factory tour,” he said.“People are friendly, and the Guinness is great,” he said.Dressed as a leprechaun, Mathias Machek (42), from Vienna, Austria, was another of the many tourists in the crowd who had travelled to Dublin for St Patrick’s Day. “Last year we said we wanted to come but corona, this year we said we’d come, and make some party,” he said.After the parade he said he would be heading to Temple Bar, and a planned tour of the city would have to wait until tomorrow.Mariya Osadchuk, a Ukrainian woman living in Ireland, said the gesture of solidarity at the start of the parade was “very nice”. The Irish people had been “very friendly” to the women and children of Ukraine since the outbreak of war in her country, she said.Elsewhere in the crowd, four-year-old Nina was at the parade with her parents, Michelle Considine and Harry Buckless. “She’s really excited, we went on one of the fairground rides over at the quays,” her mother said.The atmosphere in Temple Bar was jovial throughout the afternoon, with the large crowds in good spirits, and no sense of trouble.Festival organisers said as many as 400,000 people could be in Dublin city for the celebrations.Olympic and Paralympic sporting heroes Kellie Harrington and Ellen Keane are the grand marshals of the parade, with Irish-American actor John C Reilly, who starred in the film Step Brothers, the international guest of honour.Harrington described the opportunity to parade through her local streets as “fantastic”.“For myself and Ellen to be grand marshals, two female athletes, it’s amazing and it shows the strength in female sport, it’s always been there,” she said.“To be chosen to walk through our city as grand marshals is fantastic. It’s great to show younger kids coming up that if they work hard they can achieve anything.”Dublin city centre off-licences have been asked not to sell alcohol until 4pm, to prevent crowds drinking alcohol on the streets, particularly while families are in Dublin city for the parade. Restaurants and pubs have also been asked to ensure any alcohol sold was consumed on the premises.There will be more than 650 gardaí working in Dublin city centre on Thursday, with gardaí warning there will be a “zero tolerance” approach to on-street drinking. Stewards and gardaí are to manage the flow of people into Temple Bar, in order to control the crowds in the popular tourist spot.Cork cityMeanwhile, a charity which played a vital role in the transportation of blood samples, medication, equipment and human donor milk to medical centres all over Ireland throughout the pandemic served as the grand marshal of the Cork city Patrick’s Day parade.Martin O’Driscoll, Chairman of Blood Bike South, joked that the volunteers were surprised to find themselves out in daylight hours – much less in such a prestigious role.“We were formed in 2012 so it is our 10th anniversary this year. At the moment we have about 65 volunteers on our books.More than 50,000 people attended the festivities which got underway in Cork city centre shortly after 1pm. The theme of the parade was “Heroes – Ordinary People in Extraordinary Times”. Participants included Rebel Wheelers, Mayfield GAA, the Indian Community Cork, the Cork Barrack Street Band, Sanctuary Runners and the Rising Sun School of Karate.It featured more than 2,500 local community participants and visiting groups from the US – including Massachusetts State Troopers, Philadelphia Irish Trad Tours and the Bixby Ruby group from Oklahoma.Poignantly, Polish support group, Together Razem, were led out by recent Ukrainian arrivals to Cork. They were in turn supported by iniduals from Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary, Georgia and Lithuania.The group received a rapturous reception from the crowd with the annual sea of green white and gold flags being interspersed with Ukrainian flags in a show of solidarity with iniduals from the war-torn country.NationwideThere were also parades in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and many other towns and villages across the country.Throughout the northwest, Ukrainian families , frontline healthcare workers and GAA stars were among those honoured at St Patrick’s Day parades.Recent arrivals from Ukraine to Leitrim were chosen to lead the parade in Carrick-on-Shannon, while healthcare workers were honoured at the festivities in Boyle, Co Roscommon.Colm McGrath, president of Carrick chamber of commerce which organised the celebration in the town, said they had invited recently arrived Ukrainian refugees to be grand marshals “to show that the people of Carrick and of Leitrim stand beside them at this time”.Mr McGrath who has welcomed three generations of one Ukrainian family into his home said there had been an outpouring of support in the county for people whose lives have been turned upside down, and the parade was an opportunity to show solidarity.Meanwhile in nearby Cootehall, the organisers of Ardcarne parish parade chose their parish priest Fr Brendan McDonagh to be St Patrick for the day, but it was Roscommon GAA stalwarts, brothers Donie and Enda Smith who were invited to lead the parade through the village as grand marshalls.There was a festive atmosphere in Cootehall with much of the action located in the vicinity of the John McGahern Barracks Museum, once home to the writer and his siblings, and where their father Frank served as sergeant.The organisers of the parade in Boyle, Co Roscommon, used the opportunity to pay tribute to healthcare staff for their contribution during the pandemic. The grand marshals were nurse Shini Joy from the Plunkett nursing care unit and Cathy Weston, director of care at Drumderrig House.“It’s just a way to say thank you to all healthcare workers who have been through a lot for the last two years,” said Lorcan Egan, one of the parade organisers.In Sligo, mayor of the town, Cllr Arthur Gibbons, urged the crowd to try to forget their cares for the day. “This is a day for the Irish all over the world,” he said. “We have had a horrible two years of lockdown which brought the country nearly to its knees”.The Sinn Féin councillor acknowledged the pain caused by the war in Ukraine and said it was important to send a message “of love and luck” from Irish people.“I would say to people leave your worries to tomorrow and have this day to remember,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre.

Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics lionel barber on putin and how the west should deal with him","story":"As Russia’s brutal assault on Ukraine enters its fourth week, with little sign of an outcome, the question of what an endgame of this war might look like is increasingly the subject of international debate.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Ratcliffe’s wife of seven years, was taking their baby daughter, Gabriella, to see her parents in Iran.Mr Ratcliffe, then 37, expected them back two weeks later. But when Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe reached Imam Khomeini Airport for her and Gabriella’s flight home, she was arrested by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.Her detention shocked Britain and plunged Mr Ratcliffe, a City auditor from West Hampstead with no prior involvement in public life, into a geopolitical quarrel decades in the making. As Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s imprisonment dragged on into months and then years, Mr Ratcliffe fought to keep her in the mind of the public and the Government.“This is an accountant from north London whose life has been completely transformed,” Tulip Siddiq, the couple’s local Labour MP, told the Financial Times. “He never thought he would lead a life of juggling media demands from dawn into the night, or dealing with government officials. An accountant is about as far removed as you can be from this world.”Thus began a painfully public ordeal. Unable to sleep or work, Mr Ratcliffe blamed himself. “She was alone,” he wrote in an article for Sky News in 2017. “All I could think of was: ‘I had left her alone.’”He set up a petition for her release that garnered half a million signatures. He went on hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy. In 2021, he did the same outside the Foreign Office, this time for 21 days, with his sister Rebecca, a GP who works in Cwmbran, south Wales, closely monitoring his health. Looking haggard and tired, Mr Ratcliffe told BBC News: “I’m not backing down.”Mr Ratcliffe’s family has staunchly supported him in public and in private. His parents, Hampshire-dwelling John and Barbara, have told The  of the family’s weekly calls to discuss Nazanin’s plight and their fortnightly call with the Foreign Office. But they admitted there was little they could do to assuage their son’s torment. “It’s ghastly,” said Barbara, “because he’s our baby.”It was not until October 2019 that Mr Ratcliffe was reunited with Gabriella, who had been staying with her Iranian grandparents. Mr Ratcliffe admitted that he might be a “rusty” parent, displaying a candour also evidenced in his account of his wife’s frustration about things he might have said or done better in his quest to free her.Along with his honesty, it is his bravery that has won Mr Ratcliffe admirers across the political spectrum – despite his defiance of Foreign Office warnings to stay discreet.“His quiet courage,” Jeremy Hunt told the Financial Times last November, “is a deafening rebuke to those who think it is acceptable to use innocent people as pawns in diplomatic power games.”Mr Hunt, as foreign secretary, had lobbied Iran for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release.Ms Siddiq told the House of Commons this week: “I want to pay tribute to my constituent Richard Ratcliffe for his relentless campaigning, but I also think he’s really set the bar high for all husbands.”Mr Ratcliffe’s love for his wife has been a visible source of motivation. “It’s not a Mills \u0026amp Boon story,” he told the New Statesman during one of his hunger strikes. “But I do think it’s important that she knows, always, that I’m there for her.”With his wife safely returned to the UK, Mr Ratcliffe can resume a family life that had been on pause for six years. The day before she was due to return, he spoke to TV camera crews outside his home, with Gabriella at his side, and said that the next few days would hold “a bit of tidying, perhaps directed by Mummy,” and “a cup of tea.”“I suppose we can stop being a moment in history,” he told broadcasters, “and start being a normal family again.”The couple had met through friends in 2007, when Ms Zaghari, as she was then, was studying for a master’s degree in communication management at London politan University.The first meeting, Mr Ratcliffe once told BBC News, was “a really easy conversation. We just talked and talked and talked.”It felt, he said, “like coming home” – a feeling that, at long last, the family can enjoy once more.More from NewsTraitors, scum and patriots: was this Putin\u0026#39s most Stalin-esque speech to date?Ukraine-Russia latest news: Family of five among 53 killed in \u0026#39nightmarish\u0026#39 Chernihiv bombardmentPostcard from Stalinville – where \u0026#39dark tourism\u0026#39 turns a blind eye to historySadiq Khan: Met officers who strip searched black teenager should be charged with gross misconductMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russell brand became mad hatter conspiracy theories","story":"The mockney messiah with a man bun has found a new calling. Russell Brand, formerly known for stand-up comedy, hosting reality shows and making incendiary phone calls about granddaughters of Fawlty Towers actors, can now be found posting ‘truth-seeking’ daily videos and weekly podcasts to some 10m people across YouTube and Instagram. Recent episodes include ‘You’ve Been LIED To About Why Ukraine War Began’ ‘Can We REALLY Trust Vaccine Fact-Checkers??!’, and ‘Trump was RIGHT About Clinton \u0026amp Russia Collusion!!’. It’s all a far cry from the man three times named ‘S------ of the Year’ by The Sun.The charismatic Brand, who became ubiquitous in the mid-Noughties, has harnessed his popularity into virtual populism, his ‘anti-partisan’ videos winning millions of fans across both Left and Right. The 15-minute posts usually begin with thanks to “awakened beings” for joining the “journey to truth” he has defended both Putin and Trump, decries billionaires, and wants to root out racism. Brand detests authority – mass media and the Government being the primary evils – and wants revolution. So much so that he wrote a book of that name in 2014 (from the country pile of his then-girlfriend, heiress Jemima Khan).Seemingly modelling himself on Joe Rogan – the controversial US podcasting phenom who followed the stand-up to reality presenter to populist pundit pipeline to become one of the most powerful figures in American media – Brand promises to “say the unsayable”, earning himself a loyal, and large, following. The 46-year-old says he is not there to flout conspiracy theories, but to ask questions and “create new narratives” – a similar defence employed by Rogan, who in January found himself at the centre of a scandal after being accused of peddling Covid mistruths.One episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 11m listeners, resulted in a letter from more than 270 doctors slamming the programme as a “menace to public health”. Neil Young and Joni Mitchell told Spotify, the platform on which his podcast is streamed, that it had to ditch Rogan or their back catalogues Rogan won out. The brouhaha only solidified the status that the podcasting behemoths now wield – which is good news for brand Brand.There are major differences in their approaches, however. While both are martial arts fans keen to host isive figures – Rogan’s include ex-NRA leader and Sandy Hook-denier Alex Jones, academic Jordan Peterson and Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-Right Proud Boys group – the US presenter’s hours-long conversations belie a genuine desire to find what makes his interviewees tick. Brand is a different beast, his videos a stream of verbal ablutions that begin with a plea for viewers to buy tickets to his live tour (his T-shirts bearing anti-Government slogans sell for £25.99). ‘Stay Free’ is splashed across merch from tea towels to phone cases and mugs, the latter of which also features his face. His site promises that “grants using money generated by this endeavour” will be made, though no further details are provided.Brand – an avowed anti-capitalist with a net worth over £10m, according to Spear’s – was criticised for his 2017 book Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions, which some said was a for-profit version of the 12-step programme used for alcohol and drug addicts (which is available for free). “The point is that you don’t profit from the 12 steps,” says an insider who knew Brand as his star was rising that is “really frowned upon”. But he’s “very funny, he’s very charming,” she admits. “When I was with him, I felt like I was the only person in the world.”It is this “incredible ability to make people feel as though he’s talking just to them” that has supercharged his online success. “This is what it feels like to be part of a conversation,” he tells viewers in a video posted this week: “to be heard, to be seen.”Henry Jeffreys saw that appeal up close in 2007, when working as a publicist for My Booky Wook – Brand’s sex and drink-fuelled memoir. “People loved him,” he recalls of Brand’s effusive chats with old ladies and security guards. Back then, Brand was a household name, thanks to hosting E4’s spin-off show Big Brother’s Big Mouth, appearing in Hollywood films from Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Get Him to the Greek, and tabloid-documented liaisons with Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Geri Halliwell (and many, many more).By the middle of the last decade, Brand had interviewed Holocaust-denier David Icke on multiple occasions and, in 2015, invited the would-be Labour leader Ed Miliband on his YouTube show, The Trews (a portmanteau of True News), so great was his appeal among young voters deemed to be by politicians. Brand, at the time, was not registered to vote.“There are particular iniduals within the anti-vaccine world who are amenable to pro-Russian propaganda,” according to Imran Ahmed, executive director of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, who notes that there is also crossover among supporters of QAnon (the group who believed Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles across the government, media and corporate worlds). Rather than these groups fading with Covid, experts warn that the same mindset – dismissing the prevailing logic so as to deny the status quo, no matter the evidence – will merely be transferred to other crises.This has also led to hybrid conspiracies: such as that the US has long had a secret, illegitimate bioweapons lab in Ukraine, which now works with bat-borne coronavirus samples, which Russia is simply attempting to destroy.Brand never clearly nails down his own views, “discussing” conspiracies, so as to skirt accusations of being a conspiracist. He is helped somewhat by those who still associate him with his cheeky Noughties screen persona and former marriage to pop star Katy Perry, as well as his quest for wellness – the subject of another of his YouTube channels – and faithful practise of yoga and veganism, all of which obfuscate possible sightings of tin foil hats.He is currently touring the UK with ‘The 33’, which consists of three segments – his back story, the hypocrisy of the Government during the pandemic, and a meditation with the crowd. An Instagram post from Monday’s show in Sheffield features him clasping the hands of an audience member, as others watch on in wonder at what Brand called “a magical meeting of souls”.Rogan’s brand remains more steak and dumbbells than spinach and savasanas. But the pair share a great deal: both are “funny and fearless”, says listener Jon Miltimore, 42, who appreciates their ability to “talk intelligently about complex ideas and provocative ideas” these are men who aren’t “afraid to poke at those sacred cows, and to question authority”.They share mutual affection, too. “You’ve emerged authentically,” Rogan told his British counterpart during a marathon three-and-a-half-hour episode of his podcast in 2019. “This is who you really are… you found yourself.”Brand – who posted videos of support over Rogan’s Spotify debacle earlier this year – also cited him in his 2019 book, Mentors, in a nod to his “influence and impact.” With a net worth of around £92m, Rogan is still around 10 times bigger than Brand – but with his YouTube subscribers climbing by a million in a month, that gap may yet be closing.My Booky Wook was a bestseller My Conspiracy Wiracy is looking like a dead cert.More from NewsTraitors, scum and patriots: was this Putin\u0026#39s most Stalin-esque speech to date?Ukraine-Russia latest news: Family of five among 53 killed in \u0026#39nightmarish\u0026#39 Chernihiv bombardmentPostcard from Stalinville – where \u0026#39dark tourism\u0026#39 turns a blind eye to historySadiq Khan: Met officers who strip searched black teenager should be charged with gross misconductMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"starmer has turned labour one man show","story":"It was an unnecessary jibe which just felt out of place in a Commons that felt ready to celebrate the release with the rest of the country. Voters like to hear politicians uniting behind a single cause they even enjoy hearing opposition MPs praising government ministers when they get something right (that enjoyment perhaps being all the more appreciated because of its rarity). But to do so would have meant conceding that not everything Johnson’s government does is intrinsically evil, so Rayner ruled that out.In 1994, when he made his debut as Leader of the Opposition at the despatch box, Tony Blair’s very first words to the then prime minister, John Major, were in praise of the government’s efforts to secure peace in Northern Ireland. No one thought that the Labour leader was letting anyone off the hook by making common cause with the government.Instead of fretting about the nightmare scenario in which the Ukraine crisis allows Boris Johnson to recover his polling magic and lead his party to another general election victory, Labour needs to substitute oppositionalism for judgment, something that Starmer promised in his very first comments as Labour leader in April 2020.

He famously promised to wipe out Chechen terrorists “even in the “sh--house”, adding bluntly, “end of story.”Moreover, the Russian President once rounded on a French correspondent, who dared to question his assault on Chechnya, with an invitation to Moscow to be circumcised “since you’re so keen to be an Islamic radical”.But in this week’s speech to Russian regional bosses, apparently intended to convince them of the righteousness of the war in Ukraine (and steel them for the economic backlash), Putin reached down into the rhetorical sewer, dredging up lurid turns of phrase that brought to mind the very worst years of Russia’s not-so-distant past – the Stalinist purges of the 1930s.Pause for a moment over the following paragraph:“Any nation, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into the mouth, spit them on to the pavement. I am convinced that this natural and necessary self-purification of society would strengthen our country, our solidarity and cohesion and our readiness to respond to any challenge.”Was Putin intentionally channeling Stalin? The paragraph is certainly full of Stalinist dog-whistles, the vocabulary used by a paranoid leader to whip up a frenzy of patriotism in the face of real and imagined enemies.No Russian leader since communist days, as far as I can recall, has taken to describing his critics as “scum and traitors”, and none has suggested that criticising Kremlin policy is not just wrong-headed but “unpatriotic”. “Spitting them out” is typical Putinesque rhetoric – but what are we to make of his description of this as the “self-purification” of society? The very word, in Russian – samoochishchenie – comes from the same root as the word used to describe Stalin’s Great Purge: chistka.And there was more from Stalin’s lexicon. The West had established a “fifth column” of “national traitors” in Russia, who aimed to ide the country, provoke civil unrest, and “dismember Russia as they see fit”.Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was asked to elucidate what all this meant. The traitors, he explained, “vanish from our lives themselves. Some people are leaving their posts, some are leaving their active work life, some leave the country and move to other countries.”The fact is, many Russians, unable to cope with the hysteria and intolerance of Putin’s war regime, are indeed packing up and leaving. Independent journalists, their stations or websites closed down, have fled to neighbouring countries. Noted academics, including some of the most astute commentators on Russian politics, have fallen silent since the invasion. Is that the kind of “self-purification” that Putin hails? Or are they getting out before the rhetoric is ratcheted up to yet another level and Russia’s “patriots” are encouraged to take this purification business into their own hands?This speech, with its Stalinist overtones, was aimed not at its immediate audience of regional governors, but at the growing numbers of Russians who oppose the war but – so far – are too afraid to make their views public. Marina Ovsyannikova, the TV producer who heroically protested during the main news programme on Monday night, was an exception. But her views will be shared by many of her colleagues – not to mention thousands of others in the country’s universities, institutes, cultural circles and middle classes. Putin has put them on notice: if you dare to make your views known this is not just opposition, it is treason.Putin’s view of the world around him has gone through several transformations in his 22 years in power. In the early years he wooed the West, anxious to be accepted. Then, perceiving the West’s coolness towards him, he became angry, and started lecturing the Americans about their arrogance and vision of themselves as morally superior. But in 2012 he began making speeches that announced something new: his conviction that Russia, not America, was the exceptional nation in the world.And so he reserved special contempt in Wednesday’s speech for Russians who see Western values as “a sign of belonging to a superior caste, a superior race.” His handy list of what, to him, represents the West was instructive: “foie gras, oysters and gender freedom, as they call it”.What the speech makes clear is that Putin’s war in Ukraine is part of something much greater. He sees himself as the leader of a crusade to protect Russia from Western values. “Russia,” he says, “will never be seen in such a miserable and humiliated situation, and the fight we are waging is the fight for our sovereignty and the future of our country and our children. We will fight for the right to be and remain Russia.”Putin hates the West so much that he wants to stamp it out even in people’s minds. His definition of the “fifth column, the national traitors” was this: “people who make money here in our country but live over there, and ‘live’ not in the geographical sense of the word but in their minds, in their servile mentality.”This is a whole new level of madness. Putin appears to be telling Russians it’s not enough just to live and earn in Russia: you have to free yourself of Western thought and learn to “think” in some exalted Russian way, that only he knows how to define. It goes without saying that this is the language not of a normal politician, not even of a war leader. It is the language of a fanatic, a man convinced of his own brilliance and exceptionalism. And yet, so deluded that he cannot even see why Ukrainians – and the vast majority of people in the West, not to mention many in Russia itself – are repelled by him. Angus Roxburgh is the author of The Strongman, Vladimir Putin and the Struggle for Russia.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Family of five among 53 killed in \u0026#39nightmarish\u0026#39 Chernihiv bombardmentPostcard from Stalinville – where \u0026#39dark tourism\u0026#39 turns a blind eye to historySadiq Khan: Met officers who strip searched black teenager should be charged with gross misconductExoMars mission suspended as European Space Agency cuts ties with RussiaSoaring fuel prices mean UK ‘heading for a de facto lockdown’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"defence secretary blasts russian dirty","story":"Defence Secretary blasts Russian dirty tricks after call from fake Ukraine PMDefence Secretary Ben Wallace said an imposter called him pretending to be the Ukrainian PM but he hung up when they asked misleading questionsBen Wallace slammed Russian dirty tricks Image: NurPhoto PA ImagesByLizzy BuchanDeputy Online Political EditorBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsDefence Secretary Ben Wallace has said an imposter called him up pretending to be the Ukrainian Prime Minister and asked several misleading questions.The top Tory blasted the move as a desperate attempt by Russia to ert attention away from its brutal invasion of Ukraine in what appeared to be a security breach.It was not clear how an imposter was able to reach the Defence Secretary, who travelled to Poland on Thursday for talks on the Ukraine conflict. Mr Wallace has ordered an immediate inquiry to find out how the impostor was able to speak to him. He tweeted: Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me. He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call.

Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to “pulverise” Ukrainian cities after getting “bogged down” and meeting “fierce” resistance, Western officials warned. Kremlin troops were “making little bits of progress here and there, but they are not achieving a strategic breakthrough at any point”, they said. Vladimir Putin aposs invaders have “taken substantial casualties” and a death toll of , was “not an implausible estimate”.Military top brass have ordered reservists from “some quite peripheral places around Russia and its borders, which clearly was not part of the original plan”, they added. The redeployments “demonstrate the extent to which Russia has got bogged down”, with morale among its soldiers “very, very low”. Kremlin warplanes have still failed to win the aerial battle with Ukraine’s air force, with the skies “heavily contested” and Moscow fighter planes moving with “considerable caution” to dodge air defences.  An official said: “It’s clearly not going the way Russia planned it.” Warning of an intensication of artillery strikes on major population centres, they went on: “The Russian strategy appears to be to bombard city centres to try and pulverise the resistance within them and to encircle them wherever possible. “I would expect that to continue.” Kremlin military planners may be unsure of whether to launch a full attack on the capital, Kyiv, it is understood. “I think there is a question now as to whether Moscow intends to assault Kyiv or not,” one official said. “To do so, with or without bombardment, would be very costly for Russia.” They added: “An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders would be a very costly business. “There comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBen WallaceVladimir PutinSoldiersHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet despite unveiling gloom-laden inflation projections in next Wednesday’s Spring Statement, the Chancellor will raise benefits by just .%.That is £. a month on Universal Credit and comes after a £-a-week cut in October.The gulf will leave Universal Credit claimants £ worse off next year and drag , more people into poverty, the charities calculated.It comes after shock research by the Resolution Foundation last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after Russia ’s Ukraine invasion.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this is accurate, and fear inflation could go even higher - even hitting %. That would smash the .% peak last hit in .  Fty-nine charities including the Child Poverty Action Group , Citizens Advice, Save the Children and Oxfam, issued a joint statement to MPs today. It said: “The soaring costs of essentials will hurt low-income families, whose budgets are already at breaking point, most.” It added: “A second cut to benefits in six months is unthinkable. “The government should increase benefits by at least % in April to match inflation, and ensure support for housing costs increases in line with rents. “All those struggling, including families affected by the benefit cap, must feel the impact.”  The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost. Allies of the Chancellor believe boosting benefits would force him to raise public sector pay, pensions and other help too. Officials are also resisting any bid to give more help for energy bills before this Aprilaposs rise, instead waiting for another rise in October. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”. They added: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” A Government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £ billion this financial year and next to help. This includes putting an average of £, more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to Universal Credit, freezing fuel duties to keep costs down and helping households with their energy bills through our £. billion Energy Bills Rebate. “We’re also boosting the minimum wage by more than £, a year for full-time workers and our £ million Household Support Fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsOxfamThe TreasuryCitizens Advice BureauSave the ChildrenSpring StatementEnergy billsMinimum wage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But it acknowledged an error occurred in making a sale following an inquiry by a customer, with the store adding that it is adhering to sanctions outlined by the UK Government.Harrods responded after Labour MP Chris Bryant raised concerns that Russian vodka remains available in some major UK department stores as he accused firms of not really pulling their weight in imposing sanctions on Russia.The former minister told the House of Commons that bottles of Beluga vodka are available underneath the counter at Harrods while it is on the shelves at Selfridges. He also raised concerns over other companies still doing business in Russia. A Harrods spokeswoman said: Over a week ago, we removed products % sourced from Russia from the shelves of Harrods.  “This decision was taken alongside other steps such as changing the name of chicken kiev to chicken kyiv in our food hall, and halting deliveries to Russia. While Beluga vodka was removed from sale, remaining stock was held in storage ahead of being moved off site. After an inquiry by a customer, it was mistakenly brought out of stock and given to the customer. This was an error and should not have happened. All remaining stock has now been moved to an off-site location and is not available for sale. Exports of high-end luxury goods to Russia have been banned and import tarfs have been raised on hundreds of goods under UK economic sanctions on the country.The Government this week said Russian vodka would be among goods worth about £ million to be hit with an extra % tarf as it continued to inflict punitive measures in response to Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine.The export ban is expected to hit Russiaaposs access to luxury British vehicles, high-end fashion and works of art. Mr Bryant told the Commons: Can I ask for a debate on those who are not really pulling their weight in delivering sanctions on Russia over Ukraine  Because lots of shops in the UK have now withdrawn Russian products from their shelves, butyou still want to buy a £ bottle of Beluga vodka, for instance, you just go to Selfridges - itaposs on the shelvesyou go to Harrods, you actually have to ask for it and itaposs underneath the counter, literally underneath the counter. But also there are British companies who are still doing business in Russia, like Subway and Pirelli and Baker Tilly, who provide advice on how to hide your money. Isnapost it time that everybody pulled their weight because thataposs the only way we can make Putin fail  Commons Leader Mark Spencer said Mr Bryant was right to draw the Houseaposs attention to these matters. He added: Heaposs right that the only way in which we send the strongest message to that regime in Russia is to stick together and hold firm. I think heaposs right to ask for that debate and Iaposm sure thereaposll be methods - either through an adjournment debate or backbench business - for the House to continue to draw attention to those who are not condemning or issuing those sanctions as they should be. A spokesman for Subway said: Subway has no corporate operations in Russia. There are approximately  franchised restaurants in Russia which are all independently owned and operated by local franchisees and managed by an independent master franchisee. We donapost directly control these independent franchisees and their restaurants, and have limited insight into their day-to-day operations. While we do not control or manage the operations of independent franchisees in Russia, we will redirect any profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts supporting Ukrainians who have been affected by the war. We are also working with our franchisees across Europe to provide meals to refugees. Baker Tilly International said it will separate member firms in Russia and Belarus from our global network. In a statement, the company said: This decision is a direct consequence of the actions of these governments, and not the iniduals of these countries. Baker Tilly International firms will not serve government clients or state-owned enterprises of Russia or Belarus, or sanctioned entities and iniduals. It said this process will take some time and it remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our team members and their families in Ukraine. The statement added: We are mobilising financial and logistical support to ease their suffering, and we are continuing to raise critical funds for organisations providing direct humanitarian aid.

Fellow Brit Anousheh Ashouri, who was detained in , has also been freed and the pair are expected to arrive at home later tonight. Morad Tahbaz, an American-Iranian national, who also holds British citizenship, remains in Iran but he has been released on furlough from prison.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: I can confirm Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and Anoosheh Ashoori willto the UK today, and Morad Tahbaz has been released from prison on furlough.They will be reunited with their families later today. We will continue to work to secure Moradaposs departure from Iran.Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was held by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on trumped up national security charges in  after a holiday to introduce her young daughter Gabriella to her parents. Her husband Richard, who lives with six-year-old Gabriella in Hampstead, London, has campaigned tirelessly for her release, including by going on hunger strike in October last year. Mr Ashouri, a retired engineer, was arrested in  on spying charges after travelling out to visit his mother. Conservationist Morad Tabaz was detained by the authorities in .The news comes after efforts by five British Foreign Secretaries tried to secure their release, including Boris Johnson who was widely criticised for telling a Commons committee in  that she was teaching journalism in the country. Her family have always denied the claim.Ms Truss and Foreign Office officials have been engaged in intensive behind-the-scenes talks to secure their release and officials finally found a way to settle a -year-debt.  Hereaposs how the deal was done. Negotiations have been underway for a long time over securing the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe and other British nationals in Iran. Talks are understood to have intensied over the past six months, with help from the authorities in Oman. The pair are due to touch down in the Gulf state before ing to the UK later today. Alongside these talks, the UK has also settled a £ million debt to Iran which has proved a stumbling block to the release of British dual nationals. The -year row centres on Britainaposs sale of tanks to the Shah of Iran in the s. But the UK refused to send the tanks after the Iranian revolution, when the Shah was overthrown. Britain has today paid the debt, which appears to have been a signicant moment in the release of the detainees.  Officials have been working around the clock to find ways to pay the debt while complying the international sanctions imposed on Iran. The Foreign Office finally agreed that the funds can solely be used for humanitarian purposes. Ms Truss said it had been done in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations. The top Tory is said to have made securing their release and resolving the debt her top priorities when she took over as Foreign Secretary in September. After meeting all the families, she held talks with her Iranian counterpart in New York and tasked officials to hold talks in Tehran over October and November.  Omani ministers acted as mediators to help free the prisoners, with Ms Truss meeting the Omani Foreign Minister at Chevening in December. Negotiators travelled out to Omanaposs capital Muscat, last month to finalise the terms of their release. Ms Truss spoke twice to Iranian Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian in a final push to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion Talks have been ongoing for some time over the fate of the Brits in Iran but it is understood that the repayment of the debt got the deal over the line. However Mr Tabaz is still being kept in Iran on furlough from prison and there are other dual nationals who have not been freed.

He stood up just after pm on Monday to speak in the catchily-titled Genetically Modied OrganismsRegulations . But Tory whip Baroness Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist claimed he had been snoozing earlier on - and had to be woken by a member of Lords staff.It was not the first time someone has been accused of being asleep in Parliament, and previously some of those accused have insisted they were awake. MPs with hearing problems, for example, have been seen listening to speakers that are embedded in seats, while shutting their eyes to concentrate. Today, -year-old Lord Young, who has hearing dficulties, said that was exactly the case in his situation.  He slammed the “appalling and discourteous” behaviour of the whip who “discourteously dismissed” him. Standing up today to “set the record straight”, he told the Lords: “That wasn’t true. In fact what I was doing was listening as we do with my ear against the speaker. “Today my hearing aid batteries are now in and I’m not reliant on that.” He added: “Not only did it give some damage to my reputation, hopefully passing, but also in my view damaged the reputation of the House, unnecessarily in my view. “I received what purported to be a letter of apology from Baroness Bloomfield and it started with the line ‘Whatever the rights or wrongs’. “It seemed to me that wasn’t really an apology - that was more, shall we say, an equivocation at its best and I don’t accept that was an apology”. He added “we should set the record straight in this house” and “she should be here to hear that, and in my view to have apologised to the House.” After the accusation, the former postal workers’ union leader protested he was “not now” asleep, according to PA. According to Hansard, he protested: “I was not…”. Baroness Bloomfield had claimed: I am sorry, but the noble lord was fast asleep for the entire duration of the ministeraposs speech.” The Draft Genetically Modied OrganismsRegulations  debated by peers would allow the UK to deviate from EU law on genetic modication of crops. The regulations would allow greater freedom for the practice of gene editing of plants in the UK. Environment minister Lord Benyon said the regulations would allow the UK to remain at the forefront of research into GM crops.

Energy bills, National Insurance and inflation are all surging in April, outstripping benefit, pension and wage rises. Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a squeeze on the cost of living. The Ukraine-Russia war will make inflation worse - and in a bombshell development, the Mirror understands Whitehall officials are braced for it to go higher than %. The SNP called for an emergency package of support while Labour demanded a windfall tax on oil giants. Boris Johnson said: “We’re taking steps to mitigate that to help people with the cost of living.” Yet Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to be strongly resisting bids to cut fuel duty, give more help for bills, or raise benefits or pensions by the same amount as inflation.So when and what is the Spring Statement, and what do we know about how it’s shaping up  Here’s what you need to know. When is the Spring Statement  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the  Spring Statement on Wednesday  March at .pm. He will give a speech in the Commons, followed by documents and forecasts published online. After complaints from the Speaker, less of his statement is expected to be ‘trailed’ in advance. But the Chancellor is set to appear on Sunday morning TV this weekend to give a preview. What is the Spring Statement The Spring Statement is a ‘mini-Budget’ by the Chancellor on the situation facing the economy.It is lower-key than a Budget and does not contain the same tax and spending powers.For instance, fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol were already set for the year in October’s Budget. So was the minimum wage rise from £. to £. in April - though you can expect Mr Sunak to crow about it anyway.What will Chancellor Rishi Sunak announce during the Spring Statement The Chancellor is expected to lay out the sheer scale of the cost-of-living disaster hitting poor Brits. This will be in the form of Office for Budget Responsibilityforecasts on GDP growth, borrowing, debt and inflation. They will also have the warm-up acts of the Bank of England’s interest rates decision tomorrow, and monthly inflation figures for February - which will be published at am on the day of the Spring Statement. While growth is rising post-Covid, so is inflation - and it is set to be much worse than the last forecast . All this will ramp up pressure to announce extra help for households - but he’s reluctant to do that. Soaring inflation looks set to push up his borrowing bill, reducing the amount he claims he can spend. He could recycle already-announced policies or announce vague ‘consultations’ on future ones, but will it be enough  UK inflation could rise over % Shock analysis last week found inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Ukraine invasion made it even worse.The Mirror understands Whitehall officials believe this figure, calculated by the Resolution Foundation, is broadly accurate. Officials in fact fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of  and even hitting %. This will blow October’s forecasts - that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .% - out of the water. It will mean more expensive food and goods in the shops, hitting the poorest families hardest.Will there be help with energy bills Rishi Sunak is reluctant to offer extra help on energy bills - despite soaring prices and mounting pressure from MPs and charities. Previously he announced a £ council tax discount for Bands A-D next month, and a £ repayable rebate in October. Yet bills are rising by £ a year on April  and will rise again in October - possibly by another £, a year. This is a far bigger hit to the poorest tenth of households who spend around % of their income on energy. The richest spend %. Treasury officials want to wait until the run-up to the October rise before announcing more help. But a former Treasury minister told the Mirror that approach is “not going to work”, adding: “He’s going to have to do something, it just can’t be the full Covid.” Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, speculated that ministers might raise the £ repayable bills discount in October, or put back the start of repayments, currently April .But Mr Sunak has rejected Labour’s calls to cut VAT on energy bills or impose a windfall tax. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: Millions of people are worried sick about soaring bills. Meanwhile, BP have said theyaposve got more cash than they know what to do with, and have compared their record profits from inflated prices to a cash machine.” A long-term energy supply planBoris Johnson will set out a long-term energy supply plan for the UK to wean off Russian oilby the end of the year. This is expected to invest more in renewable power and nuclear power, as well as trying to get more oil from places like Saudi. But it’s not directly connected to the Spring Statement and could be published on a dferent day next week.Will benefits and pensions rise in April Despite gloom-laden inflation predictions, Mr Sunak will raise benefits by just .% - as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October he cut Universal Credit for millions by £ a week. Pensions will also rise by just .% after the triple lock was axed. These are both real-terms cuts that will leave the poorest struggling more.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, he handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p. But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work.The Resolution Foundation is worried there will be a “rollercoaster” with real benefits down this year and up next year. Tory MP Nigel Mills suggested bringing forward next yearaposs increase in Universal Credit to this autumn to solve the problem. The Mirror understands Mr Sunak is unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does. Will there be a pay rise for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers from April  Inflation means planned rises to public sector wages - due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But the Treasury is resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  .Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike.Pressure on the Chancellor to reverse this will be huge but again, it will take a lot for him to budge. Will fuel duty be cut Fuel duty was already frozen at October’s Budget for a th year in a row - handing £, to the average car driver since . Despite environmental fears, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is being pressed to go even further and actually cut it. One idea from a Tory MP is to give a % cut to vital fuel users, such as haulage firms. But it’s understood the Chancellor resists this idea, because it would not make a huge dference to the overall cost of a tank. Not compared to the huge rises coming from inflation and the war in Ukraine, anyway. Will alcohol prices rise and when  The cost of beer and sparking wine will fall, but whisky and vodka prices will rise, according to changes already announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak in his October Budget. Currently there is a complicated system of  separate tax bands for booze, across four main areas: beer, cider, spirits and wine. But the chancellor will do away with the old system and bring in a new one from February next year. This means tax cuts on drinks like normal-strength beer, wine, cider and liqueurs, but tax hikes on spirits like whisky. Sparkling wine costs will fall by around p a bottle.Will National Insurance and other tax rises be cancelled National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April . Tory MPs are still pushing for this to be cancelled as it’s a major tax rise just as a cost-of-living crisis hits. Downing Street say the rise is going ahead, despite previous claims Boris Johnson was wobbling. But some Tories still hold out hope. One said: “If itaposs about pride, they can now say that Ukraine is the reason they need to change course. Meanwhile more than  MPs have backed a bid from left-wing MP Richard Burgon to replace the hike with a wealth tax on the richest %. He says the same amount of income could be raised with a .% tax on wealth above £m. There are other tax squeezes - the Income Tax personal allowance and p rate threshold will freeze at £, and £,. The IFS think tank warns the threshold freezes will lead to more than £bn in ‘stealth’ taxes as inflation soars - and by , % of GDP will have been added to the UK tax burden. Meanwhile the VAT rate for hospitality firms, currently .% due to Covid, is due toto %. There are spaces here for the Chancellor to act but it would scupper his claims to be recovering from Covid.A vision beyond Covid and the war The Chancellor will likely try to set out a world beyond Covid but the Ukraine war and soaring inflation will make this dficult. Expect many references to infrastructure and ‘levelling-up’ but be on the lookout for old pots of money being reannounced. One Tory admitted to the Mirror: “The Rachel Reeves line that weaposre a high tax, low growth Government is true at the moment. “We donapost seem to have many pro-growth policies, weaposve pretty much given up on supply-side reforms.

Days later, he oversaw the largest mass execution in the country’s history. He is betting countries like the UK will look away, because they would rather fund his blood-soaked petro-state than Putin’s war machine. It is not an either or. There are better and more sustainable ways to deal with the energy crisis than empowering these regimes. By visiting Saudi Arabia, Johnson will confirm that the Kingdom will face no meaningful consequences for this mass execution. It virtually guarantees more people whose only crime was to protest against Bin Salman’s rule will be executed. People like Hassan al Maliki, an academic currently facing a death sentence for owning banned books.  The  executions at the weekend were probably beheadings, but Saudi ‘justice’ is such a black box we can’t be sure. The European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, which tracks death sentences in Saudi Arabia, didn’t even know about  of the cases. These men were tried, convicted, sentenced and executed in complete secrecy.Of the  we do know about, at least three were tortured into making  confessions to terrorism offences after taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Aqil al-Faraj was held in solitary confinement, beaten all over his body and tortured with electricity and cigarette burns. He was imprisoned for five years, without access to a lawyer, before trial. This is the reality of Saudi capital punishment. The authorities label executed men ‘terrorists’ but there are political prisoners, non-violent drug offenders, and people arrested as children on death row. In , the UK and Saudi governments signed a top secret ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ on judicial co-operation. Since this agreement has been in place, the Saudi regime led by King Salman and his son has dramatically increased the pace of executions – there have been more than  in all. Ministers claim the UK is a restraining influence, but the Saudis don’t seem to have noticed.Visiting Riyadh so soon after this mass execution shames the Prime Minister and shames Britain. We must not show our revulsion for Vladimir Putin’s atrocities by rewarding those of Mohammed Bin Salman.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON King SalmanBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTerrorismHuman rightsPoliticsRussia Ukraine warDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lauren McKeaney, , from Chicago in the US, suffers from dermatillomania - a psychological condition that is considered to be a type of OCD. It causes people to pick at, squeeze and even bite their own skin. People who suffer from it are often left with lesions all over their body, The Sun reports. In Laurenaposs case, the condition led to her cuts getting infected - which caused her to develop the deadly MRSA bug on her inner thigh. She said: “My right leg was just so swollen and infected, and the doctors had to come and talk to me about potentially losing my leg. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here“I felt the lowest I had felt but it was there that I actually heard someone say, ‘it looks like she has dermatillomania ’.”Until then, Lauren claims she had no idea what caused her to pick at her skin from he age of five - and she didnapost realise it was a real condition. After having eight inches of her thigh removed and extensive physiotherapy, Lauren made a full recovery from the bug. But despite physically recovering, Lauren has had to live with the psychological scars of the condition her entire le. She recalls realising she was the only kid at school with polka dot skin as a child, and bullies cruelly labelled her a leper.  As she reached puberty and began to suffer with acne, the stress triggered her condition and made it worse. Lauren, who had loved figure skating as a teen, even gave up her favourite hobby as she couldnapost pull off her tights without ripping scabs with them. While going through secondary school, Lauren claims one of the nurses even reported her for self-harming. When she reached university, the counsellors thought she was using crystal meth. Even though she was terried sheaposd lose her leg after contracting MRSA in , Lauren was relieved to have a diagnosis for her condition. While thereaposs no cure for it, she now finds ways to distract herself from the compulsion to pick at her skin. Lauren uses things like fidget spinners to keep her restless fingers busy, meaning she doesnapost feel the need to tear her skin apart. She says half the battle is knowing where your hands are so you can stop yourself from picking without realising it. Since her diagnosis, she has set up the Picking Me Foundation, to help other people with dermatillomania. She writes of the Foundation: “We aim to change the connotation of the word ‘pick’ to help patients and parents understand these behaviours are not their fault and to educate the medical world on the dire advocacy this skin picking disorder needs as it affects three per cent of the global population.”Do you suffer from dermatillomania  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON OCD\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mum Kat Milner, , weighed  stone when she attended her dad Andrewaposs funeral in December  - and when she couldnapost find a suitable dress for the occasion she had a wake-up call. Kat said: “I was  stone and had struggled to find a black dress for my dad’s funeral. “He had passed away suddenly. His funeral was the first time I had seen some of my family for a while and I just felt embarrassed by my size.” The mum-of-three says she was always a bigger size, even as a child, and was like a little pudding at school - which she puts down to her dad being a chef. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here And while she was eating chocolate for breakfast and freezer food for dinner, her size crept up over the years. After giving birth to her youngest daughter Margeaux in March , Kat says her weight had ballooned without her realising.“I don’t know how much weight I’d put on during the pregnancy because I was already so big. Probably a stone, so when I went back to work, I was struggling to manage everything, Kat, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, said.“Even walking up the stairs or taking my baby out in the buggy left me feeling breathless and balancing healthy eating with motherhood and work just felt impossible.” Kat, who is also mum to -year-old Gabrielle and six-year-old Cagney, decided to try out a diet sheaposd done once before - : Diet by Cambridge Weight Plan.  The diet, which supplies you with all your meals, had worked for Kat in the past. But sheaposd ended up putting the weight back on. “I’d tried everything over the years including the cabbage soup diet and the Special K diet, but when you are just eating the same mundane food every day, it’s just too hard to stick to for more than a few days, she said. Kat, who also lives with husband Ben, , started following the plan in March  - eating low calorie meals from the plan and consuming  calories a day. At first, she didnapost do any exercise because her meals were already putting her in a calorie deficit - meaning it wasnapost long before she started seeing results.Watching the weight fall off her, Kat says she ditched her baggy T-shirts and stretchy leggings and marched into New Look to buy a new pair of jeans. Now weighing  stone and fitting into size - clothes, Kat is still on the plan, but sheaposs eating a much more sustainable  calories a day - the recommended daily intake for women. “There’s no black left in my wardrobe now. My favourite colour is orange, so I chopped off my long, blonde hair when Iaposd lost st and dyed it orange, too, she said. But the biggest change, thanks to my weight loss, has not been to my appearance, itaposs been to my mental health. I just feel so happy now. ‘’I feel a million times better about myself and just want to say ‘yes’ to every opportunity le throws at me. Since losing the weight herself, Kat has now trained to become a consultant for the : Diet. She said: “I have my very own slimmers now and I love to see how, once they start to lose the weight, they get themselves back. “The most important thing I tell them is that losing weight starts with one step and to focus on that step instead of thinking about the whole staircase.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mental healthFitnessWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Carmen Cole said: “Jay is such a little character and while he may be small, he certainly makes up for that in personality. “He was well looked after in his previous home and was much-loved. Sadly, however, he’s suffered from severe allergies his whole le - a common problem for Westies - and he’s now almost completely bald. to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  “We worry that this is what’s putting potential adopters off of offering him a new home but we really hope that there’ll be someone out there who can look past his lack of hair and see that he has a whole lot of love to give.”Due to Jay’s health problems he has a specialist diet and will need ongoing veterinary care and medication in his new home.He has eye drops for dry eye, cream and coconut oil to massage into his skin daily, special medication and medicated baths for his allergies, ear cleaner and steroids for le to manage his ear infections. Carmen added: “Poor Jay does have a lot of health problems which are sadly common for his breed. As he’s aged, some of these problems have flared up and we recently had to put his home search on hold due to recurring ear infections.”The West Highland terrier is also losing his sight so will need owners who will be understanding and supportive of this as he ages. He’s been in a foster home and is doing well but the team is desperate to find him a permanent home. Carmen said: “Jay is such a sweet boy he’s a real softie and although he’s quirky and knows his own mind, he has us in stitches all the time! He can be really playful and can sometimes be timid so he needs an owner who will understand his moods!”Ideally, the RSPCA is seeking an experienced home for Jay. Staff would like potential adopters to visit him several times before taking him home so they can learn how to administer his medication and so he can learn to trust them.He’s looking for an adult-only home where he’ll be the only pet and would like a secure garden to potter in. Dust mites can cause his allergies to flare up so he’s best in a home with hard floors as opposed to carpets. Jay can be left home alone for short periods of time but would like someone who is around for most of the day as he needs regular visits to the garden. He does struggle around other dogs so his new owners will need to help manage this. Carmen added: “We know it is going to be a struggle to find a home that will tick all of Jay’s boxes and we understand that the cost of his ongoing care may be putting people off. “But we won’t give up on Jay he is a spicy character, who is a cheeky chappie with heaps of charm and who has expensive taste – but being this cute doesn’t come cheap! It takes a lot of work to look as good as he does – he deserves the very best. “He’s quite chatty and can be loud sometimes as he likes to demand your attention. He’s a real softie with his own quirks and that’s what makes him so charming and lovable. “He is an absolute sweetheart and will make such a wonderful pet or companion for the right person.”Find out more about Jay from his online profile or contact the branch rehoming coordinator on rehoming@rspca-macclesfield.org.uk or  .Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Leah and Andrew Taylor Jones from Runcorn, Cheshire, had both been members of the same gym, and had even attended a gymnastics competition together before fate brought them together.The couple who’d had several near misses only realised they were truly destined to be when they hit it off at the inclusive Ella Performance Group in . After tying the knot at a beautul Alice in Wonderland tea-party themed wedding in June last year, the pair have shared their love story to remind everyone that their special someone is “just around the corner”. Leah, , told The Mirror: “When I was younger I was a bit shy, but I had a dream to have the perfect big day to show how much I loved somebody in front of our families.“When I met Andrew, I knew I liked him straight away, I said to one of my friends that he was a hottie and he was the one for me. “The first time he asked me out I said no because I needed a chance to think about it but then when he asked me again I said yes.  “The first time he asked me out I said no because I needed a chance to think about it but then when he asked me again I said yes. “It’s the best feeling in the world meeting the love of your le, he’s my best friend and I want to grow old with him.” Andrew, , who works as a store assistant at Asda, proposed to Leah on his th birthday at a local restaurant with a prosecco toast. He said: “I had been single for nine years and I was hoping that I would meet that special someone to settle down and spend the rest of my le with.  “As soon as I saw her I knew that she was the one. “It was fate, I think we were destined to be with each other. “I could tell I had almost let her get away from those near misses and I knew I had to reel her in.” After struggling with her self esteem and confidence in her younger years, Leah, with the help of her PA, decided to set up an arts programme for people with disabilities to feel more confident. She now runs the non-profit company, Positive You, which supports people across the UK. Before finally meeting Andrew at a lucky encounter, Leah had even considered applying for Channel  ’s Undateables, a programme which helps to match those who feel unlucky in love.Leah’s mum, Sue said: “Leah had always wanted to find that someone special even going as far as looking at contacting The Undateables and then Andrew just walked into the group that night. “From the moment Leah was born her dad and I took the attitude that she would have access to everything her brothers had so having a relationship was exactly what we always wanted for her because she wanted it for herself.  “I had listened to Leah longing for a relationship for some time. There were a couple along the way but they didn’t work out. “We always had a little saying and I would tell her “he’s just around the corner”. “When Leah and Andrew met it was brilliant because they got on so well.” Although the couple were forced to postpone their nuptials a number of times due to Covid, they finally celebrated the big day with  guests at All Saints Church in Daresbury, the hometown of Lewis Carroll.  Music played a big part too, with Andrew recording a version of his favourite song, Beautul In White by Westle, which was played as they left the church, while Leah walked down the aisle to A Thousand Years by Christina Perri. This year, the couple plan to celebrate their full wedding reception with over  guests, inviting everyone who was previously unable to make the big day due to Covid restrictions.  Now the newlyweds are sharing their incredible love story to show other hopeful romantics that the right person is out there for everyone.

While the lucky sellers have not been named, itaposs been said the owners are a British couple who brought the marble of an idealised, penitent Mary Magdalene to decorate their garden.When suspicions arose that their sculpture could be the long-lost Canova, the owners contacted the art adviser Francis Outred,The Financial Times reports.Outred’s team, led by Alice Whitehead, unearthed much of its missing history. The piece titled “Maddalena Giacente ”, hailing from -, will be put up for sale by Christie’s in London on July .

Donald Johnston, head of Christie’s sculpture department, said the story behind the sculpture was “amazing”. “I’ve seen little bronzes on tabletops that have been overlooked but not something of this scale or calibre with this history,” he said. The sculpture is missing a crucix that leaned on the Magdelene’s shoulder, but Outred says the work was otherwise in very good shape with some “sensitive restoration”.

Daniella Gallagher,  has said her daughter Leyla is big and bold and should not be hindered by the conditions that affect her.Leyla has autism, ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidancewhich makes social interactions and everyday expectations dficult for her. She has been out of school since June , with local mainstream schools in Leeds finding it dficult to place her, Leeds Live reports. Daniella said : Itaposs been hell for Leyla. Sheaposs socially isolated.A lot of Autistic people have special interests - Leylaaposs special interest is people.Sheaposs desperate for friendships. Sheaposs a -year-old girl that is full of le, energy. Sheaposs big and bold, has a great sense of humour, and is a fantastic character. Sheaposs desperate for friends but she canapost maintain friendships well because sheaposs not in a school environment where she can meet and see friends regularly. Leyla is of an age now where sheaposs aware sheaposs dferent and obviously that has a huge impact on her and her self-esteem. She hasnapost identied how she fits in yet and who she is as a person and tried to copy other people. Itaposs such a dficult time for her and she isnapost in a school environment where she can work out who she is. Leyla was previously in mainstream education but began to struggle from around year one onwards. In , she was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and Daniella started looking at alternative provisions Leyla could attend. She found her a place at a partnership school with an attached provision to start in January . In December , Leyla had PDA traits added to her diagnosis by CAMHS.Leylaaposs time at the alternative provision started off well, but she was affected by lockdowns, and quickly became anxious as before. In June , the school admitted it couldnapost meet her needs. Daniella said: Mainstream schools just looked at her as aposthat naughty childapos. While she was in mainstream schooling she was locked in classrooms when she was having meltdowns before she was diagnosed, Daniella said. She was running out of school with no shoes on onto main roads when she just seven years old. Getting her into school was a nightmare. The anxiety was so high, Iaposd have to peel her off railings. If I was successful Iaposd get a phone call within half an hour that sheaposd run out or had a meltdown. Even once she joined her new specialist provision in , her anxiety got to the point of being through the roof - at that point, it was just impossible. She was trying to escape and abscond all the time. Since then, Leyla has been at home and out of full-time education while Daniella has desperately been trying to find somewhere that can accommodate Leyla. In the time since the summer, both Leeds City Council and Daniella have been contacting provisions across Leeds to seethey can fulfil her needs as per her Education, Health and Care Plan .EHCs set out the specic needs of children with special educational needs in order to provide the support those children need. But so far, every single provision has said no - Daniella estimates Leyla has been rejected by - schools in the local authority area. One primary school said it could potentially meet Leylaaposs needs - but it has no space until , by which point she will nearly have aged out of primary education. Daniella added: Leyla doesnapost get the chance to experience lots of dferent peer groups and social interactions. We try to do lots of dferent activities, climbing, swimming, and more but she ends up stuck with me all the time. Sheaposs run away before, sheaposs been bullied, sheaposs been hit by people claiming to be her friends, she gets horrible messages. Sheaposs quite an intense person who doesnapost really understand social boundaries all the time and that can make her very vulnerable for being bullied. Itaposs really hard for her. According to Daniella, the reason Leyla has been refused many alternative provisions is that she is often too academic to fit in with the peer groups. Daniella also said she has had a nightmare trying to get hold of someone to speak to at the local authority since autumn  to discuss suitable schools. She has since made an official complaint. The school Leyla was at until June  have helped sort out a six to -week placement at a provision at another school in the area.But the provision isnapost permanent as a solution. Itaposs heartbreaking for me. Sheaposs my baby and I want her to be happy. I know she will be amazing at whatever she does when she finds herself, Daniella said. Sheaposs a very strong, resilient, creative young girl and sheaposs going to do amazing. Leyla changes and educates people all around her because sheaposs that type of character. She will do amazing once she finds the place she fits in. Itaposs hard to watch your child struggle so much. The gaps in her learning are just growing and growing and thataposs becoming more apparent as she gets older. I do worry about her future but I will help her do whatever she needs to do to get her GCSEs, whether she wants to do them later in le. My expectations for her currently are more around focusing on her social and emotional wellbeing. She added she was saddened by the fact that there are no options for children like her daughter. Daniella said: I canapost make a school happen by clicking my fingers - there just seems to be nowhere out there for children like Leyla with PDA. Thereaposs very little knowledge in this area around the condition. Weaposre lucky to have really good support groups in the area as thereaposs also very little official support. Iaposm a single mum with two kids and they take up every second of my le. That can impact my own mental health - itaposs not easy. I used to work at a school but I had to leave my job because of all this. You donapost realise until youaposre in this situation how dire it is. Even just trying to get a bit of help and support from anybody is impossible. A Leeds City Council spokesperson said: “Whilst we are not able to comment on inidual cases, the local authority is committed to work in partnership with parents and in the best interests of children. We strive to meet the provision needs of children with SEND and aspirations of parents and we take the concerns of parents seriously. “PDA is a clinical diagnosis and therefore we are led by our clinical partners in their use of diagnostic terminology. Our statutory processes, consultation with specialist and mainstream settings and provision offer is not restricted by a diagnostic framework. “We endeavour to work restoratively with all families to ensure children with SEND meet their aspirations and outcomes.

Everyone involved in the strip search of a -year-old black schoolgirl needs to be sacked – immediately.That includes politan Police officers who carried out this utterly inappropriate act, and the staff at the school who called them in the first place and allowed this to happen. None of them should be in a position of authority over anyone, let alone children, again. The child was suspected of carrying cannabis. Let’s be clear, she wasn’t seen smoking or even in possession of the drug. Her “crime”, as far as the school and the police were concerned, was to allegedly smell of it. And that was enough for the full force of the law to descend on her.  Instead of calling her parents or another appropriate adult, the staff rang the police. The child was taken to the medical room of the school in Hackney, East London, and stripped-searched by two female officers while the teachers waited outside. The details of the intimate search are too graphic to go into. The girl was on her period and during the ordeal she was forced to take off her sanitary pad as officers searched for drugs. They didn’t find any. A child safeguarding review concluded this week the incident was unjustied and racism was “likely” to have been a factor. The review found it was highly likely there was “adultication bias”, where adults see black children as being older than they are and don’t treat them in age-appropriate ways. As a mother, and a mother of black children, it breaks my heart to think what this poor young girl went through. You’d think this type of treatment is reserved for terrorist suspects or highly dangerous criminals, not a child at school. She was treated this way because she is black. Her parents have spoken of the profound impact this ordeal has had on their daughter. She went from being “happy-go-lucky to a timid recluse”. Time and time again we see public authorities fail black children. And then they wonder why black communities have so little faith in them. The police have apologised. Standard procedure which means nothing. And the incident is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. What we really need is action, to see heads roll and compensation for the girl and her family. I hope the young victim is getting all the support and care she needs to heal and live le to the full.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyhas approved Evusheld, made by AstraZeneca, as the UK’s first drug which includes protective antibodies developed in a lab. The treatment could be lesaving for some of the half a million immunocompromised Brits who cannot get protection from Covid vaccines, such as cancer patients and organ donor recipients. Many have continued to shield themselves from social contact despite the lting of all pandemic restrictions.MHRA chief Dr June Raine said: “While the Covid- vaccines continue to be the first-line defence against Covid-, we know that some people may not respond adequately to these vaccines.” Vaccines rely on a ing immune system and trigger it to produce protective antibodies against the virus. Some % of immunocompromised people mount a low or undetectable immune response.It comes as new data shows the ‘Stealth Omicron ’ BA. sub-iant now makes up % of UK cases and infections increase.For some patients such as those with leukaemia BA. represents a % risk of deaththey catch the virus. Other patients who do not mount a proper immune response to vaccination include some with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.Evusheld, which is administered in two consecutive injections, appears to offer protection for six months. Trials showed it to be % effective in preventing serious illness and death from Covid-.It was found to cut the risk of developing symptomatic Covid by %. People with blood cancer comprise about , of the , severely immunocompromised people in the UK. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: “The high infection rate has meant many blood cancer patients have felt left behind as the rest of society gets back to normal. “Evusheld offers them hope of getting a similar level of protection against Covid as most of the population have already got from the vaccines.  “Many people with blood cancer have now spent almost two years avoiding social interaction.The Government needs to do more to support them to be able to start getting back to normal.” Evusheld is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies, tixagevimab and cilgavimab. It is under a European review and has been authorised in the US. Despite the MHRA ruling it safe and effective Britain and AstraZeneca currently do not have an agreement for the supply of the drug.for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information at www.mirror email.AstraZeneca in a statement said it hopes to see the injections made available on the NHS “as quickly as possible”.UK president Tom Keith-Roach said: “Evusheld fills an urgent gap in the UK’s fight against Covid-, providing protection for people for whom vaccination may not be effective and who are often amongst the most clinically vulnerable in society. “We hope to see this critical medicine made available to UK patients as quickly as possible, in line with other countries.” Prof Alex Richter, a member of the British Society for Immunology Covid- Taskforce, said: “I am delighted that the Evusheld Covid monoclonal antibody has been approved by the MHRA. “We hope this translates quickly into clinical use within the NHS. “The safety and effectiveness of Evusheld have been assessed through several clinical trials and it is already in use as an approved therapy in several other countries. “There are many patients with immunodeficiency who have not responded to vaccination and so remain vulnerable to Covid. Using monoclonal antibodies as a preventative treatment will give a lot of hope to these patients as the country opens up from Covid and infection rates are still so high.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AstraZeneca plcThe MedicinesNHSImmune systemMultiple sclerosisOrgan donationTherapyArthritisLeukaemia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But by simply switching off the engine while waiting in queues motorists could save hundreds of pounds, reported BirminghamLive. Motoring experts have said that cutting the engine while stationary could mean drivers end up spending £ less on petrol per year - and it is recommended by the Highway Code. By using this simple trick where the ignition is switched off as well, motorists will also be doing less damage to the environment.  The advice comes as drivers continue to be clobbered by record fuel prices as petrol reaches an average of £. per litre. MotorEasy founder and CEO Duncan McClure Fisher said: “One thing many people do that is entirely unnecessary is to leave their engine idling. This can be done first thing in the morning to ‘warm it up’ or when stuck in traffic. Even dropping off something at a friend’s house can see people leave the motor running instead of turning off the ignition. “While this might seem very innocent, research has shown an idling engine can burn through three to four pence of fuel a minute.  If you are doing  minutes of warming up, five days a week, and spending another  minutes per week stuck in traffic – that adds up to a very handy £ a year that’s being wasted.” Figures from data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts has increased by  pence in the past month. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: With the spring statement just a week away, drivers will be looking to the chancellor to end their misery by cutting duty or VAT. One thingaposs for sure: simply reiterating that fuel duty has been frozen at  pence a litre simply isnapost going to cut it.

Megan Ripley, , and Louise Jackson, , struck up a platonic friendship at the nursery where she worked last year in July. Megan, who is a mum-of-one, introduced Louise to her husband of six years, -year-old Sean, and they also hit it off. And before they knew it, two became three. Megan, from Market Weighton, York, said she had “never heard” of a throuple before. “I didn’t even know it was possible to be in love with two people at once,” she said.  “But when I met Louise it all changed, we instantly had a spark. “However I didn’t say anything as I didn’t want to ruin our friendship as we had become best friends.“Eventually I introduced her to Sean following a night out, and they got on like a house on fire too.”Megan couldn’t fight her feelings anymore and told Sean how she felt. To her surprise, he confessed having feelings for Louise too. She adds: “We never thought we would introduce someone into our relationship. “But it just made sense with Louise so we were elated when she said she feels the same.”  Now one year on, Louise is called ‘mum’ by the couple’s son William, three. Megan adds: “Our relationship has moved fast but we are also taking it slow. “Louise stays at ours for one week and at her parents the other. “Eventually, she will move in though and perhaps have a child with Sean. “At the start, I was against this idea but now I would be honouredshe wanted to extend our family with my husband.” The trio tend to share a super king bed and go on dates as a threesome. Megan adds: “We go on one to one dates or all together, it depends how we feel and try keep it fair to eradicate jealousy. “We do get jealous sometimes but we are only human. “To try and prevent jealousy, we always make sure we tell each otherthings are turning sexual. “For example,I am at work and they are at home, they will text me to let me know things are going that way. “So then at least I know they are thinking about me. “It doesn’t kill the moment, it makes it more special. “We also have to be open to hearing about jealousy and speaking about it.” Megan praises family and friends for being supportive. She adds: “We have only received positive comments. “People are happy as we are happy. “It’s great because Louise shares interests that I don’t have with Sean and vice versa. “Sometimes, we may get the odd stare when we are in public and all holding hands but most of the time it is fine.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveMarriage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is hard to comprehend the torment she has endured since she was arrested on trumped-up charges by the Iranian authorities. Twice she went on hunger strike. Her health suffered. She lost two appeals and had her sentenced increased. Many would have been broken by this adversity but Nazanin’s spirit never faltered. It was matched only by the love, tenacity and dedication of her husband Richard who campaigned tirelessly for her release. They did not deserve to be the pawns in a diplomatic power game between London and Tehran. Nor did they deserve to be let down by Boris Johnson whose blundering prompted Iran to level fresh charges against her. This story was not destined to have a happy ending. The fact that it does is a testament to their resilience and devotion to each other.  No more delays Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion has created the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Almost three million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes as they seek sanctuary from the Russian bombardment. That number is set to rise as more people flee the besieged cities in Eastern Ukraine. They are in desperate need of food, clothes and a place to live. The tens of thousands of people who have signed up to the Homes for Ukraine scheme shows that households across Britain are ready to help. The only thing standing in their way is the Government’s delay in carrying out checks. Now is the time for compassion, not cold-hearted box ticking and foot dragging.

It doesnapost affect his visibility and makes him stand out from the rest of the pack - but his shy personality has meant heaposs struggled to find a family.Theros was picked up off the streets of Greece by Wild At Heart Foundation last June and the charity have been searching for a perfect match ever since.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Jenni Musson at Wild At Heart Foundation said: Theros, with his striking good looks and charm, attracted lots of interest when he was a tiny puppy, but since he has grown in size, his applications have plummeted. He turns one next month and it would be amazinghe could celebrate it in his forever home. Theros needs a rural setting in a quiet home and a canine friend... but otherwise, he really doesnapost ask for much more. In September , Theros was adopted to a UK home, but found moving countries and the sudden change in environments scary, which meant he couldnapost settle in properly. The tough decision was made to rehome him and Theros is now safely living in a foster home in York with other dogs, cats and a nine-year-old boy - who is very much his favourite human to date.  Therosapos personality wins lots of people over and his stunning eyes attract lots of attention. However, he is nervous by nature and his future family will need to understand this, and give him the time, patience, love and protection he needs from things he fears. Theros is looking for a home that can offer him a stable and quiet routine in a rural setting with a large, secure garden. He may not be a dog that would settle in a busy household, or join you at the pub, but he does show loyalty and would make the most wonderful addition to a family. Wild At Heart Foundation are hoping to find him a home with existing pet dogs, and he could live alongside cats.If you are interested in adopting Theros, please visit his profile and get in touch with Wild At Heart Foundation.

A large high pressure system will bring the soaring temperatures on Friday but before that people are likely to wake up to frosty start on Thursday.The weather for the rest of March remains changeable with the UK set to see the highest temperatures of the year so far with it reaching C on Friday but there is then an unsettled outlook for next week. Going into Thursday, BBC weather said that it could get as low as -C in Scotland and it will be chilly with wind and rain for much of the day in the north while further south there will be warmer weather and sunshine.Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “For the Western Isles and Northern Ireland the clouds will thicken here with some showery bursts of rain through the early hours of the morning and a strengthening wind. Elsewhere a fairly widespread frost leading to a cold start to the day come Thursday morning but for many it will be bright with some sunshine. It is not the case across western Scotland, you can see some heavy bursts of rain, snow above m or m. That rain extends down towards Northern Ireland. Ms Nasir said it is likely to be very warm over the weekend. Temperatures are on the up over the next few days you can see here most places will be fine and dry with some lovely sunshine, she continued. Into the weekend high pressure reaching across Denmark will allow for settled conditions to extend right across the UK, but some stronger winds on Saturday certainly, gusts over the hills and moors as well as the mountains but with a southerly wind it will feel very warm across some parts particularly I would say the Moray Firth where we could see an C.  Generally the weekend is looking fine and dry, much warmer with some sunshine. The Met Office has said that the hottest day so far in  was .C in Pershore, Worcestershire. And forecaster Dan Stroud agreed that it could get warmer than that over the coming days.We are likely to see some very pleasant spring sunshine, especially for the London and southeast area, during the course of the Saturday, he said, reported The Sun.Weaposre looking at temperatures of up to , , and perhaps even a rounded C could be possible. UK forecast for the next  days Mainly dry in the south and east, unsettled where. Today: Sunny spells for many, especially in the south and east with southern England seeing the best of the sunshine. Also some showery rain over parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, northwest England and, later, Wales. Windy in the north. Tonight: Rather cloudy across parts of England and Wales, with fog patches forming over parts of Wales and the Midlands in particular later. Clearer further north with some showers and frost. Friday: A chilly start with early fog patches over England and Wales soon clearing leaving a fine day with plenty of pleasantly warm sunshine for most.

The practice, which has been going on for more than  years, was started completely by accident. A former Chicago Mayor wanted to clean up the cityaposs riverfront area, to do this he got plumbers to use an orange dye into peopleaposs water systems. When the solution came into contact with sewage, it turned a bright green. The bright green wash gave one member of the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local union an idea. Today, the descendants of just two families from that plumbers union are still the ones responsible for dyeing the river each year.Typically the river is dyed every Saturday before St Patrickaposs Day, with this year thousands of braving the cold last weekend to celebrate and the green river, NPR reports.The families say they now use a more environmentally-friendly solution made from vegetables . However the actual recipe for the dye is a closely guarded secret. The dye is known by the two families as aposLeprechaun Dustapos and is orange before coming into contact with water.Margaret Frisbie, executive director of Friends of the Chicago River, has long campaigned to end the practice of dyeing the river. She argues that it perpetuates the idea that humans can do whatever they like to the environment. Frisbee told Euronews: Illinois EPA has never required a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systempermit so there is no way to know what the dye is or whether it is harmless. Imagine fish, beavers or otters swimming through that dyed-green water and you might think a new celebration is the right idea. While we donapost know the full impact of the dye on the ecosystems of the Chicago river, we do know that dyeing the river has encouraged copycats and not just in other cities.  Only a certain section of the Chicago river is allowed to be dyed each year.However illegal dyeing occurred in both  and , during the Covid- pandemic.The Chicago TV news station WTTW reports that police officers will be on the lookout for any illegal dyeing taking place this year.

Stephen took to TikTok to share his insight on what itaposs like working on buses, saying he was sick of people blaming him when things donapost go their way.He said there were rules he had to follow - and one in particular related to the doors, as Stephen said he wasnapost allowed to open them again once they had been closed. Stephen, who drives buses in Glasgow, Scotland, said that the bus operators face a finethey open the doors after aposservicingapos a stop, and he could get in big trouble with his employerhe reopened them. What do you think about Stephenaposs insight  Let us know in the comments... Stephen, who posts to TikTok as @fatbusdriver, said: Quite a lot of people don’t know this. In the town, we are under TRC conditions which means they’re enforced by Glasgow City Council, SPT and our own inspectors.As soon as we’ve serviced a stop and the doors close we cannot open them again. The company faces a fine and can have their bus license for that vehicle taken off which means it costs them money. And we can get into serious s**t for it into the bargain. It’s nothing to do with the drivers. If it’s in the town that’s what it is,it’s outside the town I can’t say.

Joey and Amy Radke, of Shakopee, Minnesota, believe the figure in their hallway to be the restless spirit of a former tenant who died in their home.After moving in two years ago, the pair chose to ignore warnings that the property was haunted by aposdemonic entitiesapos and had always felt quite comfortable - until last week when they looked at their CCTV.The pair set up CCTV cameras to check on their pets and the footage appears to show a aposspectral figure with bouffant hairapos clad in a nightgown.The video was taken in the hallway at night and Joey has likened it to disturbing scenes from the  horror movie, Paranormal Activity. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Joey, , says the landlord did warn he and we Amy that sheaposd previously sensed a presence in the house and that another tenant claimed to have felt aposdemonic entitiesapos watching her as she slept. The footage has prompted Joey to look through more footage and he has since pressed their neighbours for more information about the house. However, Amy, , has apparently been left so terried that she refuses to speak about what the footage shows. After investigating further, sales worker Joey believes the figure could be that of an elderly lady who passed away in the house years ago and was carried out by paramedics while still wearing her nightie. Joey believes that the footage shows proof of the afterle, describing the creepy clip as being the holy grail of ghost videos as he reckons it canapost possibly be faked.  Joey explained: The video is like something from Paranormal Activity. When I saw it, I just thought aposoh my Godapos. I was creeped out. We took it to my brother-in-lawaposs house to get it up on the TV and we could make out a woman with bouffant hair, like a beehive. We just gasped. It freaks my we out. She doesnapost want to talk about it. A woman died in our bedroom many years ago. The neighbours say she was taken out by paramedics in her nightgown and in the video, you can see the figure is wearing a nightie. The person weaposre renting from said they thought they felt a presence and the previous renter said they saw demonic entities, shadows, and something watching her while she was sleeping. Iaposm starting to notice things now because Iaposm more aware.  He continued: After the video, I have the feeling that Iaposm being watched. Iaposll be sat watching TV in the living room and the hallway is on my right and I can see something out of the corner of my eye but thereaposs nothing there. I feel like someone is standing there peeking their head around the corner. Itaposs real, thereaposs no two ways about it. You canapost fake that. It proves that there is an afterle. This video is the holy grail of ghost videos. I did believe in an afterle before but I like to physically see it. The footage in question was captured at approximately . pm and appears to show the figure walking out of Amyaposs office and into the hallway, prompting the coupleaposs cats - Tigger, Sophie, and Peanut - to hide beneath a coffee table. Joey himself can then be seen stepping out into the hallway to use the bathroom, walking through the exact same spot where the figure had been standing mere seconds before. Joey added: This is the first time Iaposve seen anything. We see it going from right to left. That room is my weaposs office and itaposs always cold. I was in there a couple of days ago and I could see my own breath but we have a furnace in the house and thick plastic on the windows and you can feel the temperature dference when you go out into the hallway. I definitely know my cats saw it because one goes under the glass coffee table and peeks out down the hallway looking directly at the figure. The figure is definitely levitating because itaposs taller than me. About  seconds after it disappeared, I come out to go to the restroom and walk right through where she was standing. I think itaposs cool because Iaposm more curious. I want to see it again so I can ask questions.Do you have a ghost-related story to share  We pay for stories.

We all know the story. Cinderella is treated horribly by her Wicked Stepmother, who favours her ugly stepsisters, and is forced to be their maid. One night, they all get invited to the ball, and of course, Cinderella is forbidden from going. The Fairy Godmother, however, has other ideas and decides she WILL go to the ball, before transforming her scruffy rags into a beautul gown. However, when the clock strikes midnight and Cinderella attempts to make a quick escape, she loses a glass slipper - which fans point out is a major plot hole. The discovery came after a film fan asked Reddit users: What’s the worst plot hole you’ve seen in a well-regarded movie  - and one person was quick to bring up one in Cinderella thataposs bugging them.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Cinderella, she is told by the fairy godmother that everything will turn back to what it originally was at midnight, they wrote. Her dress, carriage, and horses do so why don’t her glass slippers  But apparently, thereaposs a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, as someone replied explaining that Cinderella’s dress and her horse and carriage were transformed from items she already had. Whereas the slippers were made from magic itself and hadnapost been transformed, so couldnapost disappear. I believe the slipper was a surprise gt from the Fairy Godmother, explained a Reddit user. Cinderella realises it’s not gone in the morning as it should have been and gives an aposoh, thank youapos out to the universe for it, showing that she recognises that while the original deal was for midnight, the Fairy Godmother did something special allowing the shoe to be kept as a memento. Another plot hole that other Cinderella fans have pointed out are also glass slipper related. If you’re going to rip on Cinderella, you could at least bring up her slippers that fit like a dream and then suddenly fall off, one person wrote, which now come to think of makes a good point. But, thereaposs an answer for this too. Sheaposd been dancing all night. Glass slippers donapost ‘breathe’ so Iaposm pretty sure sweat had begun to pool in them and her feet were slick, one person theorised.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Luckily, Taryn Ross, talent acquisition manager at the recruiting firm Pivot + Edge, has some advice that will put you at the top of the candidate list.On the companyaposs TikTok account @pivotandedge , Taryn revealed the biggest mistake you could be making that could be unknowingly stopping you from landing your dream job.She says it all comes down to how you answer the age-old question - Whataposs your greatest weakness  First off she explains exactly how you should not respond. Taryn said that when youaposre asked what your greatest weakness is, you shouldnapost say you canapost think of anything or that you donapost have any weaknesses as this will have the interviewer immediately crossing your name off their list of prospective hires.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. She also said that although itaposs good to be honest, itaposs probably best not to say anything that would obviously jeopardise your chances of getting the job, like saying youaposre never on time . Taryn also said that you donapost want to say your biggest weakness is something completely unrelated to the job, like for example, revealing your love for fast food. Instead, you want to pick something that still paints you in a flattering light. Taryn gave these good examples: I sometimes have dficulty asking for help when needed.I like to get my work done quickly and efficiently but it is something I am actively working on. Another acceptable answer Taryn provided was: I often have a hard time saying no. Iaposm a team player and want to help out my colleagues to the best of my ability, but I need to stop overfilling my own plate. In the comment section, Taryn gave additional answers when asked about your weaknesses. If your weakness is confrontation, Taryn suggested saying: In the past I found myself compromising too much to avoid upsetting others, but I learned that it was more beneficial to everyone to offer constructive criticism when needed. Now, I practice being assertive and listening to all points of view so I can offer genuine solutions vs. temporary fixes. And for those who struggle with overthinking, she said: I tend to consider all perspectives and outcomes before making a decision, which can cause delays. I’ve learned to find a balance between positive results and efficiency because perfection isn’t always attainable. Now, I set limits and stay accountable to them so I don’t overthink.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Whether itaposs when we are out in public with Winston or people commenting on his photographs on social media, we always have people telling us that they are convinced Winston is a person and not a dog, Natasha said. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Natasha and her partner, Joe Holyhead, , brought Winston home as a puppy on Christmas Eve and set him up an Instagram account to document his doggy le.They never imagine it would lead to so many peculiar comments online. People canapost believe how much he looks like a human. Itaposs hilarious, Natasha said.

The way that Winston lays on the sofa is funny too because it just looks like a person is sitting on the couch with us.  Natasha was instantly drawn to Winstonaposs chocolate button nose and unique colouring, and says it makes him look more human because it almost gives him a bit more structure to his face. Cockapoo Winston enjoys all of the attention he gets when he is out and about, and has an ever-growing collection of clothing that makes him appear even less dog. When he is dressed in trendy human-like items of clothing, I think this also adds to him looking even more like a person, Natasha explained.We love to dress him in adorable outfits and he loves wearing them. It also means he gets even more attention when we are out on walks which is always a good thing for Winston. Winston has fleeces, hoodies, jumpers and harnesses which he loves to wear. His favourite thing to do is go on a woodland walk and play with other dogs. Winston is our son.

This means that when you get a message that is deleted later on, youaposll still be able to view it through your notication history. You can do this by opening the settings app again, heading to notications history and tapping aposrecently dismissedapos any time you want to see what has vanished.  Sadly, the trick doesnapost work on iPhone as it doesnapost have a notication log feature, but this might change in future. Deleting messages allows you to remove certain messages from inidual or group chats after youaposve sent them. You tap and hold a message then press delete. Doing so will replace the deleted message with a notication saying This message was deleted. You only have seven minutes to remove a message after sending it, so make sure you do it quickly.

However, there are plenty of treatments on the market that can help to get you long, strong locks, like supplements or shampoos. But one of the stranger tricks weaposve come across is fingernail rubbing.Helen Reavey, trichologist and hairstylist at Act + Acre, shared the hack on her TikTok @helenreaveywhere she regularly shares hair tips and tutorials.In a video that has had , views, she said the secret to growing long healthy hair is fingernail rubbing - and yes we know it sounds strange but bear with us. Helen explained that fingernail rubbing is an ayurvedic practice, which in Indian culture is believed to give you thick, dense and healthy hair. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. She said: Did you know that rubbing your fingernails together like this daily, stimulates the brain to send signals to adult stem cells to revive dormant and unproductive hair follicles. It also increases blood flow to the hair follicles for healthier hair growth.You think Iaposm crazy  Google it.So we did, and this is what we found.According to Health Shots, the practice shows its impact on the hair as the nerves below the nail bed are connected to the scalp and regular nail rubbing stimulates blood flow and oxygen to the scalp. And as Helen says, it also helps rejuvenate hair follicles and enhance hair growth. So give it a shot. All you need to do is curl the fingers in to form a half fist and rub the fingernails of each hand against each other briskly for around ten minutes. You can either do this all at once or spread the  minutes throughout the day, Helen says. The good thing is you can do this absolutely anywhere and itaposs completely free.

He dumped Bella and Celeste in oil tanks at an oil site where he worked and buried Ms Watts, who was  weeks pregnant, in a shallow grave. Watts, who did not want another child, was having an affair with a woman from work, Nichol Kessinger, and wanted to start a new le with her. He had reportedly been claiming for some time that he was separated and going through a orce - when he was in fact still with his we. A police interview in which Ms Kessinger - who is not suspected of any wrongdoing - was grilled about her relationship with Watts at the time of the murders, has emerged on YouTube,News.au reports.The clip, shared by Ms Watts’ family reveals a chilling new detail about the last text Watts ever sent his mistress. When news of Watts’ family’s disappearance hit the news in August , Ms Kessinger told police she had grilled Watts for answers. “I kept asking him, ‘What did you do, Chris  What did you do ’” she said. “I asked, ‘Where’s your family ’” Ms Kessinger said she had then messaged Watts a final time before she ended contact with him.  “So I texted Chris one last time, and I told him, ‘If you did anything bad, you’re going to ruin your le and you’re going to ruin my le. I promise you that’,” she said. “And he responded, ‘I didn’t hurt my family, Nicky.’ And that was the last text. I never said another word to him after that.” Police were initially made aware of Ms Watts and her kids’ disappearance by a family friend, who asked police to perform a welfare check. While Watts had initially denied any involvement in his family going missing, he later admitted to his crimes to avoid the death penalty.  It was while Ms Watts was on a business trip that Watts hatched his sick plan to kill his entire family. When she ed she and her husband had a huge row and Watts confessed to his affair. Devastated, Ms Watts told him in the heat of the moment that she would have full custody of their children. In cold blood Watts then strangled his we to death - but his brutal actions were witnessed. Steven Lambert, the lawyer representing Ms Watts family in a wrongful death lawsuit, told Americaaposs Dr Phil Show: The night in question Shanann came home. She and Chris had got into a fight. They made up. They were getting along really well. Later on, they got into a fight again. In that fight he essentially confessed to having an affair, that he wanted a orce. That it was pretty much over between them, and she had said something to the effect of, aposwell youaposre not going to see the kids againapos. As a consequence of that conversation he strangled her to death. But after Watts murdered her mother and was wrapping Ms Watts’ body in a blanket, little Bella walked into the room and asked what are you doing to mummy  The four year old, who was said to be bright for her age knew something was up, according to Mr Lambert. What happened next was truly chilling. Watts bundled Ms Watts’ body into the boot of the family car, put his two little girls in the backseat and belted them in. The murderous father then drove  minutes to an oil field before carrying out the second part of his horrying plan. During the journey, Bella is said to have pleaded with her dad to take -year-old Ms Watts to hospital. When they arrived at the oil field, first smothered Celeste with her favourite blanket. Bella witnessed the murder and begged her father not to kill her before trying to run away. Mr Lamber explained: At this point, Bella had unbuckled herself from the vehicle. The prosecution at Wattsapos court case claimed he had killed the little girl deliberately and viciously. Watts then buried his we in a shallow grave before disposing of the bodies of his two daughters in an oil tanker before ing to the family home and reporting all three of them missing. The killer even gave interviews to the press, pleading for his family to come home and claiming he had no clue where they had gone. Watts even sent his we text messages, asking her where she was, after he had killed her.

The breakthrough means scientists could in theory edit DNA from another bird such as a pigeon to include dodo DNA and recreate the species. The flightless bird was wiped out by th century sailors and the dogs they brought with them when Europeans discovered its native Mauritius. Its full genetic code has been discovered from “a fantastic specimen” of Dodo remains found stored in Denmark. Prof Beth Shapiro, of the University of Calornia, Santa Cruz, revealed her team had identied the full genetic code of the bird in a Royal Society of Medicine webinar.Prof Shapiro said: “Yes, the dodo genome is entirely sequenced because we sequenced it. “It’s not been published yet, but it does exist and we’re working on it right now. I tried for a long time to get DNA from a specimen that’s in Oxford. “We got a tiny little bit of DNA… but that particular sample didn’t have sufficiently well-preserved DNA.”  However Prof Shapiro explained recreating a bird would be more dficult than the  cloning of mammal Dolly the Sheep in Scotland. “Mammals are simpler,” she said.Thereported the news of the scientic breakthrough which has given hope for the species. “If I have a cell and it’s living in a dish in the lab and I edit it so that it has a bit of dodo DNA how do I then transform that cell into a whole living breathing actual animal  “The way we can do this is to clone it, the same approach that was used to create ‘Dolly the Sheep’, but we don’t know how to do that with birds because of the intricacies of their reproductive pathways.  “So there needs to be another approach for birds and this is one really fundamental technological hurdle in de-extinction. “There are groups working on dferent approaches for doing that and I have little doubt that we are going to get there but it is an additional hurdle for birds that we don’t have for mammals.” Prof Mike Benton, a palaeontologist at Bristol University, said: “The dodo is a popular bird and it’s one you can make a case for bringing back.  “If you bring T-Rex back to le, maybe that wouldn’t be the popular thing as it would run riot and cause havoc. “But bringing back something that wasn’t so ancient would be much more feasible.

walk on the wild side at its latest meeting as Argyll Estates# head stalker set his sights on an entertaining evening.Tom Kirsop provided society members with an informative and imaginative talk at their February gathering, covering his work and experiences on the local estate.Growing up in Clydebank, Tom had always had an interest in animals and moved to Argyll as a forest ranger in Dalmally.Since starting to work with Argyll Estates, which he thoroughly enjoys, Tom has been able to develop his work with animals in many dferent ways.In Queen Victoria’s time the current ,-acre estate was on an even bigger scale and has witnessed a huge increase in the number of deer since then.This has been due to the lack of any natural predators and, with further planting of trees since the s, the deer have had more protective covering.Modern inventions such as drones and the use of argocats, have made it easier for people working on estates to estimate numbers of deer more accurately and to be able to meet the necessary annual targets of keeping the deer population to manageable levels.Working on the estate also involves a range of other projects, such as collecting data on golden eagles, barn owls, making fishing available at the Glen Shira dam and taking clients out stalking.More recently Tom has started up West Highland Wildle Tours to give people of all ages a real insight into the wildle and beautul scenery on our doorstep.For the society#s March meeting, Ken MacTaggart will give a presentation about #The Medieval Pilgrim Way to Loch Awe#.The venue will be Inveraray church hall on Tuesday March , starting at .pm.Everyone is welcome.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

It is now waterlogged, not suitable for construction.An environmental impact assessment is essential. His proposed site is wild land, habitat to wildle – deer, foxes, possibly badgers, many bird species, some rare, and bats too.Lochend Wood will soon be completely surrounded by built environment.Development would be catastrophic for wildle, already suffering from signicant habitat loss and stress. Cllr Hampshire acknowledges “there is still wildle in the woodland and we will do everything we can to make sure we protect that”.Clearly, the best way to protect this area for wildle, including nocturnal species, is to NOT fill it with floodlights and noisy, boisterous humans.He continues: “People complain about young people hanging around and doing things they should not be doing.”Yet this proposal aims to attract kids to a location that is isolated and not overseen. This is dangerous. Emergency services have been called to deal with gatherings in the woods in recent times – ambulances for vulnerable young adolescents suffering serious alcohol effects, fire services, and police to disperse large groups. This location would create a perfect storm of risk.His vision – a ‘community cafe’, open  till  – would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install basic services to the site.

Previous letters on the topic appear to favour somewhere between  per cent and a two-thirds majority of those voting, and deep down I cannot really disagree with that provided no additional hurdles are put in the way.It is also high time unionists stopped harping on about the “overwhelming” result for the No side in the referendum of . A two-thirds majority in favour of the Union would have been a result of .% instead of the somewhat lowly % achieved for the status quo and obviously % for the losers. Statistics can be moulded to any argument andwe look at actual votes rather than percentages in the  referendum, figures show that had only , more votes been cast for Yes than No, the result would have been for independence by one vote. Little wonder unionists were and are worried, especially as a new independence campaign is yet to start.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.BREXIT DAMAGE IS STILL EVIDENTTHE excellent Ian McConnell hits the mark with his revealing article on the grim reality of Brexit and the scale of the damage to exporters and trade . Astonishingly, we are constantly being assured by Boris Johnson and his ministers that Brexit has been a great success. The fact that the almost Soviet-sounding title of Minister for Brexit Opportunities and Government Efficiency has been awarded to Jacob Rees-Mogg, nicknamed the MP for the th Century, speaks volumes.Mr McConnell rightly points out that \"companies and consumers have had to become used to a lack of availability, delays in getting materials and parts, and higher prices for the things they can buy\". I know of at least one major retailer which in March is receiving deliveries of stock which were supposed to have arrived before Christmas.Ruth Marr, Stirling.ENERGY GIANTS SHOULD LEVEL DOWNI AM delighted to see that the UK Government is willing to support not only The Herald by paying for today’s “Levelling Up” cover , but also Scotland’s recycling aspirations by so efficiently topping up our blue bins.Within its inane covers, in the true tradition of trite Tory mantras, “Levelling Up” contrives to achieve a neatly-rounded -pronged aspiration. Number Four boasts “a £bn boost for the green industrial revolution”. Apart from the oxymoronic challenge of the language, the number rang a bell – double-digit billions of pounds. It echoes recent energy giant profits: over , ExxonMobil turned a £.bn loss into a £bn profit Shell has raised its £.bn to £.bn BP from £.bn to £.bn the “Big Six” British energy suppliers’ profits in were already over £bn.While our population faces unprecedented increases in energy costs, unprecedented profits from such polluters might have merited a “green industrial” windfall tax to ease our % hit. After all, Emmanuel Macron has instructed Eon to limit increased domestic charges to four per cent in France. But no, Boris Johnson deems that we have to cover costs.Keith Reid, Blairgowrie.* YOUR four-page advertisement for Levelling Up was a bit alarming: I thought UK Government civil servants would at least have a decent grasp of English. We had “more people owning their own homes – and much more to make a real dference to our everyday lives” printed twice in the same sentence. Perhaps an extended example of epizeuxis more likely just sloppiness. I’m not even sure that more home ownership, as encouraged by Margaret Thatcher, is automatically good, and I note that it’s followed by a plug for “a thriving private sector”.Elsewhere in the puff from gov.uk we had “Levelling Up means not only having more, but better skilled jobs”. Having more of what  And then there is “the £m Community Ownership Fund which gives people over the UK to protect and take over local assets…” I think I know what they mean, but it’s not written in the English taught by the redoubtable Doc Forrest at Robert Gordon’s College in Aberdeen.Feedback for the “UK Government Scotland”, as it styles itself: A poor effort, with little attention to detail must do better.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.STOP BACKING SAUDI REGIMEEIGHTY-ONE men are killed in one day by the Saudi Arabian regime under Prince Mohammed bin Salman with no condemnation by Boris Johnson and his Tory Government about these executions, due process violations or torture-extracted confessions . Instead he goes cap in hand to this dictatorship to plead for more oil to be produced to help the British economy.There will be no mention by Mr Johnson and his cronies about the arbitrary arrests and executions of  Shia Muslims among the above by the Saudi regime which has a record of persecution of this group. There will be no mark of respect for the lives stolen away like Aqeel Al-Faraj, Mortada al-Musa, Yasin al-Brahim, Mohammed al-Shakhouri , Asad Al-Shibr and others with relatives only belatedly finding out about their deaths and not knowing were they are buried.The invasion of Ukraine is a heinous crime condemned correctly by the British Government, but the unconditional support by that same Government of the brutal Saudi regime that tortures and kills their own people amounts to double standards.Sean Clerkin, Barrhead.SALUTE COURAGE OF JOURNALISTSTHE horric events being reported daily from Ukraine continue to shock and disgust. However, as the BBC correspondent Quentin Sommerville points out,we are surprised at the carnage and destruction that Vladimir Putin has unleashed upon the innocent, then we have not been paying attention. This is what Russian military forces do, whether in Georgia, Chechnya, Syria or now Ukraine.The grim news that two Fox News journalists and a US film maker have lost their lives in the countryreminds us that one of the pillars of democracy, freedom of speech, comes at a heavy price. Make no mistake, those who honestly report what is happening in areas of conflict are seen as targets by President Putin and his ilk. Marie Colvin, for example, was assassinated in a rocket attack in Syria by a government which disapproved of her journalism. The courage of Quentin Sommerville, Lyse Doucet, Lindsey Hilsum, Jeremy Bowen and others who keep us accurately informed about this war should not be underestimated, nor taken for granted.Bob Scott, Drymen.HAVE FACE MASKS BEEN WORKING NICOLA Sturgeon has delayed the plan to relax the legal requirement to wear masks in certain settings, because of, she says, “the current spike in case numbers” . But doesnt this spike suggest that masks havent been working Geoff Moore, Alness.* APPARENTLY Scotlands higher infection rates are, according to John Swinney, because we are \"ahead of the curve\" but this necessitating a further two weeks of mask wearing.Ive just ed from France, Netherlands and Italy, where they insist on you wearing FFP Medical Grade masks and consider cloth masks to be in the category of chocolate teapots.The First Minister might need to upgrade her natty tartan face coveringsshe is to re-enter the EU.Ian McNair, Cellardyke.Read more: We have to convince Putin that the West does have a red line"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-cracking-freedom-speech-universities-worrying-new-trend","story":"Freedom of speech, dialogue and debate is surely the raison dêtre of a university. Following the Nadhim Zahawi threat to ‘‘crack down hard’’ on pro-Kremlin views in higher education, the Scottish Government has been urged to do more to stop university lecturers sharing “pro-Putin propaganda’’ . As so often in these situations, JS Mill said it all: ‘‘The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race posterity as well as the existing generation those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth:wrong, they lose what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.’’It is clearly too late to promote such notions in our universities the remedy must begin in our schools. Every school should have a debating society, and every pupil should be a member and be given the tools and encouraged to develop and use their critical thinking skills to take part.Doug Clark, Currie.DOUBLE STANDARDS ON FOOTBALL PROTESTSWE all stand appalled at the attack on Ukraine and the dreadful impact this is having on the Ukrainian people.As a football supporter, seeing the many gestures, symbols and Ukraine flags of support flying in stadia across the UK has demonstrated the capacity of fans to come together to call out injustice and stand against oppression .It is welcome that footballing authorities have not imposed fines and sanctions on clubs for allowing this to happen.Why then have Scotland and some of its clubs been fined and sanctioned for flying flags of support for Palestinians who are continuing to endure military invasion and occupation  Does their resistance somehow disqualy them from offering support. What does that mean for future Ukrainian resistance Shrugging our shoulders at one breach of international law provides cover for other such breaches. Using football sanctions to enable \"sportswashing\" isn’t just about oligarchs and oil sheiks.Give the fines imposed on Scotland and its clubs to support those oppressed by war and invasion and stop the fines in future.John Davidson, Carnoustie.PLAYING DUMB WITH SMART METERSTHE back page of the Business section is of more than passing interest for me today as it mentions my energy supplier, Shell Energy and my smart meter provider, Smart Metering Systems . I had more than five years good experience with a former energy supplier who gave me a smart meter discounted rate because they didnt need to read the meters and I was provided with an In House Displaywhich allowed me to understand where and when energy was being used.Unfortunately, that provider was bought over by Shell Energyand after a bit, the gas consumption loggingon the IHD stopped working. To cut a long story short, following the installation of second-generation smart meters and a new IHD, the IHD is still blank and \"waiting for information\". Smart Metering Systems assures me theres nothing wrong at my end but \"the system\" is not receiving information from the supplier. Theres not a lot of incentive for Shell Energy to fix this, as it continues to get \"smart\" readings and is issuing bills. So it gave me £ off my bill and advice like the proverbial \"switch it off for  hours\" or \"you might need new meters\". Communication with the provider is not at all \"smart\".I suspect I am not the only energy user with similar problems and evenfixed, it doesnt look like the new IHDs are going to give me the same quality of information as I used to receive. Whether its because the national \"system\" is not working properly or the people at Shell Energy who are answering my complaints dont understand how it works, I dont know. However, Shell Energy is already at second from bottom on Which  Magazines customer score table and might get the wooden spoon in the next issue.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.FACULTY HEADS A FALSE ECONOMYI HAVE to agree with Eric Melvin , who stated that the creation of secondary school faculty heads was triggered by the need to save money. It was certainly not a proposition founded upon educational grounds.It meant that the head of faculty was responsible for a subject grouping in some of which that head had no real expertise, whereas the old subject principal was on top of the game with direct expertise in the areas under the subject principals control.Money and the saving thereof was at the root of that innovation and it has impaired the proficiency of the person at the top along with the performance of the members of the faculty who do not feel that they have any signicant part to play in that cobbling together of disparate disciplines.Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is characteristic of many educational reforms when politicians interfere in the running of the education system.We would not go about building houses in the way that we go about educating our youngsters. Unless the foundations are laid properly, there can be no satisfactory outcome in either case.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.GAMBLING WITH THE LOTTERYCAMELOT has lost the franchise for the National Lottery from . While I don’t necessarily approve of Camelot, I am concerned that the franchise for the lottery is being given to Allwyn, the UK subsidiary of Sazka. Sazka is owned by the Czech oil and gas tycoon Karl Komarek. This is somewhat akin to giving the lottery to an oligarch to run.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He pushes standards in training, and he is a winner.“He has led the group this campaign, and he has been excellent. The fact he is achieving  caps at home in Cardf is brilliant for him and his family.”Asked about the fly-half scrutiny in Wales, Jones added: “You have to develop your mental resilience. That is one aspect that you have to make sure you are solid on.“It’s part and parcel of the number  jersey. You fully realise the responsibility that goes with it when you play for Wales.“So much is asked of the number s, whether it be their decision-making, how they manage the game, goalkicking. It’s a huge responsibility that goes with the jersey.”It will be a landmark afternoon at the Principality Stadium on #SuperSaturday 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿#GuinnessSixNations | #WALvITA pic rTQlmOY— Guinness Six NationsMarch , While Biggar will become the seventh Welshman to clock up a century for his country, team-mate Alun Wyn Jones extends his ongoing world record, hitting  caps after recovering ahead of schedule from a shoulder injury that required two operations.Stephen Jones added: “ caps is amazing. The way he plays the game, he continually raises the bar and sets the standard for the group.“”It is unbelievable, it’s as simple as that, especially in the positionhe plays, which is so physical and demanding.“The manner in which he plays the game as well, the way he trains and pushes his body. He is mentally tough and resilient, and for us, he is such a leader and important person in this group.“The way Al conducts himself, he is the ultimate professional, and for both of them to share a wonderful experience on the same day is something they should be very proud of.” – @WelshRugbyUnions Alun Wyn Jones has made  tackles in the #GuinnessSixNations, more than any other player, while teammate Taulupe Faletau is just  away from becoming the rd player to reach  in the Championship.

wins a second term in next month’s election.Mr Macron spoke at a press conference that was his first major campaign event – taking time off from his focus on the war in Ukraine to provide details about his vision for the next five years.He vowed to push ahead with a controversial pension reform that would “progressively” raise the retirement age from  to , and suggested that people who start working at a young age would still be able to retire before .Boosting France’s growth must go through “investing more” and “working more”, Mr Macron added, vowing to achieve “full employment”. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron arrives on stage for a presidential campaign news conference in Aubervilliers, north of Paris The unemployment rate recently reached .%, down from more than % when he came into power.Mr Macron also promised to keep investing in the French military, and fight inequalities at school and in healthcare access, amid other proposals.Asked about his campaign’s motto, he said he wants the French to be “stronger and happier all together”.Even though he formally announced he is running for a second term at the beginning of the month, Mr Macron has not held any rallies yet.He has been criticised by other candidates for refusing to take part in any televised debate before the first voting round, scheduled on April .In recent days, he pushed for a ceasefire in Ukraine during phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and spoke on an almost daily basis with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.Last week, he gathered EU leaders at the Versailles palace, west of Paris, to discuss sanctions against Russia.France holds the rotating presidency of the European Union Council, which gives Mr Macron a key role in co-ordinating the bloc of ’s response. vw,vw,px, px\"Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech Next week, he is expected to be seen alongside US President Joe Biden at Nato’s summit in Brussels.Mr Macron recently released unusual pictures of himself working nights and weekends at the Elysee Palace, looking tired and unshaven, in jeans and a hoodie.If that is part of a campaign strategy it seems to be paying off, reinforcing his position as frontrunner in the race while making it dficult for other contenders to challenge him.Pollster Bernard Sananes, president of poll institute Elabe, said that “obviously the international situation is reinforcing his stature”.“It gives the impression that Macron in  has been elected on a promise to renewand that Macron in  wants to be elected on the promise ofexperience,” he said in an interview with French newspaper L’Opinion.Polls show most French, whether they intend to vote for him or not, consider he is up to the job, he stressed.Polls see Mr Macron about  percentage points ahead of far-right contender Marine Le Pen, placing them both in a position to reach the run-off and replay the  election.They show that in that case the French president is widely expected to win. vw,vw,px, px\"The French president is ahead in the polls Another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, far-left figure Jean-Luc Melenchon, and conservative contender Valerie Pecresse are among the other challengers.Rivals have accused Mr Macron of focusing on Ukraine to avoid domestic issues which may prove more tricky for him.Ms Le Pen said Mr Macron is “using the war in Ukraine to scare French people, because he thinks scaring can benefit him”.“When there’s a war, there’s a reflex to be legitimist,” Ms Pecresse said.“People think: there’s a captain leading the operation … We must not be afraid to change the captain on April ,” she added.Advocates for Mr Macron argue that the situation in Ukraine involves key domestic issues that are being fully debated in the campaign, such as energy and defence policies.Political history expert Jean Garrigues stressed the “unying” impact around the head of state in a war-related situation.“We can see that Macron’s adversaries have no experience equivalent to the presidential , or even as key ministers, and are de facto in a situation of inferiority,” he noted. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech Pollsters said Mr Macron’s greatest challenge as the frontrunner may be a low turnout, with sympathisers not going to polling stations because they think he will win, while those angry at his policies would further mobilise.Mr Macron himself acknowledged the risk in a behind-the-scenes video posted on his campaign’s YouTube channel.“That’s what I’m going to tell the French, and also my supporters:

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values. They are that memorable phrase we hear our elders say once they have explained its meaning to us, we are unlikely to forget it.Theyto us often and roll off the tongue.One of the most important collections of Gaelic proverbs was published in  by Alexander Nicolson .However, Nicolson was merely re-printing a collection made by Donald Macintosh, a Perthshire-born clergyman, first printed in Edinburgh in . Nicolson called the collection “a genuine product of the past” with Macintosh merely acting as collator and translator. of Islay, perhaps coined in the times when the MacLeans, MacDonalds, and later Campbells feuded over the island the second one is a rhyme about the MacAlpines, their former seat in Dunstaffnage, and their ancient claim to the throne of Scotland:When the natives forsake Islay, farewell the peace of Scotland!Children of the native kings, Who reigned down at Dunstaffnage, Who first the crown of Alba owned, And still have native claim to it..It also tells us that there are always grave, far-reaching political consequences whenever an indigenous population is forced to abandon its home.as a hereditary right can last for centuries. The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good. Psychologically and spiritually, we inherit their trauma physically, as the proverb reminds us, we may inherit their medical conditions.By accepting the full extent of our inheritance – strength and weakness, the beautul and the ugly – we grow closer to our ancestors and empower ourselves to heal from what they could not.has always been characterised by plurality and complexity, reflecting the complex Gàidhealtachd to which it belonged.For centuries, fostering children has been an important feature of Gaelic society, and for all the influence that DNA can have on us, the nurture we receive during our formative years has just as much –not more – influence on who we become within our community.In a changing world, it is inspiring to see people across the Gàidhealtachd connecting with the cultural ‘mycelium’ of their place and rooting themselves in it, whether it is their ancestral homeland or adoptive home.can be a wellspring of transformative energy for place-based revitalisation.Sometimes it seems to burst like lightning, explosively cleaving through adversity.

I’m wonderingyou could help drum-up some interest in my oral history project ‘Manufacturing Memory’. It uses Gallaher’s Lisnafillan factory to explore the working lives of female industrial workersand the wider impact of redundancies and closure on the Ballymena economy. My background is in industrial and working-class history. I used Harland  Wolff and the British coal industry as case studies for my PhD at Queen’s . There’s quite a bias towards male-employing heavy industries in academic studies, so I’m focusing instead on a ‘light’ industry that employed women in large numbers. Gallaher’s was the obvious choice – the Ballymena plant in particular. “It’s important to get these perspectives on the record as the working lives of women in industry still remains, to a large extent, ‘hidden history’. Pete explained that interviews would only last a short time.I’m looking to interviewwomen who worked at Lisnafillan any time since . THOUGHTS“I’d like to understand why they chose Gallaher’s, the nature of their job, shopfloor culture, balancing motherhood family le with employment – before moving on to their thoughts on why the factory closed, how they navigated redundancy, and the impact on Ballymena’s economy. Interviews will last around  hour, and interviewees will be sent a full transcript for review. Anonymity can be granteddesired. One of the planned outputs is a temporary exhibition in The Braid using extracts from these interviews, supplemented by archival documents and photographs unearthed at PRONI and National Museums Northern Ireland.

In addition, almost % of our woodland is in the form of recent coner plantations.The Woodland Trust said Northern Ireland needs to signicantly increase tree plantingit is to help towards a UK woodland target.The conservation charity previously published its Emergency Tree Plan. The plan sets out how the UK can rapidly increase tree cover to help reach net zero carbon emissions and tackle the declines in wildle.Northern Ireland would need to plant , hectares of trees a year to hit an existing target of % cover by . To contribute to this, the Forests For our Future Programme announced by Mr Poots in March  set targets to create , hectares of new woodland by , which falls well short of those recommended by the Woodland Trust.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas a woodland expansion target  hectares for  .Ammonia emissionsAmmonia is an air pollutant largely emitted from agriculture and has a damaging impact on bioersity, including sensitive habitats, as well as human health. It is produced by many common farming activities, such as the housing of livestock, the storage and spreading of manure and slurries, and the application of fertiliser.An Audit Office report from February found that most areas of Northern Ireland, including designated sites and other priority habitats, are affected by high levels of nitrogen being deposited on land and into water surfaces.The levels in most areas are signicantly above what is considered their “critical load”, the concentration of nitrogen at which signicant ecological damage occurs. Northern Ireland is responsible for % of UK ammonia emissions, despite only having % of its population and % of its land area, and is the only region of the UK where ammonia levels have not been decreasing.“Failure to address the increasing level of ammonia emissions also has the potential to contribute to serious, long-term harm to the environment and human health,” the report concluded.Mr Poots has conceded that a failure to publish an Ammonia Reduction Strategywill be a regret when he leaves office and it is one that has left the department vulnerable to legal challenge. However, he stresses that he wants to publish a strategy before leaving office.Independent Environmental Protection AgencyUnder an outline programme for government in the New Decade, New Approach, a number of coordinated measures to reverse climate change were laid out.They included an Independent Environmental Protection Agencyto oversee targets that would be set as part of climate change legislation.Mr Poots is opposed to the establishment of an IEPA, believing it to be unnecessary bureaucracy. However, he has proposed setting up an office of environmental protection to do similar independent work.Conservation Management PlansNorthern Ireland is home to important nature and wildle, of both national and international importance, which are a key part of the Northern Ireland landscape, providing a wide range of goods and services to society and helping to deal with climate change.The UK faced formal infringement proceedings by the European Commission because of the failure to have in place Conservation Management Plansfor its European sites.There are  special areas of conservation and  special protection areas in Northern Ireland. Strangford Lough and Rathlin Island were reported to the commission as having a CMP in place.That leaves  sites without such plans in Northern Ireland.At the time of the infraction proceedings it was reported to the Commission Rathlin Island and Strangford Lough had Conservation Management Plansin place.The Commission took the view that developing CMPs for each of the remaining SACs would signicantly contribute to addressing the alleged failings to comply with the obligations under the Habitats Directive.DAERA subsequently embarked on a signicant programme of work to develop such CMPs to date draft CMPs have been developed for  of the SAC sites, with the intention to have draft plans for all SACs completed by December .Clear AirAir pollution is the top environmental risk to human health in the UK, and the fourth greatest threat to public health after cancer, heart disease and obesity.The Clean Air Strategy, published in January  by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs , sets out a number of objectives to improve air quality across the UK.Additionally, DAERA issued a Clean Air Strategy for Northern Ireland Discussion Document for public consideration in November . The period of public discussion closed in early .This strategy aims to build on existing improvements within Northern Ireland and seeks to tackle important cross-Departmental issues relating to transport, energy, agriculture, industry, local air quality management, and communications.An air quality strategy was anticipated but has not been published. Minister Poots says that recommendations await the next office holder.Mobuoy super dumpAt public meetings, government officials have been repeatedly challenged to urgently deal with an estimated one million cubic metres of waste at the Mobuoy “super dump” on the outskirts of Derry. The River Faughan which forms the western boundary of the site supplies the city with % of its drinking water.Ongoing legal action has been blamed for delaying remediation work at the site. That trial is due to commence next month.The clean-up cost at Mobuoy has been estimated at a minimum of £ million — and potentially as much as £ million.NI Water and DAERA have always assured the public that chemicals present in drinking water are at safe levels. However, campaigners contend there are “no safe levels” of arsenic or manganese as exposure to such chemicals can have a long-term damaging effect on the brain.It is expected that based on successful approval of a business case, a remediation contractor will be appointed by late .Ban on petroleum licensingIn a somewhat unexpected move, the DUP Economy Minister, Gordon Lyons, announced that he would support a ban on fracking and onshore petroleum licensing activity in Northern Ireland.Fracking is broadly banned across the UK and Ireland. In England, the Government told the industry it would not agree to any future fracking “until compelling new evidence is provided” that it was safe.Two petroleum licensing applications in NI relate to Fermanagh, where a company called Tamboran Resources UK applied for a licence in .A separate application from EHA Exploration takes in five council areas: Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Mid Ulster.However, Sinn Fein said it is “bitterly disappointing” that as a result of the DUP collapsing the Executive, that ban cannot now be brought forward.Water pollutionA recent ‘Water Framework Directive Statistics Report’ determined that none of Northern Ireland’s  rivers, lakes and coastal waters achieved a “good overall status” rating for water quality.Environmentalists have argued that minimal fines handed down for water pollution do not act as an appropriate deterrent for repeat offenders.Figures obtained by Green Party MLA Rachel Woods showed that more than seven million tonnes of raw sewage is being dumped into Northern Ireland’s seas and rivers every year.NI Water requires investment of around £bn in water and wastewater services over a six year period, the Utility Regulator said in May. This financial year the DfI Minister allocated a combined budget £m to NI Water for  .Coal banSmoky coal is one of the worst causes of air pollution. It has been reported that approximately , premature deaths have been averted in Dublin since the introduction of a coal ban back in . In the past, DUP MP Sammy Wilson strongly opposed proposals saying that low-income households who use cheap coal would be adversely affected as smokeless coal costs more.In response, then Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: “It is great to hear Saint Sammy, defender of the disadvantaged — I do not know what happened to Sammy, the champion of the Tory cuts — make all these arguments on behalf of those suffering fuel poverty.“There is not a word about the big business interests of those in the coal business or, indeed, the interests of Larne port in his own constituency.”DUP MLA Michelle McIlveen, who was DAERA Minister before the Assembly collapsed, also said it was not her intention to ban smoky coal in the North.Now, Mr Poots, says he has no intention of banning coal because people would “die of hypothermia” in homes that are not properly insulated.Most ReadPO Ferries confirm  staff have been made redundant after firm made £m lossBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKTop VideosPlayPO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementPlayVideo: St Patrick#s day parade in BelfastPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayLatest EnvironmentMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontStormont crisis ‘farcical and very damaging’ – Green Party leader easy ways to ‘green-proof’ your home that won’t cost the earth and will reduce your billsSam McBrideOpinionBasic, inexcusable failures mean that recyclable items are being dumpedLatestHostages like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe ‘face long journey to normality’Ireland targeting best performance of Six Nations in pivotal Scotland clash‘Increasing levels’ of Covid driven by jump in rates among - year-oldsFTSE gains after Bank’s interest rate decisionFather of three to drive emergency supplies to Ukraine in borrowed van,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Kilroot power station said that shipment was not for it, and it last brought in Russian coal on th February. The power station, which dominates the northern shoreline of Belfast Lough just east of Carrickfergus, is our last coal-fired electricity generation plant and is due to close next year.Read MoreUkrainian refugee scheme: Vital that sponsors in Northern Ireland are properly checked, warns anti-slavery expertUp to £m of RHI money may go unspent by StormontHowever, it is still key to keeping the lights on, and has been called upon more in recent years due to problems at other power stations and unusually calm days reducing wind power generation.Coal was Russia’s third most valuable export by value in , bringing in £.bn. Northern Ireland was the only UK region to see coal-fired electricity generation increase that year, accounting for % of all electricity.Energy imports from Russia have not been banned, but have come under scrutiny due to revulsion at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of the war through the targeting of civilians.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Kilroot’s position appears similar to that of Shell, which bought Russian oil — entirely legally — days into the Ukraine war, but backtracked under huge public pressure and promised not to do so again.Read MoreMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionMy utility bills now cost £ a week. Pensioners are in big troubleHowever, Kilroot’s situation is complicated by what it says is a requirement in its licence to buy Russian coal for environmental reasons, because it is low-sulphur, and thus somewhat reduces air pollution when burned.!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"When Stormont’s Department for the Economy, which is responsible for electricity policy, was askedit believed environmental rules should be relaxed to allow Kilroot to burn dirtier coal, it initially washed its hands of the matter, saying: “The department does not have responsibility for environmental rules. This is the responsibility of DAERA Northern Ireland Environment Agency .”That answer came despite the RHI Inquiry recommending Stormont stopped operating in silos and behaved coherently as a single government entity.However, Kilroot’s owner then told the Belfastit had been meeting the department, NIEA, electricity grid operator SONI and the Utility Regulator to discuss this issue since the crisis began. That was put to the Department for the Economy and to Edwin Poots’ Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for NIEA.But there was no response at the time of going to press.EP Kilroot, a subsidiary of Czech company Energetický, which owns the plant, said it “condemns the indefensible aggression and actions by Russia”.It added that it “complies with all UK sanctions and associated regulations in relation to Russia”, and stressed there were “signicant stock levels of coal on the Kilroot site at present”.It said: “We have contingency plans in place for alternative sources of coal supply. “This plan requires changing EP Kilroot’s permit, which currently prevents us from using coals from other countries.“Since the start of the Ukraine crisis, EP Kilroot has chaired a number of roundtable workshops with officials from DfE, NIEA, the Utility Regulator and SONI to urgently address the issues of the current permitting arrangements to enable EP Kilroot to remove its reliance on Russian coal.“If the permitting arrangements are not changed, we believe there will be signicant security of supply risks that SONI will need to manage.”The company claimed there could also be “signicant additional costs” for consumers “depending on the extent to which the coal units are restricted”.When DfE, headed by DUP minister Gordon Lyons, was asked for its view on whether Kilroot should continue to buy Russian coal, the department expressed no preference, and said: “The purchase of coal is a commercial decision taken by EP Kilroot. However, the department will follow the guidance that has been issued by the UK Government in relation to Russian imports.”When asked how much coal stocks were in place at Kilroot, DfE said “this is not a matter for the department”, but SONI would tell itthere was a problem. When asked how much secondary fuel was stored at Kilroot, DfE said that was a matter for the company.SONI said it was “unaware of any immediate risk to coal stock at Kilroot”. It said inspection of fuel stocks was “not a matter for SONI”. It added Kilroot “has a key role to play in the energy transition”, involving the current generators as well as new gas turbines.Belfast Harbour said it was “working closely with shipping agents and relevant partners to implement all of the Government’s legislative sanctions on Russian vessels”, but it would only bar vessels excluded by law, rather than go further.The Utility Regulator said Kilroot was responsible for ensuring it held adequate fuel stocks. It added: “In light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine, we are working with DfE to proactively monitor the situation, and are engaging with EP Kilroot and other key stakeholders on a regular basis about fuel stocks and fuel security arrangements.”Overall imports of coal have generally been falling, but have risen to the point where they are now roughly where they were in , despite the reduction in the use of coal for home-heating and electricity generation.Irish state-owned electricity company ESB said it will not be taking delivery of Russian coal to its Moneypoint power station in Co Clare “for the foreseeable future”.

It takes me three hours at work to pay for my travel with my shts on average being between seven and eight hours.”With the cost-of-living crisis, she said young workers feel they should receive a pay rise and get the top minimum wage hourly rate of £., as they work as hard as someone aged .Unison’s Saoirse Fanning said the survey findings around Covid were particularly concerning.Twenty-five per cent could not self-isolate, % couldn’t afford to, and % said their employer wouldn’t allow it.She added: “We have been fighting for our members to get paid in full while off sick with Covid- or having to isolate.“Some employers were only paying statutory sick pay, even though money was available from the Department for Communities to pay staff in full.” She said the privatisation of services meant front line staff were on “poverty pay and poor terms and conditions”.She called for a social clause to be included in all contracts outsourced to the community sector.Independent councillor Gary Donnelly said what he was hearing was “shocking”, and asked what council could do to assist.Ms Ward said workers doing the same job should receive the same pay rate regardless of age.Mr McCarroll said Derry suffered from deprivation and neglect from ious governments and it can’t be the case that the city progresses on the back of local workers getting paid just over £ an hour without sick pay.He suggested the council look at wage inequalities and exploitation, and that hospitality businesses should make their pay rates known on menus.People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin branded wages for teenagers “a disgrace” and said every worker should receive at least the minimum wage.He proposed initiating research to get an accurate assessment of pay scales across the council area. He was told a motion could be brought before the full council.Councillor Derek Hussey, who has been in the hospitality business since , said he was “really shocked” by Grace and Cliona’s revelations.“The figures you’re quoting, I wouldn’t have got away with back when I first started in the business,” he added.“At the weekend I had an event and had to bring in part-time workers. I can assure you that I had to pay well — well over the minimum wage in order to actually get folk to work.”The DUP’s Hilary McClintock said for someone to have to work for three hours to pay travel and to not have guaranteed hours was “exploitation”.Related topicsDerry City and Strabane District CouncilCost of LivingPeople Before ProfitMore On Derry City and Strabane District CouncilNI was ‘undersold’ by Government’s levelling-up fund, insists CampbellNI rates explainer: Why are they rising and where is your money going Bigger rates bills on way for all Northern Ireland householdsCouncil withholds £ Good Relations funding from Castlederg loyalist bandPolice in Derry investigate ‘unnotied parade’ not connected to commemorationsMost ReadPO Ferries confirm  staff have been made redundant after firm made £m lossBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKTop VideosPlayPO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementPlayVideo: St Patrick#s day parade in BelfastPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayLatest Northern IrelandRevellers enjoy first St Patrick’s celebrations in three yearsSturgeon tells PO Ferries boss of ‘utter disgust’ after  workers sackedUnions threaten legal action over ‘shameful’ sacking of PO workersThousands flock to Belfast city centre for St Patrick’s Day celebrationsPO will not operate ships from Larne for ‘another week’ according to Economy Minister Gordon LyonsLatestHostages like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe ‘face long journey to normality’Ireland targeting best performance of Six Nations in pivotal Scotland clash‘Increasing levels’ of Covid driven by jump in rates among - year-oldsFTSE gains after Bank’s interest rate decisionFather of three to drive emergency supplies to Ukraine in borrowed van,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireSam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailStormont is on course to waste at least £m — and perhaps as much as £m — over the next  years due to its failure to find a way to spend Treasury funding made available to Northern Ireland for subsidising renewable heat.As revealed by the Belfastlast week, £m has already been wasted in this way and there is no sign of the Department for the Economy producing an alternative proposal for how it can spend the money.However, new figures show the vast scale of the waste aheadthe situation remains unaltered. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Renewable Heat Association— which represents most RHI claimants — the department said that it was now on course to underspend by around £m. However, those figures only cover expenditure until , yet the GB RHI scheme — from whose budget Northern Ireland’s share of money for renewable heat is derived — has been extended and will not now close until .Based on that longer duration for the GB scheme, RHANI has calculated that Northern Ireland’s underspend may be closer to £m.Read MoreCriticism as Queen’s University Belfast ‘spends over £k’ on Amazon during pandemicThe hidden RHI scandal of how Stormont wasted £m in green energy subsidiesThe department said that it “will explore the potential to utilise any available [Treasury] funds in support of alternative or additional actions to decarbonise heat”. However, there is still no suggestion that this work has reached an advanced stage nor even that it will be possible because the Executive remains unable to decide how to handle existing RHI claimants.Those claimants were promised unalterable payments for  years but once the calamitous scale of the RHI overspend became apparent, Stormont abandoned that promise and retrospectively slashed their payments, meaning the actual overspend was £.m.That decision made them far less well rewarded than their counterparts in Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland, which recently launched its own version of RHI — putting Northern Irish businesses at a competitive disadvantage.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sources within the DUP suggest that the party is split on how to handle the situation. Former leader Arlene Foster — the minister who set up the disastrous scheme but then said she was “accountable but not responsible” for the mess which followed — had endorsed a policy of throwing all RHI claimants out of the scheme, paying them a fraction of what they were originally promised as compensation. Sinn Fein has also endorsed this policy, but other DUP figures believe it is unfair to those claimants who entered the scheme in good faith, took on huge loans at the suggestion of its minister and government officials, and who did not abuse RHI.There is another factor which might explain the decision not to spend such a vast sum of money. The retrospective cuts to subsidies which had been guaranteed were immediately challenged in court by claimants. However, that process has moved tortoise-like over the last five years and has not yet gone to the Supreme Court. That case is just one of several RHI legal actions, the outcome of which the department cannot be certain.It may be that its decision not to launch a new green heat scheme is a way of hedging against the possibility that the original scheme is reinstated and it faces a vast compensation bill.Whatever the reason, it is having an increasingly stark impact. As oil and gas prices soar, renewables are among the cheapest alternatives — but have high up-front costs to install, which is why subsidies are in place where across the UK and Ireland.RHANI executive chairman Andrew Trimble said: “If civil servants had not removed  words from the national legislation on renewable heat when the NI legislation was implemented, then today we would have a strong, sustainable, environmentally friendly renewable heat sector. We would be contributing to our pathway to net zero and have a vastly reduced reliance on fossil fuels — with their polluting emissions reduced by %.”He said that Stormont could solve the problem by reinstating the missing  words — essentially replicating the GB scheme, with cost controls, something he said “could solve the political problems that Stormont and the department have created for themselves and for the people of Northern Ireland”.Mr Trimble highlighted that in , a Commons committee inquiry branded the department’s actions “a raw deal”, but the department had repeatedly failed to help genuine claimants suffering as a result of their broken promises.Related topicsDepartment for the EconomyThe Executive OfficeArlene FosterSinn FéinClimate ChangeMore On Department for the EconomyGreens urge Northern Ireland Executive to help Kilroot power station to stop using Russian coal‘No plans’ to ration NI’s energy over supply fearsDepartment​​ of Economy slammed over Covid spend PremiumEpidemic Belfast: Podcast takes a scalpel to our medical pastCost of living crisis leads to .% slump in retail footfallMost ReadPO Ferries confirm  staff have been made redundant after firm made £m lossBBC’s Emma Vardy is on the crest of a wave... and set to tie the knot at Co Antrim fairytale castleSt Patrick’s Day: Rare ‘blood rain’ could be set for Northern Ireland thanks to Storm CeliaHome heating oil price in Northern Ireland drops by .% but Consumer Council warns it could be short-livedFlybe selects Belfast City Airport as its second base of operations in UKTop VideosPlayPO Ferries ‘unable to run services’ due to upcoming company announcementPlayVideo: St Patrick#s day parade in BelfastPlayWhat#s the craic  Tourists in Dublin make hilarious effort to impersonate Irish accents and phrases for St Patrick#s DayLatest PoliticsNew Belfast council chief John Walsh will earn up to £k a yearMLA seeks to investigate recent surge in fuel prices amid Kilroot Power Station confusionAlex KaneOpinionDisagreements are only going to grow as unionism heads into election in fractured stateNorthern Ireland births, deaths and marriages can now be registered in IrishMLAs who tried to cut rents will actually force them up, claims estate agents’ bodyLatestSturgeon tells PO Ferries boss of ‘utter disgust’ after  workers sackedImpostor posing as Ukrainian PM calls Defence SecretaryWatch: Channel  releases first look at final series of Derry GirlsAngela Rayner tells of distress over abusive messages after David Amess deathUnions threaten legal action over ‘shameful’ sacking of PO workers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is a long journey.“I think when people think about normal le, they think about the le that they led before and, sadly, to some extent, that is not possible.“You can’t go back to that because both you as a hostage and your family have been changed quite a lot by the experience.”Ms Symons said every hostage has dferent obstacles to overcome after leaving captivity, but in regards to high-profile cases, media attention will be one of the biggest struggles.The moment Richard, Nazanin and Gabriella finally reunited after  long years. This picture makes me so happy and so proud of all  of my brave constituents. Thank you everyone for your constant support for this incredible family. #NazaninIsFree pic KZYMtFEA— Tulip SiddiqMarch , “Obviously, people have been following some of these hostage cases for years and they feel, you know, part of it and it’s something they want to hear about,” she said.“But the families and the ing hostages do need time and space just to be alone and try to take stock of what’s happened and learn to be with each other again.”It is also harder for high-profile cases to dissociate themselves from “the badge of being a former hostage”, but some choose to embrace it to raise awareness on the topic, she added.Ms Symons said being a hostage can lead to people “changing their priorities in le” as they find joy in the small things, which include having a meal with their families.In the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, one of her requests was for her husband to make her a cup of tea, while Mr Ashoori wanted a beer.One of the founders of Hostage International, Terry Waite, was kidnapped by Hezbollah in Lebanon, while he was serving as the then-Archbishop of Canterbury’s envoy in .“He is a man of immense compassion and he’s brought that to the organisation… just wanting to help people who are going through dficulties and using his own experience of having been through it himself – that is what Hostage International is about, ” Ms Symons said.Speaking on Tonight with Andrew Marr on LBC, Mr Waite said he had spoken to Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe about dealing with le after captivity.He said: “I said, ‘Nazanin, when you come out, take it asyou are coming up from the seabed.

They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe.

Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished monument..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Council set to review museum joint curator restructure role  ","story":"THE controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Fin tasic with formation of new angling club  ","story":"A NEW course angling club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

The funding provided by the Department means it will be assisting Downpatrick in a very substantive way over the next few years.ldquoThe planning has been completed. The next stage is to get things done. I know the partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors which has developed here will moved forward to a successful conclusion and soon we will all see a major improvement in the appearance and le of Downpatrick, added the Minister.A new town centre plan was unveiled at the conference, together with a design guide to compliment the objectives of the Downpatrick conservation area.DUNDRUM ndash Pupils at two Dundrum schools, damaged by fire just before Christmas, have benefited from the Down Leisure Centrersquos annual fund-raising drive.Downshire and the Sacred Heart primary schools are the recipients of pound, which will go towards replacing equipment which was destroyed in two malicious fires in December.The money represents a record total of all leisure centre staff who organise a charity event each year. Past beneficiaries include Children in Need, the Ethiopian Appeal and local children who received toys.This yearrsquos total is a record figure for the centre staff who used their spare time to organised a sponsored swim for the schools.Both schools attended the centrersquos Schools Swimming Programme together and when the teachers and the young children related their plight to the swimming teachers the staff decided to help.The result was an organised sponsored swim with all the schools in the swimming programme taking part and all raising money.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen.

Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

show.They danced a sultry tango to Rio by Duran Duran with judge Arthur Gourounlian commenting after: ldquoMatthew, you brought the passion of Rio to the dance floor tonight.Fellow judge Brian Redmond said: ldquoYou started with intensity, commitment to the movement... its just the face thats missing at this stage, your body brought us on the journey.Loraine Barry, another judge, said: ldquoI like this Matthew, I felt you got yourself in the correct tango position.They scored  from the judges but they picked up extra points in the team dance for their group,Turkish Delights, were victorious.These points, combined with the public, kept Matthew safe from the dance-off.Nicolas Roche became the latest celebrity to exit as he and dance partner Karen Byrne lost out in this weeks

about.However, everyone -mdash including the DWTS judges mdash have noticed a certain spark between him and Laura.ldquoWersquove really grown close, admitted Matthew. ldquoI think with dancing, when yoursquore in this process, itrsquos so intense and yoursquore in each otherrsquos pockets for seven days a week and you become emotionally reliant on the person and vice versa.ldquoIt really is so intense and there is a lot of pressure because yoursquove got the whole nation watching you and yoursquove got the producers and your fellow contestants watching and you donrsquot want to let the

I had no expectation coming into it.\"I was never a performer, never danced in my le so it was a whole new world. Going into the show Irsquom rsquo \" so I never expected myself to be a good dancer, Irsquom not saying Irsquom a good dancer now but Irsquove definitely improved leaps and bounds since I started.ldquoIrsquom really buzzing at how far Irsquove progressed and hopefully Irsquoll keep that going and improve further from here.He said that he has found the physical demands of dance quite challenging and that his body is breaking down now.ldquoItrsquos constant because yoursquore twisting your body in new ways.

The practice has recognised both the need for change, and the opportunity that new ways of working provides to improve the quality of care which it can offer to its patients.ldquoShe is an outstanding example of the dedication and professionalism of our GP services.The minister also thanked all of the practice staff or their ldquotireless and ongoing treatment, care and support that they provide to patients, particularly over the past two years.He added: ldquoI know it has not been easy. This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in . She replaced Dr Ronald Hamilton.Dr Smith said that while she is looking forward to having some time to spend with her family and to travel, she will greatly miss her patients and all the practice staff.ldquoItrsquos been a very exciting, go-ahead practice to be part of and our list has more than doubled since I joined, she said.ldquoItrsquos a lovely team to work with and I will miss all my colleagues and staff terribly after I go, particularly after Covid when our le was so restricted at home.ldquoThe last two years have been quite bizarre in many ways the team has really come together. This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives.

It is little surprise that workers are concerned that their pay packets may not be sufficient in this time of soaring prices.One alarming aspect of this current monetary headache is that one of the traditional levers of control of inflation is rendered almost redundant at this time — rising interest rates. Only weeks ago a gradual such increase was expected, indeed assumed, to be happening over the coming months. But such a move would be so unpalatable as to be almost impossible in the context of burdened families grappling with devastating fuel bills.No-one wants lectures on pay restraint from Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, given that he earns £, a year. But it is not unreasonable to be concerned that across-the-board high pay rises could lead to a s-style spiral. High inflation, among other things, will decimate cash savings.There are urgent measures that can be done to help families such as scrapping VAT on energy billsand encouraging those who can work from home to do so, to save on their fuel expense.

She is a member of GSD Dog Club of Wales Training Club and receives support from professional mentors.Luca, who also qualied for Crufts  but failed the last challenge, was unstoppable in this years event - winning the competition and being awarded a trophy.“It’s a long process to qualy for Crufts,” said husband Mr Heath.“This is the second time Luca has qualied and he nailed everything this year.“He came in first place and was asked to stay behind to do a demonstration in the ring – we are really happy.“It was a long day, but worthwhile.”The trio travelled from Wenvoe and stayed at a bed and breakfast ahead of the event so Luca could have his time to shine in the prestigious competition.“I was the most nervous watching the final exercise,” added Mr Heath.“Carolyn doesn’t look at the score as she doesn’t want the pressure so – although she knew she was doing well – she didn’t know that she was winning.”Although the trio had to head back to Wenvoe after the competition, Mr Heath had anticipated the day would go well so had a bottle ready – meaning Ms Heath could enjoy a celebratory bubbly on their travels.Due to Luca’s success in Crufts  he has automatically qualied for the event in .And –all goes as planned – it is hoped that Luca and his female friend Eva, will be welcoming puppies into the world later this year and that Eva will qualy for Crufts in a few years time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMr Macron spoke at a press conference that was his first major campaign event – taking time off from his focus on the war in Ukraine to provide details about his vision for the next five years.He vowed to push ahead with a controversial pension reform that would “progressively” raise the retirement age from  to , and suggested that people who start working at a young age would still be able to retire before .Boosting France’s growth must go through “investing more” and “working more”, Mr Macron added, vowing to achieve “full employment”. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron arrives on stage for a presidential campaign news conference in Aubervilliers, north of Paris The unemployment rate recently reached .%, down from more than % when he came into power.Mr Macron also promised to keep investing in the French military, and fight inequalities at school and in healthcare access, amid other proposals.Asked about his campaign’s motto, he said he wants the French to be “stronger and happier all together”.Even though he formally announced he is running for a second term at the beginning of the month, Mr Macron has not held any rallies yet.He has been criticised by other candidates for refusing to take part in any televised debate before the first voting round, scheduled on April .In recent days, he pushed for a ceasefire in Ukraine during phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and spoke on an almost daily basis with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.Last week, he gathered EU leaders at the Versailles palace, west of Paris, to discuss sanctions against Russia.France holds the rotating presidency of the European Union Council, which gives Mr Macron a key role in co-ordinating the bloc of ’s response..remove vw,vw,px, px\"Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech Next week, he is expected to be seen alongside US President Joe Biden at Nato’s summit in Brussels.Mr Macron recently released unusual pictures of himself working nights and weekends at the Elysee Palace, looking tired and unshaven, in jeans and a hoodie.If that is part of a campaign strategy it seems to be paying off, reinforcing his position as frontrunner in the race while making it dficult for other contenders to challenge him.Pollster Bernard Sananes, president of poll institute Elabe, said that “obviously the international situation is reinforcing his stature”.“It gives the impression that Macron in  has been elected on a promise to renewand that Macron in  wants to be elected on the promise ofexperience,” he said in an interview with French newspaper L’Opinion.Polls show most French, whether they intend to vote for him or not, consider he is up to the job, he stressed.Polls see Mr Macron about  percentage points ahead of far-right contender Marine Le Pen, placing them both in a position to reach the run-off and replay the  election.They show that in that case the French president is widely expected to win. vw,vw,px, px\"The French president is ahead in the polls Another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, far-left figure Jean-Luc Melenchon, and conservative contender Valerie Pecresse are among the other challengers.Rivals have accused Mr Macron of focusing on Ukraine to avoid domestic issues which may prove more tricky for him.Ms Le Pen said Mr Macron is “using the war in Ukraine to scare French people, because he thinks scaring can benefit him”.“When there’s a war, there’s a reflex to be legitimist,” Ms Pecresse said.“People think: there’s a captain leading the operation … We must not be afraid to change the captain on April ,” she added.Advocates for Mr Macron argue that the situation in Ukraine involves key domestic issues that are being fully debated in the campaign, such as energy and defence policies.Political history expert Jean Garrigues stressed the “unying” impact around the head of state in a war-related situation.“We can see that Macron’s adversaries have no experience equivalent to the presidential , or even as key ministers, and are de facto in a situation of inferiority,” he noted. vw,vw,px, px\"French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech Pollsters said Mr Macron’s greatest challenge as the frontrunner may be a low turnout, with sympathisers not going to polling stations because they think he will win, while those angry at his policies would further mobilise.Mr Macron himself acknowledged the risk in a behind-the-scenes video posted on his campaign’s YouTube channel.“That’s what I’m going to tell the French, and also my supporters: If they think it’s done, it means we have lost,” he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga,

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLara Symons, , chief executive of charity Hostage International, spoke to the PA news agency about some of the struggles the British-Iranian mother-of-one may face after six years in detention in Iran.The charity worker was reunited with her husband Richard Ratclfe and their seven-year-old daughter Gabriella on Thursday, having been released along with fellow dual-national Anoosheh Ashoori after Britain agreed to settle a £ million debt from the s. vw, px\"Lara Symons said every hostage faces dferent obstacles after leaving captivity Ms Symons said Hostage International has helped many “trauma hostages”, adding: “From that experience, we’ve learnt that this is a new journey. This is a long journey.“I think when people think about normal le, they think about the le that they led before and, sadly, to some extent, that is not possible.“You can’t go back to that because both you as a hostage and your family have been changed quite a lot by the experience.”Ms Symons said every hostage has dferent obstacles to overcome after leaving captivity, but in regards to high-profile cases, media attention will be one of the biggest struggles.The moment Richard, Nazanin and Gabriella finally reunited after  long years. This picture makes me so happy and so proud of all  of my brave constituents. Thank you everyone for your constant support for this incredible family. #NazaninIsFree pic KZYMtFEA— Tulip SiddiqMarch , “Obviously, people have been following some of these hostage cases for years and they feel, you know, part of it and it’s something they want to hear about,” she said.“But the families and the ing hostages do need time and space just to be alone and try to take stock of what’s happened and learn to be with each other again.”.removeIt is also harder for high-profile cases to dissociate themselves from “the badge of being a former hostage”, but some choose to embrace it to raise awareness on the topic, she added.Ms Symons said being a hostage can lead to people “changing their priorities in le” as they find joy in the small things, which include having a meal with their families.In the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, one of her requests was for her husband to make her a cup of tea, while Mr Ashoori wanted a beer.One of the founders of Hostage International, Terry Waite, was kidnapped by Hezbollah in Lebanon, while he was serving as the then-Archbishop of Canterbury’s envoy in .“He is a man of immense compassion and he’s brought that to the organisation… just wanting to help people who are going through dficulties and using his own experience of having been through it himself – that is what Hostage International is about, ” Ms Symons said.Speaking on Tonight with Andrew Marr on LBC, Mr Waite said he had spoken to Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe about dealing with le after captivity.He said: “I said, ‘Nazanin, when you come out, take it asyou are coming up from the seabed. If you come up too quickly you will get nitrogen in the blood and you will become seriously ill.“‘If you come up gently, one step at a time, then you will be fine. Make your statement to the press, get that off your chest, then go and meet with the family and then go away from all the enormous pressure that will be on her at this time.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Hostages like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe  uface long journey to normality u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
