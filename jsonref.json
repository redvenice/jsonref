I guess it hurt enough for me to remember 60 years later\u0027.\u0027According to Simon, people thought Garfunkel was the one who wrote the songs, not him, because he \u0027looks like he writes the songs\u0027.Simon said: \u0027It came up all the time. There is a prejudice against small men and that has been a problem at times because I happen to be a sort of alpha male-ish type guy. It becomes a competitive thing.\u0027There\u0027s this attitude that \u0027I\u0027m taller, so I could beat you up, or I should be in charge\u0027.          By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027. Simon and Jagger are pictured above in 1989Eventually, when he was in his 40s, Simon said to himself: \u0027Listen man, if you\u0027re going to make a big issue out of what you don\u0027t have, you\u0027re taking your actual gifts for granted….that\u0027s the hand I\u0027ve been dealt with. That\u0027s the way I\u0027m going to play it\u0027.Elsewhere in the book Simon talks about how his height was bound up in his long running mental health issues.In 1981 he went to see Los Angeles psychiatrist Rod Gorney and told him he was so unhappy he couldn\u0027t write songs anymore.Hilburn quotes an interview with Simon from 1984 in which he says that from the outside people could not understand why he was depressed, but inside he was looking at the \u0027thin slice of the pie that has got the bad news in it\u0027.What he meant by bad news: \u0027being short\u0027, his voice and his relationships.Simon said that his issues left him \u0027unable to absorb the bounty that was in my life\u0027 and he used to joke that he would happily pay $5 million to look like his hero Elvis Presley, who was 6ft 2in tall.Simon, 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees.But his dream died because of something that Hiburn says would \u0027haunt him for years: his size\u0027. By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027.          Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade. They attended the same high school and began to play music together. The pair are pictured together in 1957          Simon (right with Garfunkel), 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees. But his dream died because of his small statureSimon said: \u0027That\u0027s what rock\u0027n\u0027roll was, and it was a really big thing with me.\u0027I once had this conversation with John Lennon, and he really wanted to know how I knew enough to keep my own publishing rather than give half of it away like the Beatles did. I told him I grew up around the music business....then I asked him: \u0027Who ever told you how to comb your hair like that?\u0027\u0027Much of \u0027The Life\u0027 is taken up with the love-hate - mostly hate - relationship between Simon and Garfunkel.Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade.They attended the same high school and began to play music together. Their first single was an R\u0026ampB number titled, \u0027Sh-Boom\u0027 in 1954. And even before they turned 18, the boys were being played on national radio. In 1957, however, they suffered a split that \u0027caused a wound so deep in Art it would never heal fully\u0027.Sid Prosen, the owner of the record label called Big which signed them, asked Simon if he could record some songs on his own and \u0027caught up in the excitement of the moment\u0027, Simon agreed.Hilburn writes that their \u0027massive mistake\u0027 was not telling Garfunkel who knew he had a great voice but was \u0027dependent on Paul for songs, which meant Paul had all the power\u0027.Garfunkel \u0027always felt in danger of being tossed aside\u0027, the book says. Simon\u0027s song flopped as did their next collaborative project and the pair went their separate ways for five years. Tank tops, flock wallpaper and a cheese plant in the corner:...\u0027She just wanted to know that he\u0027s in jail\u0027: Patton Oswalt...Share this article    Simon and Garfunkel, pictured above in 1993, have long had a love-hate relationship with each other. The biggest blow up came in 1993, when Simon\u0027s business manager had to to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.They would go through the same cycle for the next 50 years reconciliation and fighting before breaking up once more. The biggest blow up came in 1993. Simon and Garfunkel had reunited for a series of shows in New York called Event of a Lifetime that sold out so fast they added 14 more nights to the ten-night run.But the old tensions came back straight away, and Joseph Rascoff, Simon\u0027s business manager, had to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.He said: \u0027I genuinely believed that if there had been a knife on the table, one of them would have used it\u0027.At one point Garfunkel accused Simon of getting a journalist to write a negative review of one of the sets.On another night, while playing their hit \u0027The Boxer\u0027, Garfunkel suddenly stopped singing, which Simon thought was a mistake. But after the show Garfunkel told him: \u0027I didn\u0027t forget. I just wanted you to see what it feels like to be made a fool of\u0027.The two men went at each other and, recounting the episode, Rascoff said: \u0027They never came to blows but there was shoving, and I had to step between them\u0027.Simon described the incident as \u0027ugly - the most vicious fight, verbally at least, I\u0027d had in my life\u0027.Simon ided opinion among those who met him and a veteran from the British club scene in the 1960s called him \u0027shy, arrogant, self-assured, ruthlessly determined\u0027.           Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974. He\u0027s pictured above, second from left, with Garfunkel (left), Yoko Ono (second right)  and Lennon in 1974Other said that he was so obsessed with music that human relationships came second.Joan Bata, a friend of his first girlfriend Kathy Chitty, said: \u0027He wasn\u0027t deliberately being hurtful. It was just that his mind was totally occupied with something else.\u0027The most striking breakup was with his first wife Peggy which is described with brutal starkness in the book.In 1974 the couple were due to go to their home in New Hope, Connecticut, but Simon was listening to his competition in that years\u0027 Grammy Awards, Stevie Wonder\u0027s Innervisions.Peggy called him to join her but he was too caught up in the music so she called him again and he became angry, thinking to himself: \u0027Can\u0027t I even listen to music any more?\u0027          Robert Hilburn\u0027s biography, Paul Simon: The Life, is out on May 8 on Simon \u0026amp SchusterAs the book puts it: \u0027When Peggy called out a third time, the marriage was over\u0027. Simon simply walked out of their townhouse and moved into the Stanhope Hotel around the corner until their orce was finalized.In the book, Simon said: \u0027Ultimately I wasn\u0027t ready for marriage. The marriage didn\u0027t solve the loneliness. I knew right away I had made a mistake. \u0027I didn\u0027t know how to be a good companion. I wasn\u0027t a very mature person. I didn\u0027t understand you had to work at problems. I wanted the marriage to solve my problems.\u0027\u0027The Life\u0027 says that Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974.Lennon was constantly drunk and when Simon started to play acoustic guitar on \u0027Rock Island Line\u0027 before Lennon wanted he repeatedly told him to stop.Then Lennon started to reach over and mute Simon\u0027s guitar strings with his hand. A frustrated Simon told him: \u0027John, I play guitar too.\u0027May Pang, who was staying with Lennon at the time, said that Lennon was annoyed by Simon because \u0027unlike almost everybody else who entered John\u0027s orbit (Simon) had a powerful sense of himself and could actually refuse to be treated badly\u0027.In 2002 Simon was in Washington to receive a Kennedy Center Honor to receive an award for his lifetime of achievement to American culture through the performing arts.As he sat next to Elizabeth Taylor they watched as Alicia Keys butchered Bridge Over Troubled Water.Taylor leaned over to Simon and said: \u0027Tell me, Paul, does it upset you when somebody f**** up one of your songs?\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/11/4BBA3A3A00000578-5677643-image-a-67_1525168992638.jpg","title":"Eugenie fianc living door Harry Meghan","story":"Princess Eugenie and fiance Jack Brooksbank, left, have moved into Kensington Palace and now live just yards away from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, right.

For the most part, the mountains of Korea mean identity to them. There\u0027s typically a human story attached to it like my great grandfather came from that area and always talked about that mountain. This has much more impact when that grandfather or mother was born on the other side of the border they can no longer cross.\u0027Mr Shepherd said it was the abundance of the mountains that first caught his eye.    \u0027At first, it was their abundance and shapes that intrigued me,\u0027 he said.

So when you stand on a ridge, you look out over waves and waves of more ridges, and when the light hits them, it can have an impressive effect, like looking at broken layers of paint.\u0027Then when I walked the Baekdu Daegan ridge (687km) in South Korea and wrote a guidebook about that. I started to discover this other world of Korea\u0027s mountains. \u0027They contained a deep history of fairy tales, mythologies, animistic religions, culture, foods, arts, and literature, all stemmed on mountains. \u0027In this busy Korean world, they had this ancient influence from their mountains, which they were all understandably born of.\u0027 Mr Shepherd is planning to release a book about his work on the Baekdu Daegan containing photos of the amazing scenery, as well as the villages and its people.He recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the release, which will also include essays on the Baekdu Daegan.

I would like to see a two-country one-nation system slowly developed. The border reduced from fortified to crossable, and then some mixture and development via exchange.\u0027We could end up seeing a new political direction for Korea. An emergence of both a socialist and capitalist system. \u0027Koreans are talented people with a will to do it their way, given a chance. There are also willing and keen to adapt and take on all technologies and global ideas. They can set an example.          Mr Shepherd hopes that with both North and South Korea in negotiations over bringing peace to the peninsula that the Baekdu Daegan can became a symbol of unification.

She added: \u0027It\u0027s living a nightmare that you never wake up from.\u0027Nearly 37 years ago we became members of an exclusive club we didn\u0027t ask for membership of — we became parents of a missing daughter. \u0027I would dearly love to be able to revoke that membership.\u0027          Investigators believe Katrice, who had been shopping with her mother when she disappeared, may still be alive having been abducted but have little memory of her early years          British soldiers are searching an area near a riverbank in northwest Germany as they hunt for missing Katrice Lee          German Police help British Royal Military police in their search for missing Katrice Lee           The Royal Military Police is carrying out a five-week excavation of the banks of the River Alme in PaderbornShe told The Sun: \u0027The next five weeks is a double-edged sword for us as a family. We desperately want Katrice to be found but we also know that if anything is discovered during this search then my daughter\u0027s life would have been ended in very unsavoury circumstances.\u0027That\u0027s another emotion we have to learn to live with.\u0027 The case was reopened in 2000 and led to the arrest of a former soldier. But he was released without charge and the case closed again after three years. There were further inquiries in 2012 when Royal Military Police chiefs admitted mistakes were made during the initial investigation.  Katrice went missing on 28 November 1981 - her second birthday - while out shopping with her mother Sharon          Katrice Lee was snatched from a supermarket while out shopping with her mother (pictured)          Sharon and Richard Lee, the parents of Katrice, who are desperately hoping the search will find what happened to their daughter          Katrice\u0027s mother Sharon, now 64, said the toddler was \u0027gone in a matter of seconds\u0027The RMP announced on Monday that it would be carrying out a dig on the River Alme\u0027s banksat Paderborner Str, Paderborn.It followed a reanalysis of evidence gathered during the original investigation, which pinpointed the river as an area of interest, the force said.The \u0027detailed excavation\u0027 of the site is expected to last around five weeks. Senior investigating officer Richard O\u0027Leary, of the RMP, said: \u0027The aim of the search is to find evidence that could finally shed light on what happened to Katrice.\u0027  A man was seen climbing into a green saloon with a child matching Katrice\u0027s description (pictured: the photo-fit of the man)He renewed an appeal for information about a man seen at the shopping centre placing a child matching the toddler\u0027s description into a green saloon car.\u0027A green saloon car was also seen on the River Alme Bridge near the NAAFI the day after Katrice disappeared. It may or may not be the same car, but we are very keen to identify this car,\u0027 he added.A photo-fit of the man has been reissued as part of the fresh appeal.Anyone from the Paderborn area who owned such a car at the time is asked to approach police so they can be ruled out of the inquiry.But the possibility remains that Katrice is still alive – now aged 38 – having been abducted and raised with little memory of her early years, investigators believe.  This is what police believe Katrice would look like today - she went missing in November 1981She was born with a distinctive eye condition in her left eye which would have required two medical operations to correct.Mr O\u0027Leary said: \u0027An age progression image of what Katrice may look like now, aged 38, has been produced.\u0027If anyone feels they know someone who looks like this, or believes they could be Katrice, then we would encourage them to come forward.\u0027Katrice\u0027s father Richard, now 68, who has split from Sharon, had criticised the RMP handling of the case, but felt his voice had \u0027finally been heard\u0027 at a summit with Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson this year.     A hundred British soldiers will spend five weeks on a forensic excavation of the banks of the river Alme in Germany           Police are investigating the site near to where two-year-old Katrice was last seen           The latest investigation is considering the theory that the toddler was abducted and possibly taken to the River Alme          Katrice Lee vanished on 28 November 1981, her second birthday, as her mother was buying treats for a birthday teaHe said, during the initial investigation, border guards were not informed when Katrice disappeared, statements from shop workers were not taken until six weeks later and information about an eye condition Katrice had was not made known. He added: \u0027Hopefully, we can resolve issues and find out where my daughter is.\u0027  Mr Williamson said Katrice\u0027s case was heart-wrenching, adding: \u0027The disappearance of a child is every parent’s worst nightmare and I have been struck by the courage and dignity of the Lee family who have never given up on their search for Katrice.\u0027As this major dig gets under way, the efforts and expertise of the Royal Military Police are behind the family.\u0027Anyone with information for the Operation Bute team, should call the UK helpline on 0800 616888 or the Germany helpline on 0800 184 2222.

He spent a month photographing the country and then returned to the US on several other trips. In this picture, Mr Carnicelli captured a young boy in Chicago leaning against a signpost at the moment a green bus marked \u0027INDIANA\u0027 passes by in 1966          When Mr Carnicelli (pictured in New York in 1966) returned to Italy after his first trip to the US, he showcased his photographs in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027          His new book says he named that exhibition  because he \u0027felt almost like an intruder in a society completely new to him\u0027. A group of construction workers are pictured giving directions in New York in 1966          He went on to become a freelance photojournalist who worked with several Italian newspapers and magazines and traveled around the world until he retired from photography in the early 1970s.  A retired trade union worker is pictured in Detroit in 1966    Mr Carnicelli (pictured today) tells DailyMail.com that he \u0027felt as if I were living in another dimension\u0027 when he first visited the US in 1966. \u0027I was captivated by the carefree spirit and the freedom that America offered with its mix of cultures and traditions,\u0027 he saysHe adds: \u0027America is a state of mind. Telling it is easy and difficult at the same time. Behind that opulent face, it has many others all of them true, all of them deeply meaningful.\u0027 The images also showed the sadness and loneliness juxtaposed with the American Dream from his European perspective. He realized America was far more complex than he had expected and, when he returned to Italy, Mr Carnicelli showcased the images in an exhibition in Milan titled \u0027I\u0027m sorry, America\u0027. His book says he felt he was trespassing in a place that was unfamiliar to him.\u0027Looking back now, it was as if I wanted to apologize for what I had recorded as a photographer,\u0027 Mr Carnicelli says. \u0027I did feel like an intruder investigating a new society at that time.\u0027After that first trip to the US, he returned to the US several times and photographed cities including New York, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, Dallas and San Francisco.He was able to capture men resting against a wall as they wait in line at a job center in Chicago, a man selling newspapers in New York, a trade union worker wearing a colorful hat and jewelry in Detroit, the impatient looks of people in phone booths at O\u0027Hare International Airport in Chicago, people resting on benches at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC and Neo-Nazis demonstrating in Dallas.\u0027The images come very naturally,\u0027 he says. \u0027I did not have to look for them, they just showed up.\u0027            Mr Carnicelli had decided to put his camera down to open his own photography business, where he developed and printed photos in Florence. This schoolboy was photographed by Mr Carnicelli in 1966 in New York          While he worked on his business, Mr Carnicelli\u0027s own photographs ended up being stored in his cellar for 50 years before they were rediscovered last year. Men are pictured leaning against a wall and waiting in line at a job center in Chicago in 1966          He closed his store back in 2010 and asked curator Bärbel Reinhard to look at the negatives he had tucked away. As she looked through the images, she found thousands of images from the \u002760s and \u002770s, including the ones he took of the US - including this photo, showing people walking past the South Pacific Restaurant on an evening in Chicago in 1966          His photographs from his visits to the US are being published for the first time this month in a new book, American Voyage. A black \u002767 Plymouth Belvedere is pictured in Brooklyn in 1967Mr Carnicelli\u0027s family ran a photography equipment business when he was growing up, so it wasn\u0027t a surprise that he started taking photographs himself. He went on to work as a freelance photojournalist for Italian newspapers and magazines including Panorama, Corriere della Sera and Il Giorno.He traveled around the world for his work and even had several exhibitions of his work in the \u002760s and \u002770s. However, by the early 1970s, he decided to retire from photography and open a photo development and printing business in Florence, following in his family\u0027s footsteps.Thousands of his photographs, including those he took on his visits to the US, were stored away in his cellar and forgotten for 50 years until they were rediscovered by curator Bärbel Reinhard last year. Mr Carnicelli had asked her, when he closed his shop, to look at his old negatives - eventually leading her to his captivating images from Ameica.From snake charmers and leaping tigers to killer elephants...Lost moments, rediscovered: Rolls of decades-old forgotten...Legends of a lost era: Retro photos re-emerge of Rock and...The Baptist minister\u0027s son, 14, who turned into the Wild...Share this article\u0027In his cellar lay a hidden treasure, a foreign and fascinating world in black and white but also in exquisite color images, hundreds of stories and microstories of the sixties and seventies mostly set in Italy, but also in America,\u0027 Reinhard says in the book.Now those images are being published and exhibited once again.\u0027I think the photos being published now gives them a particular flavor and a different perspective compared to when I took them half a century ago,\u0027 he says. \u0027I do not fool myself into thinking that people learn from my photographs. This is not possible. Photography is subjective, the image does not belong to who takes it, it belongs to the viewer who gives it their own interpretation.\u0027American Voyage, published by Reel Art Press, will be released this month. An accompanying exhibition at the David Hill Gallery in London opened on April 20 and will run through June 8.          According to The Guardian, Mr Carnicelli took this photograph of a man in front of a shop window displaying nurses\u0027 uniforms just outside New York. The outlet reported that Mr Carnicelli had been intrigued by the mannequins when the man walked by          An exhibition to accompany Mr Carnicelli\u0027s new book opened on April 20 and will run through June 8. Two fashion students are pictured walking past construction in New York in 1966          During his career as a photographer in the \u002760s and \u002770s, Mr Carnicelli had several exhibitions for his work in the Milan, Bologna and Florence and Prague.

The incident that happened two weeks ago was caused by an exploding engine           The Chicago flight was on its way to Newark when it erted to Cleveland on WednesdaySince only the outer pane broke, the cabin didn\u0027t lose pressurization and the flight landed without issue or any injuries. Windows on commercial planes typically have three panes - outer, middle and inner - made of acrylic and glass.The fact that just the outer pane broke is evidence that the window was acting as designed. In fact, it\u0027s that little hole at the bottom of the outside pane that regulates how much pressure from the cabin is exerted onto the window and makes sure that if the window is going to break - the outer pane goes first.\u0027The way they are designed, the window performed, the backup function worked as intended,\u0027 former National Transportation Safety Board member Richard Healing told Bloomberg. \u0027My suspicion is it was the outside part but the frame held and kept it in place. It performed as intended.\u0027  Healing went on to say that passenger windows cracking is very rare and it\u0027s actually more common for cockpit windows to break.\u0027My sense is that its very rare for a cabin window to have that issue,\u0027 Healing, who now leads Air Safety Engineering, said. Patrick Smith, the pilot behind AskThePilot.com, told DailyMail.com that Wednesday\u0027s incident doesn\u0027t seem serious, and that it was probably only in the news because of the deadly accident two weeks ago.\u0027It appears that one layer of the inner window pane failed for some reason. It’s hard to say why at this point, but the result was nothing serious.\u0027If not for the fatality on board the Southwest flight a couple of weeks ago, it’s unlikely we’d be talking about this at all. The two incidents are completely unrelated, and this latest one is particularly minor,\u0027 Smith said. The plastic pane on the inside of the plane is to prevent passengers from getting access to the glass panes in the middle and on the outside.There is a middle pane of glass with a hole in it, then an air gap, followed by an outside pane of glass.This hole helps maintain the pressure differential and directs it onto the outer pane rather than the inner pane.          There are multiple layers of pane in each aircraft window in this case it was the outside pane which broke, a sign, says Richard Healing, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, that it was designed correctly          A patent (illustrated) filed by Daimlerchrysler Aerospace Airbus in 1997 explained this \u0027air conduit\u0027 helps maintain \u0027external atmospheric pressure inside\u0027 the panes. If all the panes were sealed, and didn\u0027t have holes, the pressure in the cabin would act on the inside pane of glass and there would be no failsafe if it cracked          The little hole at the bottom of the outside pane (stock image) regulates how much pressure from the cabin is exerted onto the window and makes sure that if the window is going to break - the outer pane goes first, which is what happened in this caseDespite the assurances from experts, passengers were nonetheless terrified.Linda Holley texted her son that the window broke and caused a \u0027loud noise\u0027.

This was not just because of the Scotsman\u0027s huge 6ft 2in frame or his dour, commanding demeanour — he was, after all, merely a group captain.The top brass gave this 43-year-old physicist their full attention because what he had to say on the morning of Monday, June 5, 1944, would affect the lives of millions across Europe.The military leaders assembled in the map room in Southwick House — a vast Georgian-style mansion near Portsmouth — really were the top brass. It was there the most senior Allied commanders, including General Dwight Eisenhower, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, Air Marshals Arthur Tedder and Trafford Leigh-Mallory, and Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, had gathered to launch D-Day.At their disposal was the mightiest invasion force the world has ever seen, including three million men, more than 1,200 warships, some 2,500 landing craft and 13,100 aircraft.Despite this immense power, these men were unable to control one vital element in their plans — the weather.The man most able to do so was Stagg, the chief meteorological adviser to Operation Overlord. It was his unenviable job to study the conflicting predictions given by three separate forecasting units, then to advise Eisenhower with one, unambiguous forecast.Outside the room, an unseasonable storm was battering the windows.It was because of that storm that D-Day was not launched on June 5 as planned.

General Eisenhower looked at Stagg. \u0027All right, Stagg,\u0027 said the American. \u0027What have you got for us this time?\u0027 Stagg cleared his throat and began.The story of how he and the teams under his command came to forecast the weather for one of the most pivotal events in history is the subject of a play by the award-winning actor David Haig.Opening at the Ambassadors Theatre in London\u0027s West End on — appropriately enough — June 6, Pressure tells how Stagg coped with the most extraordinary persuasion, coercion and intimidation to come up with the \u0027right\u0027 forecast, and how he had to battle the American forecasters, who were adamant that June 5 would have been fine to launch Overlord.The play is aptly named as Stagg not only, of course, had to study pressure charts, but he truly was under the most intolerable pressure.If his forecast for June 6 was wrong, and the invasion floundered in a storm, D-Day would fail.           Allied soldiers rush across the beach as the invasion begins on June 6 - on a clear day as Bragg predicted          British LCT\u0027s line the Normandy shore, each with a barrage balloon designed to discourage enemy air attackThat would not only mean the deaths of thousands of troops drowning in landing craft unsuitable for stormy waters, but also that the Nazis would continue to occupy Europe for years to come.The fate of the war — and indeed European civilisation — weighed heavily on Stagg\u0027s shoulders.For a man given so much influence, he came from a very modest background.Born in June 1900 and brought up in a small, stone terraced house in Dalkeith near Edinburgh, Stagg\u0027s father was a plumber and his mother a seamstress.Deadly Nazi Tiger Tank with armour so thick shells bounced...Remembering those who fought and died for our freedom: Tens...Share this articleA bright boy, he went to Edinburgh University after a brief spell as a mechanic in the nascent Royal Flying Corps, and gained a top degree in natural philosophy.He then won a scholarship to enable him to take an MA, which he gained in mathematics and natural philosophy.When one considers Stagg\u0027s role during the war, it comes as a surprise to learn that he was not a trained meteorologist, a gap in his CV which was often held against him by his detractors.Nevertheless, Stagg had plenty of experience in meteorology, not least because he joined the Met Office in October 1923, at first as an assistant resident observer in Kew, West London.          The Coast Guard LCI(L)-85, battered by enemy fire after approaching Omaha Beach, prepares to evacuate the troops to the U.S.S. Samuel Chase.  She sank shortly after this photograph was taken.          Coasters unloading onto DUKW\u0027s (amphibious vehicles) after D-Day at an unidentified location in Normandy, northern FranceHowever, his primary academic interest was in geophysics and the effects of the earth\u0027s magnetic field. Diligent and managerial, Stagg climbed the professional ladder very quickly and, in 1931, he was given the immense responsibility of leading a British expedition to the Arctic to study magnetism and meteorology.By 1939, and with a doctorate under his belt, Stagg was appointed superintendent of the Kew Gardens Observatory, a role which he soon left with the outbreak of war.Posted to the Met Office HQ in Kingsway, Central London, he oversaw weather services for the army and liaised with the RAF.As John Ross says in his definitive book, Forecast For D-Day: \u0027It is obvious that among the senior officers of the Met Office, he was clearly well suited to fill the role of chief meteorologist for the planning of D-Day.\u0027 It was a role Stagg took up in 1943, and almost from the start he came under enormous pressure. Rather than employ one team of forecasters, the top brass decided there should be three teams, with two men in each. The teams were called Widewing, Dunstable and Admiralty.Stagg\u0027s job was to oversee all three and find commonality in their predictions in order to present a single and definitive forecast to his superiors.          Landing craft and a fleet of protection vessels approach the beach code-named Omaha on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Omaha Beach saw the roughest fighting and the most Allied losses of the four beaches assaulted that dayUnfortunately for him, the teams had very different methods of forecasting and, as a result, came up with very different results. It is important to remember that forecasting in the 1940s — without satellite imagery — was an extremely hit-and-miss affair and it was widely regarded that anything longer than a two-day forecast was not worth the paper it was written on.However, the two forecasters in Widewing, the Americans Irving P. Krick and Ben Holzman, felt they could produce long-range forecasts by using their \u0027analogue\u0027 method. This essentially compared current weather patterns with historical patterns, then forecast that the weather would turn out as it had done in the past.          All the commanders wanted to know was — could D-Day go ahead tomorrow, on June 6? General Dwight D Eisenhower (pictured) looked at Stagg. \u0027All right, Stagg,\u0027 said the American. \u0027What have you got for us this time?\u0027Today, no forecaster would set much store with such a method, as huge changes in weather patterns can be brought about by tiny variables.Even at the time, analogue forecasting was not regarded as reliable, but the self-promoting Krick had successfully managed to convince his superiors that it was.As a result, the relationship between the three teams was fractious, and Stagg had his work cut out not only harmonising forecasts but also smoothing the ruffled feathers of those who had produced them. He doesn\u0027t appear to have been that successful.\u0027We six never agreed about anything except that Stagg was not a good meteorologist and that he was a bit of a glory hound,\u0027 recalled Dr Lawrence Hogben, who worked for the Admiralty team. Matters came to a head on June 3, just 48 hours before D-Day was supposed to have taken place.While the American team predicted that the weather would be fine on the 5th, the other two teams were forecasting a storm.Krick fought hard to get the Dunstable team to change their minds, but they stuck firm and Stagg was able to tell Eisenhower he would have to delay the invasion — but that, crucially, there might be a break in the weather on June 6. The supreme commander found that his generals, admirals and air marshals had different opinions. Montgomery was keen to ignore the forecast and stick with June 5, while Tedder wanted to postpone.It was up to Eisenhower to make the decision. \u0027Weighing all the factors, I decided that the attackwould have to be postponed,\u0027 he recalled.Despite the American forecasters and Montgomery, Stagg had got his way and the storm did indeed come on the 5th.          After landing at the shore, these British troops wait for the signal to move forward from the beaches of Normandy          Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beach on D-DayAnd it was at 04:15 that morning that Stagg once more found himself in front of Eisenhower, and being asked if the mighty offensive could be mounted the following morning.After clearing his throat, Stagg began. \u0027Well, I\u0027ll give you some good news,\u0027 he said. \u0027Gentlemen, no substantial change has taken place since last time, but as I see it, the little that has changed is in the direction of optimism.\u0027As predicted, Stagg reckoned that there would be a break in the weather — enough to mount the invasion.General Eisenhower then said quietly, \u0027OK. Let\u0027s go.\u0027 \u0027No one present disagreed,\u0027 he recalled, \u0027and there was a definite brightening of faces.\u0027Unsurprisingly Stagg, like so many others, did not sleep well the night before D-Day.If his teams were wrong, then his forecast would result in perhaps the greatest military catastrophe ever.Had D-Day not taken place on June 6, the ships that were already at sea would have had to return to port to refuel.          American troops of the 4th Infantry Division (Famous Fourth) land on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, while Allied forces storm the Normandy beaches on D-DayAnd because of the timings of the tides, that would have seen D-Day delayed to June 19 — when there was a most extraordinary storm, which many meteorologists maintain would have been almost impossible to have forecast with the technology of the time. D-Day would have been a literal wash-out.But as dawn broke, Stagg was to be proved right. There was a break in the weather — and the rest is history.After the war, Stagg remained in meteorology and became director of services at the Meteorological Office until 1960.He was also president of the Royal Meteorological Society, although contrary to some reports, he was never knighted, but instead made a CB — a Companion of the Order of the Bath.He also received the U.S. Legion of Merit. He died in 1975, not long after publishing an account of his wartime experiences in 1971.Even today, meteorologists are ided over who really should take credit for the D-Day forecasts.Whatever the truth — and it is a tangled web to unweave — there can be no doubt that thanks to Stagg\u0027s leadership of a quarrelsome bunch of scientists, he presented his boss with the right answer. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/05/4BC0E99500000578-0-image-m-10_1525235760264.jpg","title":"Teenagers reliant iPhones read map","story":"Flight of imagination: Incredible footage shows 1,374...Share this articleHe added: ‘Maps are not only a joy in life – they’re also important to understand how space relates to other space.

I asked him if he remembered this mountain and his reply was \u0027all I can remember as a boy was many mountains\u0027.\u0027In the North, they finally get a chance to see photos of mountains they\u0027ve only ever heard about. For the most part, the mountains of Korea mean identity to them. There\u0027s typically a human story attached to it like my great grandfather came from that area and always talked about that mountain. This has much more impact when that grandfather or mother was born on the other side of the border they can no longer cross.\u0027Mr Shepherd said it was the abundance of the mountains that first caught his eye.    \u0027At first, it was their abundance and shapes that intrigued me,\u0027 he said.

So when you stand on a ridge, you look out over waves and waves of more ridges, and when the light hits them, it can have an impressive effect, like looking at broken layers of paint.\u0027Then when I walked the Baekdu Daegan ridge (687km) in South Korea and wrote a guidebook about that. I started to discover this other world of Korea\u0027s mountains. \u0027They contained a deep history of fairy tales, mythologies, animistic religions, culture, foods, arts, and literature, all stemmed on mountains. \u0027In this busy Korean world, they had this ancient influence from their mountains, which they were all understandably born of.\u0027 Mr Shepherd is planning to release a book about his work on the Baekdu Daegan containing photos of the amazing scenery, as well as the villages and its people.He recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the release, which will also include essays on the Baekdu Daegan.

I would like to see a two-country one-nation system slowly developed. The border reduced from fortified to crossable, and then some mixture and development via exchange.\u0027We could end up seeing a new political direction for Korea. An emergence of both a socialist and capitalist system. \u0027Koreans are talented people with a will to do it their way, given a chance. There are also willing and keen to adapt and take on all technologies and global ideas. They can set an example.          Mr Shepherd hopes that with both North and South Korea in negotiations over bringing peace to the peninsula that the Baekdu Daegan can became a symbol of unification.

Eyes on the wall are looking back. There’s tension there. I’m not sure if it’s hopeful or not’I’ve lived in Belfast almost all my life. When I took this, I had recently moved to the north of the city, to Limestone Road, in search of cheaper rent. I didn’t know until after I moved in, but it was at the border between a Catholic and a Protestant area. For the first time in my life, I witnessed sectarian violence right on my doorstep: regular riots, brick and bottle throwing.I took it just off Limestone Road, a few minutes from where I lived and still close to where I am now. As a photographer, you get a sort of sixth sense for places that might prove interesting and that’s what drew me here. The place was abandoned, ruined. I’ve no idea who put the chairs there, or whether they were the same people who sprayed the graffiti and smashed the wall. At first glance, the hole looks like it’s been broken through, but if you look closer you can see intact bricks jutting out, almost as if it was taken apart brick by brick.The chairs look out on to the green space, but then there’s a pair of eyes on the wall looking back. I’m interested in the tension between those views. I’m not sure if it’s hopeful or not. Then there’s the evidence of activity, perhaps by different people at different times who’ve long since disappeared. It’s an aftermath, but an aftermath of small, local events – not of a major battle or anything like that.It was taken some time ago, in 2002, but I’ve been making photographs of Belfast since the late 1980s. I’ve traversed it back and forth on foot. That’s the thing about living in a relatively small city for decades: you can observe small changes as they happen, while keeping a sense of the place as a whole. It all adds up to a portrait of Belfast through the decades.After the ceasefire, things started to change and I wanted to capture the new cityscape that was being put in place, which was at times reminiscent of a theatre set. One day, I saw giant trees being carted around the city on lorries. It was all part of the wave of redevelopment surrounding the peace process, with murals of new buildings against blue skies – in lieu of murals of gunmen. The developments were called things like Meridian Plaza or Horizon Building. It was a kind of anodyne future being plotted out for Belfast. But the reality of the city was always different.I’ve been back to this spot since. The building has been knocked down and replaced with an old people’s home. The residents probably have that same view out over Alexandra Park. It’s the only park in Belfast with a wall running through it — one of the so-called peace lines. There are miles of these walls criss-crossing the city. It’s still a very ided place. There’s a long way to go.I once showed this in a gallery in London and it was stolen. Somebody must’ve liked it enough to take it – and it was quite a posh gallery, too.Training: Documentary photography in Newport and Fine Art Photography in Glasgow.Influences: “Tom Paulin’s The Strange Museum and Rebecca Solnit’s Wanderlust.”High point: “Getting my series Bonfires printed by Steidl.”Low point: “Machine-printing holiday photos at Quik Snaps for seven years to get access to their dark room.”Top tip: “Keep your negatives in order.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7278a693c8091c44d4ebfe6ea2b6c47d03495cb5/0_251_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=909059cd86a243db8962afce150ca4ce","title":"may day celebrations in glastonbury in pictures","story":"Although more synonymous with International Workers’ Day and Labour Day, May Day, or Beltane, is celebrated by druids and pagans as the beginning of summer.

A breakdown of the nine metrics Ofcom looked at to determine how well a broadband provider performed showed that TalkTalk to be the worst performing in all of the factors, from willingness to help resolve a problem to courtesy and politeness of advisers.In the broadband customer service list, (ascending in quality), TalkTalk was followed by BT and its subsidiary EE in joint second Sky and Virgin Media were joint third, and the BT-owned Plusnet ranked best. TalkTalk also rated worst for customer service relating to issues from home owners who had their landline with the company.“In the case of TalkTalk, which scores poorly in terms of a range of customer service measures, there’s a feeling that the provider has struggled to redress its public image since the high-profile data breach of 2015,” said Ewan Taylor-Gibson, telecoms expert at the price comparison site uSwitch.The survey found that Ofcom received more complaints per 100,000 mobile users (48) against Vodafone than any about other provider.Overall, Virgin Mobile customers were least happy with the service they received, with less than half saying they were satisfied with the way their complaints were handled.“Broadband and mobile are now essential services for many of us,” Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said. “Consumers deserve services that meet the demands of modern life, yet these new figures show that not all providers are delivering. Citizens Advice research also reveals that loyal customers face higher prices in the telecoms market.” Among mobile companies, Tesco Mobile and Giffgaff, which is owned by O2’s parent company Telefónica, topped the table with customers most likely to recommend the providers to a friend.“People often focus on price when they’re choosing a phone or broadband provider,” said Lindsey Fussell, consumer group director at Ofcom. “But there are big differences in the customer service offered by providers. We are encouraging people to look beyond the price and consider customer service, too. In such a competitive market companies simply can’t afford to let their service standards slip. If they don’t up their game, customers can vote with their feet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa74d0828da201ada3d4d59191b91967e34151b/0_105_4342_2605/master/4342.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3b96f2b34419cc0c69e88b88c081366","title":"an open book a photographers love letter to city libraries in pictures","story":"Swiss librarian and photographer Thomas Guignard captures the beauty, symmetry and intricate designs of libraries across the worldTo some they are a sanctuary, to others a place of silent boredom, but to Swiss photographer Thomas Guignard libraries are a thing of beauty. Working as a librarian and photographer for the last 12 years, Canada-based Guignard combines his great loves in the Instagram account @concretelibraries. “Libraries are the tangible, physical and often monumental representation of human knowledge,” he says. “They are built to share and make that knowledge accessible, to foster community, to encourage the sharing of ideas and invite everyone to contribute to that trove of knowledge.”Guignard has photographed library buildings across the world, from his current hometown of Toronto to Oxford, UK via Detroit in the US. So far he’s visited 35 libraries and has a bucket list of about 310 that he hopes to visit and photograph in the future. Guignard’s interest in library architecture grew in parallel with his photography practice. Whilst working for the library at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, he was involved in the development of a new learning centre, which opened in 2010. As part of his research, Guignard visited other, photographing unique details of their design, and gradually became fascinated by them.“As I visited those libraries, I took more and more pictures, and became more interested in those spaces for their unique aesthetics,” he says.“I try to use symmetry and pay particular attention to how I align my shots to highlight the sacredness of these spaces.”Guignard sees libraries as symbols of “gathering places for communities”. “They are participatory they can’t exist without users, a community – and, of course, librarians and library workers, who do so much more than just stamp out books.” Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @cities.

Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George TownAsia is growing. Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George Town“Before, there were many fish,” says fisherman Mohd-Ishak Bin Abdul Rahman as he pulls a dried up crab from his net. A few years ago he could just walk out into the surf and pick up crustaceans with his bare hands, he tells me. “Now, nothing.”He blames the palisade of new luxury condominiums that rise on the coastline behind him. Built on 240-acres of land artificially reclaimed from the sea, they are part of the Seri Tanjung Pinang 1 (STP1) project. Started in 2006, it brought a taste of new Asian modernity to what was then a rural area beyond the fringes of George Town, Penang’s only city. It also took away the fish, says Mohd-Ishak.The 72-year-old is the undisputed chief of Tanjung Tokong, a fishing village of 100 houses built by the community a few decades ago. He is also the leader of a movement of fishermen protesting against development projects they claim are destroying the island’s fisheries, and with them their livelihoods.Mohd-Ishak says his family has been fishing the area for at least five generations. As we talk, shirtless fishermen watch cautiously from handmade hammocks, half-broken plastic chairs and pieces of junk that washed up on the shore.The contrast between the village with its shacks built from planks, beams and drift wood and the condos, swimming pools, luxury mall and Irish-themed pub is extreme.Now the second phase of the STP project is in full swing. Dredgers, barges, bulldozers and diggers operated by a local subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) are busy creating 1,000 more acres of land for luxury development. Slated for completion in 15 years, the STP2 development is expected to have an eventual value of $4.4bn.Land reclamation is nothing new in Asia – China, Hong Kong and Japan have been at it since the 19th century – but it has recently reached epidemic proportions. Maritime ecosystems are abruptly transformed as natural islands are artificially conjoined with coastlines, natural shorelines are extended and artificial islands are built from scratch.Cities on China’s coast reclaimed an average of 700 square kilometres of land – that’s about the size of Singapore – from the sea every year from 2006 to 2010 for new houses, industrial zones and ports. The 130 sq km of land that was reclaimed to build the new city of Nanhui was significant enough to reconfigure China’s national map, and the reclaimed land for the Caofeidian economic zone was twice the size of Los Angeles.Concerned these megaprojects were getting out of control and doing irreparable harm to the environment, Beijing stepped in earlier this year and put an end to land reclamation projects that were not spearheaded by central government.Meanwhile, many Asian cities are picking up where China left off. Besides the STP projects on Penang, Malaysia has massive reclamation works under way for the 700,000-person Forest City in Johor the Philippines is reclaiming 1,010 acres from the sea for its New Manila Bay – City of Pearl Cambodia is building a slew of Chinese-financed properties on reclaimed land Dubai has turned reclamation into an art form and Sri Lanka is building a new financial district on the dredged and deposited land of Colombo International Financial City. Around a quarter of modern-day Singapore was open sea when the nation state came into existence in 1955.Apart from acting as geopolitical flash points – reclamation in the South China Sea is repeatedly bringing the region to the brink of conflict – sourcing the sand is a major problem. Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam have already banned the export of sand, with reports of a multibillion dollar black market run by organised crime syndicates. Some of Indonesia’s Riau Islands have mysteriously disappeared – loaded on to barges and shipped to nearby Singapore, reports suggest. The verdant, hilly island of Penang has been gripped by a development boom since the historic centre of George Town was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2008. As tourists poured in from all over the world, so too did prospective property buyers looking to take advantage of the Malaysia My Second Home programme, and floods of east Asian real estate speculators.“Penang has this obsession with wanting to become like Hong Kong and Singapore,” explains Andrew Ng Yew Han, a local film-maker who has documented Penang’s development.The state government’s crosshairs soon fell upon the other natural feature hemming in their ambitions: the sea. Taking a trick from the playbooks of their model cities, Hong Kong and Singapore, Penang launched several large-scale reclamation initiatives – many strategically placed in prime locations.This ability to home in on high-value sections of cities to reclaim land for new development often produces incredible profits. Research from Ocean University of China professor Liu Hongbin found that land reclamation in China can produce a 10- to 100-fold profit.“If you are confident that you can sell the properties at a high price, which is likely the case at the fringe of large coastal cities or in popular coastal tourism destinations, reclaiming the land from scratch could potentially be more profitable than building on extremely expensive existing land,” explains Matthias Bauer, an urban designer who has worked on reclamation projects in China. However, there is a lot more at stake with these projects than the money that is invested in them. Not only are the fishermen of Tanjung Tokong banned from entering what was once an extremely productive fishing ground but there are now fewer fish in the waters near their village. Mohd-Ishak claims his catches have halved since development began.Walking with him down the beach, another fisherman calls me over to his small house. His name is Haron Din, and his torso and legs are covered in the traditional tattoos that many fishermen in south-east Asia once wore. At his feet lie piles of torn up old nets. He pulls out a dried up crab and explains it was dead long before it got tangled in his net. “The mud from the project suffocates them,” he says.Holding a shiny new white net next to one of the 40 or so damaged ones littering the beach, Din complains that mud from the nearby reclamation area is killing the local marine life and doing irreparable damage to their fishing equipment.The fishermen must travel further out to sea to find fish, which drastically increases both the cost of petrol and the dangers of the job. Unable to make a living in their sheltered bay, they now have to cross a busy shipping lane and contend with higher waves. There have already been a few deaths, Mohd-Ishak says.Mageswari Sangaralingam, a research officer for Friends of the Earth Malaysia, says the thousands of sq km of land reclaimed across coastal Asia has meant the annihilation of mangroves, wetlands and reefs – destroying the habitats and breeding grounds for fish, sea turtles, crustaceans, plants and other marine life. In addition, the new cities, transport hubs and industrial zones built on the new land inevitably create added pollution and waste, he says.“The multimillion-ringgit fisheries sector here on which thousands depend is being traded off for development,” says Sangaralingam. “Fish are being wiped out, and the fishermen will soon be too as they lose fishing grounds.”“You have this development and yet people are losing their jobs,” adds film-maker Han. “You have reclamation which promised development, but you have fishermen who are losing their livelihoods, looking for second jobs … You build so many buildings here but in the end it doesn’t belong to us, it will be bought up by other people and foreigners.”I visit Straits Quay – the high-end shopping mall surrounded by luxury condos overlooking the fishing village. On three trips here I’ve never seen anyone actually shopping in its luxury boutiques. The hallways are bare wind tunnels and even the giant atrium that acts as an opulent entranceway to the mall appears desolate, echoing the caws of resident crows and little else. If it wasn’t for a few stragglers slipping in and out to pick up groceries at the small supermarket – and the yacht owners drinking on the patio of the Irish-themed pub – the place could be called a ghost mall.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cacf94f206569df3e5b8ca506800806fb573ecd7/0_101_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a624dbc031573f0ae5b565dc3e2d8c","title":"home office new generation windrushers","story":"Young people born or raised in the UK are being ensnared by Kafkaesque bureaucracy – and paying an extortionate price for itThe new home secretary, Sajid Javid, has\u0026nbspwasted no time in disowning the\u0026nbspphrase “hostile environment”. But the real test he faces isn’t one of superficial terminology. First, there is the question of whether he will do anything to dismantle the day-to-day reality of prejudice that ensnared the Windrush generation with such appalling consequences whether he will concede that obliging landlords to check people’s papers under the threat of fines or imprisonment drags us backwards to a world where people with dark skin routinely face discrimination or that cutting off access to housing and work risks forcing people into exploitation on the black market.But there’s another dirty secret buried in the Home\u0026nbspOffice. The government’s futile, arbitrary target to\u0026nbspreduce net immigration to the tens of thousands means it is not just imposing further restrictions on who\u0026nbspcan come to the UK from abroad (no matter that the\u0026nbspNHS is desperate for doctors). It is making it harder for people here legally, including those who’ve grown up\u0026nbsphere, to become permanently settled.First, the eye-watering fees mean it costs more than £1,000 just to claim a child’s legal entitlement to citizenship if they were born in Britain to parents not settled here (they get this entitlement either when a parent becomes permanently settled or after they’ve lived here for 10 years). The Home Office makes a profit of £640 on each case. Some parents just don’t have the money, which means their British-born children may later be unable to work, go to university or use the NHS. Astonishingly, local authorities are obliged to fork out this fee for affected children in their care: a big financial disincentive to sorting this out before they turn 18. And if they don’t make citizenship applications for children – not born here, but who’ve spent most of their lives in care – they lose the right to apply altogether when they turn 18.For a young adult not born here but who has mostly grown up in Britain, the costs are even higher. They can apply for limited leave to remain for two and a half years after they turn 18, but it will cost more than £2,000 in fees and surcharges each time. They can only apply for indefinite leave to remain after 10 years, by which point they will have already paid at least £8,000. If they forget to renew their limited leave to remain (there are no TV licence-style reminders) or they can’t afford to do so, they have to start back from square one. If they want to go to university, they are treated as international students – charged thousands of pounds more in fees and blocked from student loans – until they’ve had three years of limited leave to remain, despite the fact their parents may have long been British taxpayers.The system is so fiendishly complex it takes a lawyer to navigate it. But there’s no longer any legal aid available, so these young people have to fund their own legal advice. There are plenty of sharks out there the charity Just for Kids Law has seen many cases in which shoddy advice means applications are rejected.In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to provide evidence that meets Home Office tests. There has been a dramatic shift in culture such that just a few years ago, if you could recall childhood memories of national events in an interview, that would have been accepted as proof that you had grown up in Britain. Today the bar is so high that people have to provide four pieces of documentary evidence for each year they have lived here. The sworn written statements from a doctor or a neighbour that would be accepted as evidence in a criminal court won’t do. The Home Office refuses to grant children in care citizenship unless they can produce documents such as their parents’ birth certificates – even when they are estranged from their birth parents.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Even if you can get all these documents together, there are two reasons why there’s no guarantee your application will be processed. First, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) tells me the Home Office is apt to lose people’s files, or claim it has never received documents. Second, every person over the age of nine applying for citizenship or leave to remain is subject to a “good character” test. JCWI has seen people fall foul of this test simply because they have had a previous immigration application rejected for minor errors.Worse, according to Solange Valdez-Symonds of the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens, there are cases where children in care have had their applications for citizenship rejected because they have been cautioned by the police – all too common for children who have had troubled childhoods.If you make even a small error in a complex form that s tens of pages, your application risks being rejected: JCWI cites rejections as a result of someone getting one figure wrong in one instance of a date filled in multiple times across the same form. While mistakes are rife in Home Office decision-making (half of all immigration appeals are now successful) the right to appeal has been scrapped in most cases. If you’re rejected, your only recourse is to apply – and pay up – again.Imagine trying to negotiate your way through all this as a young adult with limited financial resources, who grew up in Britain, who identifies as British – who to all intents and purposes is British. Everything about this system is designed to catch you out, to end in rejection. If you run out of cash or steam, you’ll end up as one of the “illegals” denied access to healthcare, education, housing and a job by Theresa May’s “hostile environment”. Just for Kids Law estimates that tens of thousands of young people could be affected.This is the sick reality that should be as big a scandal as the treatment of the Windrush generation. Even as it promises to right those terrible wrongs, the government is knowingly, consciously creating the next generation of Windrushers. And it doesn’t care.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ec9945bb17286509b2481c190204183acf2669/0_168_5130_3077/master/5130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7933e5e84e7825395a4e823d3c2192e","title":"no hard brexit not enough mps martin kettle","story":"With the wonderful benefit of hindsight, the great moments of political choice can take on a deceptive inevitability. Yet in real time, these moments that make or break governments – such as Sir\u0026nbspRobert Peel’s repeal of the corn laws, which split the Tories for a generation – are more typically the hard-fought climax of processes that\u0026nbspfollow a circuitous and up-and-down path, with the\u0026nbspkey decision put off until it is inescapable.The moment of decision for Theresa May over Brexit is following this pattern too. The route has meandered for nearly two years through negotiations, summits, law-making and elections this week’s English elections will be part of the context too. The climax has been long predicted and frequently postponed. To judge by what Downing Street said this week, as ministers prepared for Wednesday’s cabinet committee on customs arrangements with the EU, it may well be pushed back yet again by a few weeks. Yet the moment is nearing all the same.When it finally arrives it will be bitter and destructive,\u0026nbspabove all for the Conservative party. But the Brexit terms were always going to have to be faced in some form. That form, it now turns out, will focus on the customs arrangements.Much of the commentary presumes that the outcome remains in serious doubt. Yet it seems increasingly likely that the UK will seek to remain in some form of customs association with the EU. Whether the EU will agree is, however, another matter.May has already grappled with this question twice during the Brexit negotiations. Both times it has come up in the unavoidable context of the Irish border. Both\u0026nbsptimes, in December on the orce terms with the EU and in March when a transition agreement was made,\u0026nbspMay signed up to a soft border in Ireland. The argument in cabinet this week is likewise about May’s hope of another accommodation with the EU in the form of a “customs partnership”, or its more defiant alternative, the technologically driven “maximum facilitation” or “max-fac” option.It is certainly true that the terms of the earlier deals contained significant elements of fudge. It is also true that the UK side still talks about technological max-fac\u0026nbspsolutions that the EU dismisses as fantasy. Nevertheless, unless May now abandons those two earlier agreements\u0026nbspand unless the EU takes a much gentler line than it has done, there are only two realistic\u0026nbspoutcomes for Britain to choose from while avoiding the return of a hard border in Ireland.These outcomes are, first, the UK remaining in some form of continuing customs union with the EU or, second, Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union while Britain leaves it. The latter is opposed by Northern Ireland unionists and May dismissed it as recently as Wednesday when she said at prime minister’s questions that an Irish Sea customs border was something no UK prime minister would agree to.This leaves UK membership of the customs union – or something on similar lines – as still much the most likely outcome of the internal British political argument. Why? Because the EU has shown no interest in, and is under little internal pressure to explore,\u0026nbspeither of the alternative options\u0026nbspbeing debated by British ministers, and the arithmetic in parliament is tending that way too.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.In the House of Lords, Tory peers have voted with the opposition parties to demand a continuing customs union. Meanwhile, in the Commons pro-European Tory MPs have put their names to pro-customs union amendments to two government bills. These would carry forward last week’s backbench debate on the same subject, on which a resolution of support for continued customs union membership was adopted without opposition.None of this guarantees that parliament will take a similar line when the votes come up in a few weeks’ time. But none of the other options is any likelier. At present, the numbers are close but in favour of the amendments. All the opposition parties (bar a small number of Labour leavers) plus the 15 or 20 declared Tory rebels would normally be enough to either defeat the government outright or to force it to accept defeat in advance, as it did this week on tax haven controls.The very fact that last month the government seemed to be flirting with making these into votes of confidence makes clear that they think they will lose them. Yet behind that admission there is a deeper and more stubborn truth. There is not a majority in the Commons for a hard Brexit. And there is no alternative prime minister to May\u0026nbspwho can deliver one, either. Short of a general election or a collapse of the negotiations, the only outcome of this process is a soft Brexit of some kind. If we see May’s purpose as being to obtain the least isive\u0026nbspsoft Brexit for the Tory party, we are much closer\u0026nbspto understanding what is happening.Yet there will be isions. Some Tories will reject any soft Brexit, although no cabinet Brexiteer has said it is a resignation matter. But the issue need not bring May’s government down. Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Eurosceptic\u0026nbspsabre-rattling over the customs issue this week is a bluff she will have to call.In the end and with no small irony, the pivotal issue in Brexit is the same one that in different ways has so haunted British politics for more than two centuries – justice for Ireland. Today, peace and prosperity in Ireland depend upon a soft Brexit for which there is a parliamentary majority. A hard Brexit, with a hard Irish border​,​ is clueless, delinquent and playing with fire, as Chris Patten put it in the Lords on Wednesday. It was a similar choice for Robert\u0026nbspPeel. In February 1846, as the corn law repeal process neared its climax in the wake of the potato famine, Peel told his MPs: “It is absolutely necessary before you come to a final decision on this question that\u0026nbspyou should understand this Irish case. You must do\u0026nbspso.” Then, as now, it was the right advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e6c5d574e779d97f974a833aef53f31e50aa52/4_0_3534_2121/master/3534.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e22d01fe4d1403a4df63718c995dfe5","title":"the guardian view on tory divisions deeper than brexit","story":"A remarkable and alarming feature of the Brexit process\u0026nbspso far is the way deadlines that ought to force the\u0026nbspgovernment to make difficult choices come and go with critical decisions stubbornly untaken.A cabinet committee meeting on Wednesday was billed as a crunch point on the question of a customs union. But, as different Tory factions lobbied Theresa May with increasing urgency, the crunch was deferred.The broad choice is between invisible borders, but with compromise on the UK’s ability to determine aspects of external trade policy, and freedom to erge from EU rules, but at the cost of friction at the border.This is a choice Mrs May seems incapable of making, because the customs union has become the proxy for a deeper Tory schism. Two technical options have been on the table. One is a “customs partnership”, which involves a simulation of existing EU arrangements, but with rebates on offer for businesses wanting to enjoy UK-specific tariffs. A second idea, preferred by hard Brexiters, is “maximum facilitation” (max-fac, in the jargon), which concedes the return of border infrastructure, but imagines it being minimal, thanks to “trusted trader” schemes and hi-tech enforcement.These ideas are problematic in their own ways. The customs partnership would put in place a bureaucratic labyrinth. Max-fac relies on technology that no one has identified, let alone tested. And the restoration of border posts, even discreet digital ones, risks reneging on Mrs May’s promises of an invisible frontier in Northern Ireland. The EU side is sceptical of both models.Not for the first time, Mrs May appears to be organising Brexit around the fixations of a small clique of Tory MPs, without regard for what is available in Brussels. Simpler routes are possible: a majority in the Commons would support a customs union the Lords has already voted in support of one.The whole debate is suffused with dishonesty. Those who push for softer Brexit options are attached to the customs union because they see the whole exercise in terms of damage limitation. They know that the logic of keeping cross-border trade frictionless is also a case for staying in the single market, for which the best available terms are the ones Britain enjoys now, as an EU member state.On the other side, hard Brexiters are desperate to leave the customs union because regulatory alignment with the EU spoils their ambitions for a purgative transformation of the UK along ultra-Thatcherite lines – a frenzy of creative economic destruction, as they see it. But they do not make that agenda too explicit, because there is no great public appetite for it. Also, the prime minister insists that Brexit is not a threat to labour or environmental protections. Those who itch to light a bonfire of European regulation need Mrs May’s reassurances as cover under which they smuggle their matches.These are ideological battles being artificially channelled through minute technical differences of emphasis on one aspect of Brexit. They raise profound questions about the UK’s destiny and express incompatible notions of what it means to be a Conservative in the 21st century. But Mrs May lacks the reserves of political capital or intellectual energy to referee that argument, let alone shape it to her own will. So she postpones the difficult choices. This has proved to be an effective technique for deferring crises, but it is a fundamentally dishonest way to govern. And, while survival on these terms suits the prime minister, it is not clear who else’s interests are really being served."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2251bfce88bb4ec6efddb551fe981066d2c8edc8/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0335be3eb043e02dca4bd9444e61300f","title":"what to do in vancouver a 48 hour itinerary","story":"A multicultural seaport city with thriving arts and culinary scenes, set against the backdrop of a picturesque mountainscape and coast? It’s no shocker that Vancouver regularly tops lists of the world’s most liveable cities, but where to start if you’ve only got two days in town? MorningStart the day right at cult bakery Purebread in Gaston – an outpost of their popular Whistler address. Earl Grey and lavender scone, lemon chèvre brownies or white chocolate whoopie cookies with your morning coffee? Breakfast of champions. Suitably carbed up, join Talaysay Tours for a kayak trip (April-Sep) – paddling the Salish Sea with an indigenous guide who’ll share aboriginal history and culture with you as you explore the rainforest coast – or a Talking Trees hike (year-round) along the north shore. Learn about the Coast Salish legends of the trees while you discover the plants that were used for food, shelter, art and medicine.Stop for lunch at Tap and Barrel Shipyards for local craft beers and wine on tap, along with sustainable seafood, piled-high pizzas and rice bowls. Keep an eye out for “Mealshare” options on menus across Vancouver that provide a free meal for at-risk youths every time a Mealshare item is ordered.AfternoonYou may be surprised to find that just outside of town you’ll find a peak as tall as Wales’s Snowdon: Grouse Mountain. In summer, the Skyride Surf Adventure lets visitors ride the roof of the gondola as it climbs 1,610 metres to the summit. In winter, there’s a night-time snowshoe walk, illuminated by fairy lights. In every season, it offers spectacular views over the city. Vancouver recently legalised “happy hour”, which has been enthusiastically embraced with most restaurants running a 4-6pm deal and many offering a late-night one, too. Once you’ve scaled Grouse, head downtown for a cut-price drink and snack. Try Joe Fortes for C$5 (£2.80) happy hour beer and “buck-a-shuck” oysters Boulevard for octopus ceviche and C$6 high-balls or headcheese toast and a C$6 Aperol Spritz at Royal Dinette.NightGet the best of this fiercely foodie city through its pop-ups. Swallow Tail offers exciting culinary adventures in unusual locations, often with foraged foods. Elsewhere, Vancouver Foodster’s self-guided Tasting Plates nights are a fun way to eat around a neighbourhood, and the Greasy Spoon Diner series at Save On Meats sees big-name chefs creating upmarket takes on diner classics to raise funds for A Better Life Foundation.MorningBrunch is a big deal in Vancouver. Join the crowds at local favourite Jam for chicken and waffles or pancake-batter-dipped-and-fried sausages drenched in maple butter syrup. A few doors down is also brunch institution Chambar, where waffles – with bacon-caramel or the bon matin plate with eggs, tapenade, ham and cheese – are always just right. Next, head east to explore one of the city’s coolest neighbourhoods, centred around Main Street. Heading south from around E28th Ave, take in the colourful street art left over from the area’s annual mural festival (pictured above) then stop for a bit of shopping in Main Street’s erse indy boutiques. Browse rare vinyl at Red Cat Records, local art and graphic novels at Lucky’s Comics, handmade notebooks and badges at quirky stationery store Regional Assembly of Text and pick up a pretty floral dress or two at The Barefoot Contessa.Refuel at Dock Lunch, a 16-seat spot that looks more like your gran’s front room than a restaurant. Chef-owner Elizabeth Bryan serves up something different almost every day (apart from the non-negotiable Friday meatball banh mi) – check Instagram for the menu. If Dock Lunch is out of space, try the Cascade Room for unpretentious west coast food – the wild sockeye salmon burger is superb.AfternoonKeep cruising down Main for fine art South Main Gallery and contemporary local works and performance at Hot Art Wet City. If you’ve still got the energy, push on to Centre A in Chinatown to explore contemporary Asian art before rewarding yourself for all that culture with craft beer at relaxed Brassneck or locally distilled spirits at Juniper bar.NightFor dinner, check out the West End’s treasure trove of Asian restaurants – you’ll find a deeply satisfying, steaming bowl of ramen on every corner. Alternatively, go ultra-Canadian on your last night at the Timber gastropub, which serves comfort food favourites such as poutine and bison burgers, or try Forage for locally sourced, sustainable fare like Haida Gwaii halibut or foraged stinging nettle risotto.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fe847ac2e86c03516703ecb54b35500f7145817/0_9_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1691c8512901a069851466e9012c49e3","title":"my canadian food odyssey by chef john quilter","story":"On his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaOn his six-week journey from east to west Canada, chef John Quilter – AKA The Food Busker – finds a salt beef sandwich that’s 10 days in the making, a killer craft beer brewed with foraged herbs and the best Chinese meal outside of ChinaFor many years, Canada has rented a room in my thoughts, ever since I worked there as a young chef. I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country. When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed. The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.  Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”. The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.  Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours. Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto. One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13db697d6353b087fe4ad5d71b85ccf6c2ae77a6/0_343_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10e9e0fd9ddf93726ab15b04cf5750e9","title":"canada is one of the coolest countries on the planet if you want proof take a look at its festivals","story":"From the glamour of the Toronto International Film Festival to the freewheeling Halifax Pop Explosion, Canada’s erse, culturally dynamic population knows how to party. Get in on the action with our four favourite Canadian festivalsWhen Miguel Zamora Sanchez first arrived in Toronto after moving from his native Mexico, he was immediately struck by the city’s ersity. “The first weekend I was here it was the gay pride parade,” says the student. “And that same day I saw a jazz festival – it was spread out through the entire city.”It may all have been new to Sanchez at the time, but this will come as no surprise to anyone that’s spent much time in the country. Canadians have a long history of celebrating art and culture, resulting in a vibrant, varied, year-round festival calendar up there with the world’s best. Take the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), which began in 1976 and attracted more than 30,000 attendees in its inaugural year. It is now one of the film industry’s highest-profile events (considered by many in Hollywood to be second only to Cannes in terms of headline premiere screenings and star power) and one of the largest publicly attended film festivals in the world – with almost 400 movies being screened and as many as 480,000 people attending.Piers Handling, director and CEO of TIFF, believes the city’s erse, multicultural population is the spine of the festival’s success. Despite the many A-listers that flock to the city every autumn for the festival – bringing the eyes of the world with them – TIFF thrives because of the people that call Toronto their home all year.“What makes the festival cool is the public,” says Handling. “It’s a very warm, welcoming and erse public. They’re not judgemental. They’re very, very open. They’re not cynical. They’re incredibly curious. So many film-makers have said that it’s the best public to show their film to for the first time.”That openness and cultural savvy isn’t just limited to film, either. Five years ago, Field Trip, an annual summer music festival that hosts approximately 10,000 visitors a day at historic Fort York in downtown Toronto, was launched. While it can be difficult for a new festival to find its footing with so many other competing brands and approaches, Field Trip has thrived because it aims to welcome a broad demographic – not just younger tastemakers.“One of the strengths of the festival is that it’s very community focused,” says Field Trips’s co-director Aaron Miller. “It’s family focused.”Held over two days in June (2-3 June 2018), the festival has brought celebrated acts such as the National and Phoenix – as well as homegrown talents Broken Social Scene and Feist – to Fort York, but still strives to curate a programme that appeals to all ages. “It’s the ersity and the inclusiveness,” Miller says of what makes the festival “cool”. “Those are obviously buzzwords that are associated with Toronto. No place is perfect and this city, like many others, has a lot of work to do. But, ultimately, Toronto does do a pretty good job of celebrating ersity. That ethos is what Field Trip really grabs on to.”Hundreds of miles away from Toronto, the port city of Halifax is also enjoying a flourishing creative movement that hinges on its ersity. Once known as Seattle of the North for its thriving grunge scene in the early 90s, the Nova Scotian capital now prides itself on attracting a wide variety of creative types.“We’re a real hub for artists and left-wing thinkers and people that want to express themselves,” says James Boyle, executive director of Halifax Pop Explosion, a multi-day music festival and conference.Boyle describes Halifax as “a melting pot of different perspectives, ideas and communities” and lauds the rich history of the African Nova Scotian community, the strength of its indigenous community and high student population as the main sources of this distinct outlook. “It’s a hub for ideas and music to flourish,” he says. “That’s why we have so many different genres of music. The city has become that place where people can come and speak their mind and push their ideas forward.”And it’s the festival-goers who reap the rewards of this freewheeling, inclusive approach, with an ever-expanding lineup of interesting, critically acclaimed acts.But few festivals can lay claim to the kind of heavy-hitting programme that Festival d’été in Quebec City offers. One of Canada’s largest music festivals, hundreds of artists play at the 11-day festival each year. Celebrating its 50th anniversary last year, it’s played host to the Rolling Stones, Metallica, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga in the past four years alone. But despite the monumental acts that the festival attracts, Luci Tremblay, communications director at Festival d’été, echoes Handling’s belief that the home audience is the most integral part of the festival’s success.“The people of Quebec make Festival d’été cool because the people of Quebec are cool,” she says. “The festival belongs to them, they are defending it, they love it. Summer here is short. It’s not always warm. So the people of Quebec, as soon as it gets warm, they want to get out. So they add that spirit to the festival and that’s what makes it unique.”“The artists are discovering something,” Tremblay says of the many big names who have played the festival. “When they arrive, they discover how big the festival is and they see the huge stage we have on the Plains of Abraham, which can hold up to 100,000 people – I remember Billy Joel saying that he’d been doing this job for 50 years and he wondered why he’d never come here. It’s always a discovery like that.”For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/586f3c6bb44634429023b27628441b06cbaa1802/0_29_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88303d7fd5a9089313ac44c9511480de","title":"universities minister one set of guidelines free speech campus","story":"Sam Gyimah says rules now let ‘bureaucrats or wreckers on campus’ stop discussionThe UK’s complex tangle of regulations governing free speech on university campuses should be replaced by one clear set of guidelines for both students and institutions, according to the universities minister.In a speech at a closed-door seminar on free speech on campus, the minister, Sam Gyimah, will suggest the Department for Education oversees the creation of the first new set of guidelines – since the free speech duty was first introduced in 1986 – to “provide clarity”.The current web of rules allows “bureaucrats or wreckers on campus” to block discussion of unfashionable views, according to Gyimah. He blames the complexity for the rise in safe spaces and no-platform policies.“A society in which people feel they have a legitimate right to stop someone expressing their views on campus simply because they are unfashionable or unpopular is rather chilling,” the minister will say. “There is a risk that overzealous interpretation of a dizzying variety of rules is acting as a brake on legal free speech on campus.”Among the guests invited to the seminar are Matt Collins, the Home Office’s director of Prevent, a programme to tackle extremism and radicalisation, and Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission.Gyimah’s idea would bind both students and universities to a common code of practice on free speech, although there appears to be little enthusiasm for this among either university or student leaders.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, will also attend the seminar. He said a recent parliamentary inquiry had found no systemic problems with free speech at British universities.He said: “Universities are committed to promoting and protecting free speech within the law. Tens of thousands of speaking events are put on every year across the country, the majority pass without incident. “A small number of flash points do occasionally occur, on contentious or controversial issues, but universities do all they can to protect free speech so events continue.”Gordon Marsden, the shadow higher education minister, said Gyimah was trying to “micromanage free speech issues”, and that any discussions about regulation should be conducted in the open, rather than at private meetings inside the DfE.“This announcement is simply another piece of meaningless posturing from the government, while it has nothing practical to offer students dealing with record levels of debt,” he said. “If the minister was serious about the challenges students face he would abandon his unworkable plans to fine universities over the actions of independent student unions and follow Labour’s commitment to bring back maintenance grants and scrap tuition fees.”The DfE said participants in the seminar would discuss how the guidelines would be compiled, with the the department overseeing their creation.The Office for Students, the new higher education regulator, will also have a duty to protect free speech, with powers to publicly shame or fine institutions for not upholding principles of free speech."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e70765116b8f0847ead3970a60e7167b0d174a/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a0cb22f7d60ed079dd4316381944bb2","title":"recycle the weetabix what i learned from a month on the app that tackles food waste","story":"I am walking with a woman named Kerry, whom I have just met, to her car. She is in her mid-30s and has a tinge of attitude. When we reach her car, she opens the boot. Inside are hundreds of industrial-sized tubs of hummus, enough to power Brighton for a week.I met Kerry online, not via some kind of hummus-appreciation society messageboard, but on Olio, an app that is attempting to end food waste at home by letting people upload details of the food they would otherwise chuck out, so that others living nearby can take it off their hands. I am trying out the app for a few weeks to see if it can reduce my own waste to zero (and to see if I can get some freebies).For members willing to take things to the next level, like Kerry, they also have a “food waste heroes” programme, where volunteers offer to pick things up from cafes and shops and list this food on the site. After picking up these hummus tubs from a supplier that had no use for them, Kerry is now spending one of the hottest days of the year shepherding people to and from her car. She was disappointed when I said said I could only take four – “Are you sure your friends and family wouldn’t want some?”Most hot-button environmental issues have to go on a journey, from being pipe dreams discussed in the furthest reaches of the Glastonbury green fields to a central plank of government policy. Climate change, non-GM food, plastic pollution – they were all once dismissed as fringe politics, until the government and industry suddenly got on board. For food waste, it seems as though that moment is now. In the past six months, Tesco has reduced all edible food waste to zero, Co-op is trialling the sale of products that have passed their best before date and the EU has announced that, for the first time, it is forcing member states to report on how much food is wasted each year, with the goal to halve waste by 2030.Launched in 2015, Olio feels part of this sea-change in our attitude to waste. The app was started by Tessa Cook and Saasha Celestial-One (the latter’s names come from her Iowa-hippy parents – although she rebelled by becoming an investment banker). Cook was previously managing director at Wonga, the controversial payday loans firm. She grew up on a farm in North Yorkshire, and says she got the idea after being left with a few sweet potatoes and a cabbage on the day she was moving back to the UK from Switzerland. It was not feasible to take them with her, but knowing how much work had gone into growing fresh produce she couldn’t bring herself to chuck them out. Like so many tech-inventors of the modern era, she thought: there should be an app for that.I have to admit I was part of the problem. When I first moved out of home, I chucked out food even if it seemed fine, because I couldn’t remember how long ago I bought it. I would get lots of ingredients for a complicated recipe, use a teaspoon of each and then leave them in the fridge till they went off – not knowing what else to do with the remainder.When my partner, who works in food, first moved in, she was horrified. I was instructed that the kitchen had to change: uneaten bananas would be chopped up in the freezer for smoothies, leftover milk gets turned into labneh even the rind of the parmesan will be frozen to later be chucked into a minestrone. The kitchen became entirely refocused. The first question when cooking is not “what do you want to eat?” but “what have we got to use up”.Now I’m a fully paid-up member of the anti-food-waste brigade, Olio was an obvious thing to try out. After downloading the app, I immediately find plenty of listings, although a lot of them are more than 2km away, which seems quite a schlep to pick up a few carrots. There are a few single pastries, a half-eaten birthday cake and five leftover pieces of fried chicken. Mostly though, there’s just lots of white bread – packets and packets of half-eaten Kingsmill. I’m considering making a bread and butter pudding for the first time in my life but then I see the hummus stash pop up and my Olio journey begins.Inspired by my early score, I try to find some things to list myself, although our waste-not-want-not regime doesn’t leave much going spare. Eventually I find a packet of unwanted Weetabix, left behind by a previous flatmate. I put it on the site and await a response.One came within minutes – he said he could be over soon. The man who arrived told me that he had been using the app nearly everyday: he has a big family, none of whom are working much, and Olio can be a lifesaver. He says these days he doesn’t really leave the house unless it is to pick something up from Olio or go shopping. We talk about his struggles finding work, his depression, run-ins with the police and issues among his family. I realise it is probably the longest conversation I have had with a stranger from my area. After 80 minutes of chatting, he asked if I had any other food I could give him – I said I would have a look around and let him know. It’s an odd feeling: was I helping? Is it patronising? How could I ever let anyone else on the site pick something up from me now, when this man was in such need?Olio’s online spiel is similar to a lot of companies that believe technology can change the world. Its positioning feels aspirational, with neighbours working together.The initial trial for the app took place among 12 people in Crouch End the first item to be shared was half a bag of shallots. But what quickly becomes apparent is that many of the people on Olio are using it as an alternative or supplementary food bank.I put it to Cook that the app exists on two different levels: one for a well-meaning middle class, with food leftover from fashion shoots or Sunday dinner, and then people who are travelling a long way to pick up not very much food at all.“What has been quite shocking for us to discover on this journey, is how many hungry people there are in this country,” Cook says. “I’ll be very honest, I had no idea and I think many people have no idea. Since working on Olio, I have learnt that 8.4 million people are living in food insecurity. We have found that around a third of our regular requestors are living in poverty. What I’ve heard from a lot of those people is that what they love about the app is that there is no stigma when they collect food.”Isn’t there something a little uncomfortable, though, about those with too much giving their scraps to those with too little? “We don’t like to think of it as the haves giving to the have-nots. Actually this is just part of modern everyday communities, it’s absolute madness that people are throwing away perfectly delicious food on the one hand, while living nearby are people who would like that food or perhaps even need that food.”Over the next few weeks, I continue to use the app, mostly for non-food items. I give away a lampshade to one man called Ty and some toiletries to another called Ramneek – both twentysomething locals who say they have been on the app for a while, just doing their bit to reduce waste. I also pick up an old milk-bottle collector that I have repurposed into a shower caddy.But most of the time I look on Olio, the pickings are relatively slim. Desirable items go very quickly and most are far away. I also decide that it is not right to pick up ready-to-eat food such as sandwiches and pastries, which make up a lot of the listings, when there are people using the app in serious need.Olio claims to be the biggest food-sharing network in the world. More than 500,000 items have been shared in more than 40 countries. It is a pretty good start for an app that has only been going for a few years, but it feels like a drop in the ocean considering how much is wasted each day.It is a bold ambition and they are a long way off, especially considering that they are far from the only organisation aiming to tackle this problem. FareShare, Wrap, Freegle, Food Cycle and The Felix Project are just some of the groups trying to help ease the food waste problem. Still, Olio can provide food that some charities wouldn’t bother with – lots of listings on the site are for a couple of potatoes or half a sandwich.In recent weeks, plastics have been top of the agenda when it comes to new environmental policy, with the biggest food companies agreeing to end the use of non-recyclable packaging. This move should be taken as a sign of willingness to change – but food waste is arguably a more critical concern, because it is connected to so many modern afflictions: hunger, greenhouse gases, waste disposal and escalating food prices.And this is where there is an opportunity. It is not really the interface that matters: it can be a charity, an app or just a WhatsApp group between five people in a village, but if people are able to shake off the stigma about passing on the food they don’t want, they might help to fix a bunch of the world’s problems at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c33a3c25e7675390ceb049cf3a5954f390a4b512/0_258_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71b07b9ba943eef6b2207ad6333d4446","title":"climate change aid poor nations paris cop21 oxfam","story":"Finance for poor countries to help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and deal with climate change is lagging behind the promises of rich countries, an Oxfam report finds.While taxpayer-funded finance has increased, and the private sector has stepped up with some initiatives, the amount raised could still fall short of the goal of providing $100bn a year to the developing world by 2020.The 2015 Paris agreement on climate change re-stated the $100bn financial target, but Oxfam says the taxpayer-funded finance from rich countries in 2015-16 stood at about $48bn, or nearly half the amount promised for 2020. In a 28-page report published Thursday, entitled Climate Finance Shadow Report 2018: Assessing Progress Towards the $100bn Commitment, Oxfam says funding announced by donor countries involves projects and aid not directly related to climate change.The aid organisation found that only $16-$21bn of the overseas aid commitments fell under the strict definition of climate finance – if what was counted was just assistance directed towards reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and towards adaptations for climate change effects rather than economic and social development more generally. Tracy Carty, senior climate-change policy adviser at Oxfam, said the money flowing to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable to tackle climate change was “sadly inadequate”. At the Commonwealth summit held in London in April, governments from the Caribbean and Pacific islands – which make up close to half of the Commonwealth’s members – made impassioned pleas for assistance in dealing with storms, floods, droughts, sea level rises and other effects of climate change.Governments from around the world are meeting in Bonn this week and next under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to discuss how to implement the 2015 Paris agreement in practice. Climate finance is a key, though contentious, subject under discussion. Rich countries say that when contributions from the private sector are taken into account the amounts of climate finance are in line with the Paris commitments. But Oxfam said there was “no common methodology” to account for the contributions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9292906588b4c57703367793ead34ecf4c98b2fe/0_0_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b70377fd507d0b22d52d318e55b771c","title":"loyalty to navy shirts means monagamous relationshps","story":"Fidelity is not the only benefit of being with a man who is loyal to navy T-shirts. According to our fashion fixer, he can use the time saved to bring you tea in bedMy partner only wears navy T-shirts and jeans on weekdays. Is his fashion monogamy a good sign for us, or is he going to have a midlife crisis and buy a pair of cerise jorts? Helen, LondonI’ll be honest, Helen, I hadn’t previously considered the correlation between fashion and fidelity, but I do think you have a point here. After all, in my experience, contrary to all those women’s magazineDaily Mail headlines of the “What every woman should know to keep their man!!!” variety, most males are deeply monogamous in nature. Buckle up, everyone, while we enter the galaxy of … Sweeping Gender Generalisations!From my vantage point, at the coalface of gender observations, the majority of men, once they’re in a relationship for the long haul, just want to bed in. By which I mean they don’t want to have to make the kinds of efforts they once made when they were single. They get a bit fat, they go a bit bald, and that’s just fine with them because they’ve had enough of the hassle that they think goes into impressing prospective paramours. They’ve got their partner so can they just get some takeaway, watch Netflix and let their bellies flop over their jeans with secret elasticated waist, please? This explains why, over the age of 35, men tend to settle into a daily uniform, whether that’s a suit or (bad) jeans, (worse) khakis and neutral – meaning blue, white or tartan – shirts (men, for some reason, consider tartan to be a neutral on a button-down shirt, similar to the way women think of leopard print as a neutral when it’s on anything).This also explains why often the most untrustworthy men are the ones with the most inconsistent dress sense. I mean, look at Gavin Rossdale: one day a sexually ambiguous goth, the next a grunge rocker, the next a trendy Silverlake dad. Anyone could see which way this was going and, allegedly, it was going straight to shagging the nanny. Or Ben Affleck, who for years couldn’t figure out if he was a hunky leading man or an edgy indie director, and his oscillating clothing choices reflected that. He is now nicely settled into a T-shirt-wearing, fortysomething-dad groove but, alas, it allegedly took dating the nanny to find it. True, Donald Trump has been wearing suits since he was three years old and has probably grabbed the pussy of every pussy-possessing person who crossed his path. But then, there’s a consistency to that, as much as there is in his wardrobe.So what I’m saying, Helen, is I see nothing but promise in a partner who settles into a work uniform pretty much two minutes after getting married. He has found his thing and he’s sticking with it and I’m afraid that by “thing”, in this instance, I mean both the navy T-shirts and you. But, as we’ve already discussed, blue T-shirts are pretty much man’s greatest invention in many men’s eyes, so take it as a compliment.I think there are a lot of advantages to being with a man who wears the same thing every day, beyond the reassurance of fidelity. The primary one is with the time he saves in the morning by not having to decide what to wear, he can bring you tea in bed. But I would suggest he reassure his colleagues he’s not wearing the actual same clothes every day. Perhaps you could get some cards printed up for him to hand round the office.As for your fear of cerise jorts, I understand the concern, but I think it is misplaced. For a start, I strongly suspect a man who wears navy every day doesn’t even know what cerise is, let alone jorts, so this would be like worrying about him running off with Dua Lipa. He would need to Google just to get started here, so let’s not waste time worrying about the non-existent.At most, he might dally with what I call “man ‘fashion’”. These are fashion twists that conservative men allow themselves to indulge in because they think they are fun and they convince themselves they don’t threaten their masculinity. Absurd shoes are very much man fashion, as are watches, oddly patterned button-down shirts and waistcoats. Do not worry: this is just the sartorial equivalent of your partner getting a harmless little hobby, like fly fishing, or Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons. At heart, he’s still your navy T-shirted guy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a68d9585258e354748c3d1bbac9f826f14f787bd/0_6_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5187808844c9bf9d9856ebf456e1057","title":"cate blanchett claims harvey weinstein was inappropriate with her","story":"Australian actor speaks publicly for the first time about Weinstein’s alleged conduct towards her, saying that she ‘got a bad feeling from him’Cate Blanchett has become the latest Hollywood figure to claim sexual misconduct at the hands of studio mogul Harvey Weinstein. The Australian actor, who has appeared in Weinstein-produced films including The Aviator, Carol and The Shipping News, made the allegation during an interview with Variety. Asked if the producer sexually harassed or behaved inappropriately towards her, Blanchett replied “With me, yes.”“I got a bad feeling from him,” Blanchett added. “He would often say to me, ‘We’re not friends.’” When asked why Weinstein didn’t consider her a friend, Blanchett replied, “I wouldn’t do what he was asking me to do.” It is the first time Blanchett, a vocal supporter of the Time’s Up movement, has spoken openly about Weinstein’s alleged behaviour towards her.“When legal precedent is set by people being actually convicted, then other people can benefit from that because those precedents have been set.”Asked if Weinstein could go to jail if convicted of the allegations against him, Blanchett responded: “I hope so.” Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault and harassment by more than 70 women, and is currently the subject of criminal investigations in the US and the UK as well as a number of civil suits. A spokesperson for the producer says that he denies all claims of non-consensual sex made against him.The Australian actor also addressed the continuing controversy about director Woody Allen, suggesting that the allegations of sexual abuse made against Allen by his daughter Dylan Farrow should be tried in a court of law.Blanchett, who starred in Allen’s 2013 comedy-drama Blue Jasmine, has been criticised for remaining silent over the claims, which Allen denies. Farrow address Blanchett by name in an open letter published in the New York Times.“Obviously, Dylan Farrow has been living in a world of pain, and if the case has not been properly tried, then it needs to be reopened and go back into court, because that’s a place where those things get solved,” Blanchett said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c68bf19b2655129909f45f26520f66d9cc5ec18/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b65dab1d4e07085e18562a394483ab72","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp champions league roma real madrid","story":"A beaming Jürgen Klopp told his Liverpool side they must go and finish the job in Kiev by winning the Champions League after surviving their Roma scare. Liverpool were beaten 4-2 at Stadio Olimpico, their first defeat in Rome, but advanced 7-6 on aggregate to the final where they will face Real Madrid.And the Liverpool manager warned the holders that his team will be “on fire” in Ukraine having weathered another Roma recovery in the second leg of the semi-final. Klopp, who re-emerged from the tunnel to celebrate with the 5,000 delirious away fans half an hour after the final whistle, admitted his team had suffered and under-performed in the Italian capital. Not that he cared. Having guided Liverpool from the Champions League qualifiers to their eighth European Cup final appearance Klopp insisted his only focus was on ending a run of near-misses in finals and Real’s hold on the trophy on 26 May.“We were in a League Cup final and didn’t win it,” the Liverpool manager said. “People don’t tell me in the street since then: ‘Thank you for bringing us to the final.’ We were in the Europa League final too. Nobody tells me thank you. I see no trophies after these games. They don’t hang silver medals at Melwood. That’s a pity, but that’s the game. There’s still a job to do.Klopp joined his players in prolonged celebrations with the Liverpool supporters at the Stadio Olimpico. He later came back out to continue the revelry alone. He explained: “Seeing all these happy faces is the best thing that football can do. These people followed us all over Europe, come to Anfield, create an exceptional atmosphere, and we all know how big the desire is to come back on the winning track. They had such a big part in the season so far so if they want to see me, they can see me, no problem.”The Liverpool manager said his team were made to suffer by Roma because they did not capitalise on several counterattacks. “A big compliment for Roma,” added Klopp. “What a performance, what a comeback, what a great football game. In the high-intense moments we had brilliant counterattacks but not enough to finish them. There was a few penalty situations but I didn’t see them back so far. It was first time we were not as good as we can be.“We needed luck, that’s what we had, and over the whole campaign it’s deserved. It would have been deserved for Roma too. For both teams it would have been crazy to play extra time. So it was 7-6 on aggregate, which sounds crazy because it is crazy.“We came as a qualifier and are now in a final. I’m really happy for the boys, the club, the fans. It’s been a fantastic ride so far now we go to Kiev, which sounds crazy but it’s the truth. We will go to Kiev.”The Roma president, James Pallotta, was livid with the Slovenian referee Damir Skomina, insisting his refusal to award a penalty for handball by Trent Alexander-Arnold or dismiss Loris Karius for a foul on Edin Dzeko made the introduction of VAR an imperative in the Champions League.“I know it is difficult to ref but it is really embarrassing that we lose on aggregate like that. By the way, it should have been a red card which would have been 10 men in the 63rd minute. Liverpool are a great team, congratulations going forward, but if they don’t get VAR in the Champions League, stuff like this is an absolute joke,” Pallotta said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f9689c15f4abc8f9cba1f16bf974906e19ed9c/570_312_2814_1689/master/2814.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71c3280b22372fb9b49445a4c36111d0","title":"roma liverpool champions league semi final second leg match report","story":"Is it too presumptuous, when Liverpool have conjured up so many thrilling occasions en route to the Champions League final, to believe they might just have the attacking riches to prevent Real Madrid, the most successful team in the history of the European Cup, from registering a 13th triumph? The final will be on 26 May in Kiev and Liverpool, on this evidence, will be heading to Ukraine to score goals, live dangerously and examine the theory that Madrid can be susceptible at the back.Evidently, Jürgen Klopp’s team will need to tighten up their own defence, eliminate the mistakes that briefly threatened a late meltdown and cling to the hope their goalkeeper, Loris Karius, avoids one of his more accident-prone performances. Attacking-wise, though, it is certainly within their reach to ensure another year, 2018, is added to all those banners on the Kop – many of them visible here in Rome – acclaiming their previous wins in 1977, 78, 81, 84 and 2005. Klopp’s team have now accumulated 46 goals, qualifiers included, in this competition and Sadio Mané, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino have 31 of them. True, they will need to find a way to subdue Cristiano Ronaldo et al but if there is one certainty about this Liverpool side it is that they will attack with vigour and confidence.That approach was too much ultimately for Roma and, though it was a night of high drama, it was only in the final exchanges that Radja Nainggolan’s two goals meant Liverpool’s aggregate lead was down to one. Even then Roma did not actually manage another touch after Nainggolan’s stoppage-time penalty had made it 4-2. The game kicked off again, the final whistle sounded straight away and Klopp was charging on to the pitch to bearhug his players, one by one, starting with James Milner.There were wonderful scenes as the players celebrated in front of the corner where Liverpool’s supporters were going through their victory songs. There was even a team photograph which featured a touching tribute to Sean Cox, the Liverpool supporter so badly hurt last week. Despite the defeat, it felt like we were witnessing a group of players who had come of age. Barcelona, lest it be forgotten, had buckled under the pressure here, blowing a 4-1 first-leg lead in the quarter-finals. The score might suggest Liverpool almost did the same and, granted, it was closer than Klopp must have imagined after the first‑half goals from Mané and Georginio Wijnaldum. In truth, it was never really in doubt that it would be Liverpool in the final. That does not mean Klopp can be entirely happy with their performance bearing in mind the three second-half goals they conceded, the eccentric goalkeeping from Karius for Roma’s third goal and the two occasions in the same period when Serie A’s third-placed team should have been awarded a penalty. Roma gave everything and had a raucous crowd willing them on.Anfield was special for the first leg. Stadio Olimpico, a seething, whistling pit of bias, somehow managed to make even more of a racket. Of all the places Liverpool have been in this competition, all the stories they have accumulated over the years, have they ever experienced such a febrile din?That, however, was probably the most impressive part of Liverpool’s performance: their fearlessness. Roma’s record of having not conceded a single home goal in this competition – some achievement when their opponents have included Barcelona, Chelsea and Atlético Madrid – was gone within eight minutes. Liverpool began the game like a team in a hurry, not showing a flicker of apprehension, and had strong penalty claims of their own because of two Kostas Manolas challenges either side of Mané’s goal.Even when Milner’s freakish own goal offered Roma new hope, there was not a single part of the first half when Liverpool started playing with more restraint. Another side might have tried to draw the sting out of the game. Liverpool refused to sit back and it was typical that the corner for their second goal originated from a surging run by their outstanding left‑back, Andy Robertson. Roma could not clear Milner’s corner and when Edin Dzeko inadvertently headed the ball the wrong way, under pressure from Virgil van Dijk, it was too good an opportunity for Wijnaldum to pass up.Roma kept attacking, desperately trying to change the complexion of the evening, but they were in need of a football miracle and Liverpool had shown with the opening goal how devastating they could be on the break. Roma were vulnerable as soon as Nainggolan played the ball straight to Firmino. Mané was running to the Brazilian’s left, Salah was going the other way, and there were only three defenders back. Mané took a touch to control Firmino’s pass and fired emphatically past Alisson, Roma’s goalkeeper.Perhaps the second half would have been more hazardous for Liverpool if Stephan El Shaarawy’s 35th-minute shot had crept in rather than coming back off the post. Again Milner was involved, with the shot taking a hefty deflection off the midfielder. This time, however, Milner’s luck was in – in stark contrast to the freakish set of events, a quarter of an hour in, when Dejan Lovren tried to hack away El Shaarawy’s knockdown only for the ball to thud against Milner’s head and zigzag into the net.Roma began the second half knowing they needed four goals, with none in reply, just to take the game to extra-time. At least they had a go. Dzeko had a splendid game, barring the mistake for Wijnaldum’s goal, and made it 2-2 when Karius turned a shot into his path. Dzeko, wrongly flagged offside, should also have been awarded a penalty two minutes earlier when he went down under Karius’s challenge and Liverpool got away with another one when Trent Alexander-Arnold used his hand to block El Shaarawy’s shot.Karius was badly caught out for Nainggolan’s first goal and the penalty was for an alleged handball by the substitute Ragnar Klavan. The damage was superficial and, half an hour after the final whistle, Klopp came out again, pumping his fists and screaming with joy in front of 5,000 euphoric fans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55e3ba1597c7e50cd5afd4992f40649d3108abc0/0_141_6640_3985/master/6640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e2368cc15bdf99205d4a939b2ed17a4","title":"frank lampard interview we forget basics respect","story":"The former Chelsea midfielder reveals the principles that guide him and says he is ready to make the move into football management a year since hanging up his bootsIt is easy to imagine that the end of a footballer’s career comes as a massive, debilitating shock, suddenly depriving the player not just of their livelihood but also of routine, friendship, fitness and excitement. A little over a year since that moment came for Frank Lampard, he looks at it a little differently. There have been times, he says, when the sudden change in his life has “smacked me in the face”, but more commonly he has appreciated the release of the pressure accumulated over 21 years at the top of the game. As he plots his return to the sport as a manager, however, he is aware that it is only likely to be temporary.“I didn’t make all the right decisions in my career, far from it, but when I got to the end I felt I’d given it my full whack,” he says. “When you can think: ‘I put everything on the table and that’s my lot,’ I think you have been quite successful. That’s probably what drove me on as a player for quite a long while – I wanted to make sure I took every ounce out of the game and got the most out of myself.“And then it becomes like a relief, when you feel that the work’s done and it wasn’t too bad. I didn’t have too many failures, and I actually did some pretty good stuff. I’m very content with that. I’ve hardly kicked a ball since I finished, and I’ve got no craving to kick a ball. I do other things now.”Lampard won four FA Cups, three league titles, two League Cups and the Champions League and Europa League once each, as well as winning 106 England caps in an international career that stretched for only a few months short of 15 years. “When you’re at a big club, there isn’t much breathing space,” he says. “You’re continuously trying to win things, to perform to the best of your ability, and it can be quite tiring. I’ll be honest, at the end of my career I was ready to move on. In terms of the intense pressure I put on myself for that period of time, I felt ready. I’m asked a lot now: ‘Are you missing football?’ And I’m actually not. I sit here pretty happy with my lot.“When you’re playing you get looked after, you have people around you who completely put you out of the real world, and then the real world hits you smack in the face when you finish. But I was fortunate in that the transition hasn’t been a problem for me. I needed the pause, I really did. I needed the lack of structure in my life for a while. I felt kind of ready for that. It was a necessity for me to get away. It’s been a year and a half, almost, and now I have the hunger. So it’ll come when it comes, if the right opportunity comes for me.”Lampard has remained involved with football, swapping the pitch for punditry while he works on his coaching qualifications – he starts the Pro Licence course in September – and puts what he is learning into practice at Chelsea’s academy. “I’ve picked up a lot in this year, working in the media, travelling around” he says. “You have to do it properly. I don’t just roll up and go: ‘That was a good game.’ You have to look at the players, the tactics.“That’s why I’m not setting a time limit on the move into management. You don’t just flick a switch – you need to learn a lot again. There are no shortcuts as I see it.”Looking back at his playing career, Lampard says that “my biggest talent – or certainly one of them – was my work ethic and dedication”. He spent most of those years primarily focused on himself, on the constant betterment of Frank Lampard. He is conscious, however, that such a mindset cannot survive in management.His favourite coaches as a player, and the ones he wants to emulate, were those best at relating to the different characters in their team, and identifying for each one the approach that brought the greatest reward. “As a player you can be pretty selfish,” he says. “As a manager it’s the complete opposite of that. I’m really interested in the idea of trying to man-manage a group as well as I possibly could, to deal with a real mixed, erse dressing room like we have these days. There’s not one rule for everyone. I read a lot now because I love to find out about how other managers have tackled these things. That’s where the magic is.”Since retirement Lampard has filled what gaps have appeared in his life with travel, leisure and family. There have been no suddenly discovered hobbies or interests, no trips to the golf course. He lives his life according to the principles that drove him throughout his playing career. He has spoken before about his faith, and how it helped him through the death of his mother, a decade ago last week. He describes himself as a “not completely practising” Christian, but his beliefs inform everything he does.“I go about my life in terms of, I try to do everything right. And when I say right, I mean with the right intentions,” he says. “So when I work, I work as hard as I can when I have people around me I try to respect those people. Of course you make mistakes. But as I go through life if I feel like I’m doing it right – and this is what I try to tell my daughters now – then hopefully things will come good for me.“What you put in is what you get out. I think that in modern society – and I’m not preaching here, far from it – we do forget the basics, in terms of manners and respect for the people around you. I got brought up with those things, particularly from my mum, so I try to replicate them as much as I can, and pass them on to my daughters. I certainly don’t feel that I approach life now the way I did when I was 20. You learn a million things along the road, and I’m learning more now. But I do treat people as I want to be treated myself, and I try to take that around with me.”Perhaps that is why, for all the time he spent identifying his weaknesses as a footballer and laboriously improving them, for all the caps, trophies and goals, when that time came to an end what he wanted people to remember was something entirely different. “What I would have loved at the end of my career,” he says, “was for someone to just say: ‘He was a good team-mate.’ Not just on the pitch but also as a friend, as a buffer, as a person.”• The ‘Game Changing fans - The 12th Player in every Premier League team’ report can be downloaded here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd45b2c2cd8de1217567a55588cafd48d52d4f6/1149_427_4611_2766/master/4611.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e41fead7bde1dfa9d707493e07418f","title":"liverpool twist roma kiev champions league final real madrid","story":"It was, of course, never in doubt. Or perhaps only a little in doubt in those moments when Roma pressed and suddenly Liverpool’s defence began to look alarmingly zany, pockets of space opening up as though subject to a sudden buckling of the earth’s crust.Certainly the Champions League has never known anything like this. A 4-2 victory for Roma brought to an end a double-header that has seen 20 goals scored in two semi-finals, capped by a pair of hysterically open second legs. Defending is over. Clean sheets are over. Pour it on, let it burn. Elite club football has never looked quite so drunk on space, intoxicated by the urge to play only in forward gear.Not that any of this will take the gloss from a wonderful moment of triumph both for Liverpool and indeed for the Premier League, which has missed this stage. At the end of a sweaty, boisterous, agreeably open night in Rome that long march to the final continues. From Hoffenheim in August, through Spain, Russia, Slovenia, Portugal, Manchester and Italy. And followed now by the trek east to Kiev and the Soviet-scale stage of another, even more oppressively huge, Olympic Stadium.Before kick-off Rome was its usual beautiful, muggy, flaneurial self, despite the large police presence on the streets. On the bridges across the Tiber, Roma fans lounged carelessly, with the Stadio Olimpico a surprisingly green and fragrant kind of place, even on a day of high alert.Jürgen Klopp was faced with a teaser. To stick or twist: to hang on to the 5-2 riches of the first leg or to seek a little more, knowing that under pressure Liverpool’s defensive line is likely to offer up those same spaces “as big as the Mersey” he would talk about at his press conference two hours later.This is the question Liverpool now face, a quandary that will hang over their prep for Kiev in three weeks’ time. Real Madrid press with a murderous intent through those channels where Liverpool are weak, ganging up in the full-back areas, punishing every moment of hesitation. Klopp’s team have just conceded six goals to a moderate Roma. They are going to need a bigger boat.In particular Klopp will puzzle over the full-back positions. Trent Alexander-Arnold had a difficult game in Rome, something that will have been noted by those ruthless white-shirted opponents to come. Madrid score a huge number of goals from crosses. Quite what Kiev might bring if the right flank is left this open once again is a hair-raising question given the ruthlessness of Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo on that side.“Incubo Rosso” was the headline in the Corriere dello Sport, a reference to Roma’s evisceration in the first leg, but also an imprecation to their own team to create something similar inside this beautiful, open, flying saucer of a stadium.And in those opening moments Roma did press hard, looking to play diagonal balls in behind Alexander-Arnold, who scurried and hustled and just about hung in there. He was lucky not to give away a penalty for handball later. His passing went awry. It was a little painful at times. But Klopp kept him out there until the dying moments and after the final whistle it was Alexander -Arnold, the local kid, so full of life when he presses forward, who led the Liverpool huddle across the advertising boards and into a delirious moment of communion with the travelling fans.There is more, at times, to being part of a team. But this is rarefied air and Klopp will have a few weeks now to ponder how to close those spaces, to minimise the damage that will inevitably come.On the other flank Andy Robertson was his usual fine, physically relentless self. The moment that effectively killed the tie after 25 minutes was largely his work. With the score 1-1 Robertson sprinted out wide to keep the ball in by the touchline and then drove on, skating in thrilling fashion outside Alessandro Florenzi, a wonderful moment of adventure and brio. From the ensuing corner Georginio Wijnaldum headed in.Earlier Sadio Mané, man of the match on the night, had given the visitors the lead from another of those familiar breaks, three or four Liverpool players sprinting together, chest to chest, like an early heat in the men’s 60-metres dash. This time they were helped by Radja Nainggolan giving the ball straight to Roberto Firmino 40 yards from goal. Don’t do that. Don’t give the ball to Roberto Firmino 40 yards from goal. We know how this ends by now.After which Liverpool hung on, with enough in the tank to still take a tie they lost 6-2 over the final 110 minutes. But then for this team there is only one way: that of power chords and face-melting solos.Liverpool could choose to blink now, to seek that middle ground of damage-limitation. Or they could simply lock the wheel and go careering out over the edge of the cliff, silk scarves fluttering. In the year of breathless attack it would be a fitting moment to keep on driving, eyes fixed in front, towards a final that promises more space, more spills, and a shared surge to the line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089bc97a21f9432671672573542aa889fe9aebef/93_427_4953_2972/master/4953.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81d272fdef9b621f9f34e838f239b330","title":"roma v liverpool champions league semi final second leg live","story":"Liverpool are through to the Champions League final against Real Madrid after surviving a tense second-leg in RomeThere can be no doubt that Liverpool deserve to be in the final. They’ve scored so many goals, they’ve seen off Manchester City and they’ve outdone the team that put out Barcelona. Mind you, Roma will argue they should have had two penalties in the second half tonight and it will concern Jurgen Klopp that Liverpool ended up conceding four goals against a team they outplayed for much of the tie. That will be a big worry before they face Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo, who will surely have taken note of some of the defending here. But Madrid will have concerns of their own, chiefly that red swarm of an attack, with Sadio Mane flying, Roberto Firmino scheming and Mohamed Salah inspiring. If nothing else it should be a fabulous, free-scoring final. But that’s all from me tonight. I’ll leave you with Daniel Taylor’s on-the-whistle match report. Enjoy!“Boring” James Milner is asked if he’ll have a glass of red wine tonight. “Maybe for a few of the boys. You know me, maybe I’ll stretch myself to a glass of ribena or something.”James Milner speaks! “I don’t know what to say. We know how to make it interesting, don’t we? Brilliant football first half. Second half they put pressure on us, they’re a fantastic team. We need to do better. The penalty was a bit harsh and the first goal was a bit ridiculous. You can do that 1000 times and it’s not going to happen again. But to get to a Champions League final, nobody said that was easy and we’ve beaten some good teams. It was all about getting the job done and we’ve done that, no matter how difficult we made it.”Steven Gerrard speaks! “I don’t really remember much about the final I lost but I do remember Istanbul changed my life. When you deliver the Champions League trophy for your club it’s a life-changing experience and these lads can do it.”Andy Robertson says a few more words. “You look back at what I was doing last season, fighting for our lives at Hull. Unfortunately we fell short. We’ll enjoy Kiev. It’s all leading up to that game. We’ll go in as underdogs but sometimes that can be a good thing.”“Oh Andy, Andy! Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy Robertson!” chant the Liverpool fans. Admit it, you never thought Andy Robertson would be in a Champions League final. But here he is. “What a thing to be involved in,” the left-back says. “The lads and our fans deserve it. We’ll have a great day in Kiev regardless of the result. It’s hard when you come and defend a lead. You need to remember you’re defending that lead to make that final.”“Madrid in the final, it won’t be easy, a fantastic team,” Jordan Henderson says. “But we’ll go there with confidence and give it everything.” Gini Wijnaldum, who scored his first away goal for Liverpool, explains that he was standing unmarked and headed the ball past the goalkeeper. More when we have it.Jordan Henderson speaks! “We never do it the easy way unfortunately. Amazing effort. We knew it would be tough. We did well, scored some good goals. Overall I thought we handled the situation well apart from maybe the last 10 minutes of the second half, conceding two goals. We need to stop that.”Appreciative applause greets the final whistle, the Roma fans recognising the effort from their side. It was too little, too late from Roma, who have paid for shocking defending across both legs in the end. Down 5-2 after being battered at Anfield, they made it too difficult for themselves and Liverpool, despite losing on the night, are through to the final. It’s not like the visiting fans care about their team’s dodgy defending. They’re in their first Champions League final since 2007! The Liverpool players are celebrating in front of their fans. Jurgen Klopp is on the pitch, beaming as he embraces the injured Adam Lallana.

But would he have achieved all this if he’d been called Usain Jones? A paper published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2002, snappily titled ‘Why Susie Sells Seashells by the Seashore: Implicit Egotism and Major Life Decisions’ concluded that people were in fact disproportionately likely to ‘choose careers whose labels resemble their names’. So athletics gain was meteorology’s loss.

Stepanova was – naturally – a hurdler. She held the 400m world record holder and won the 1986 European Championship gold in the event. It’s likely she would have done the same at the 80 and 84 Olympic games, but the 400m hurdles was not an event for women in the former, and in the latter the Soviet boycott scuppered her changes.However, in news that will in no way surprise followers of athletics, it turns out that it wasn’t even her own name.

She ran in the Commonwealth games marathon for England in 2010, won the Edinburgh and Pisa marathons in 2014, and these days is as likely to be found running (and winning) ultras and trail races as road ones.

In Highgate village, north London, a prosperous area that counts A-list celebrities as residents, a triangle of land opposite Michael’s Grade II-listed house has been festooned with a growing number of offerings.In a statement on his official website, members of Michael’s family, including his sisters, Mel and Yioda, father Jack and friend David Austin, said they had been touched by the tributes celebrating and remembering Yog – their nickname for Michael. “However, we feel we cannot expect our Highgate and Goring neighbours to continue to accept as normality, the memorials so personal to you all, to remain as and where they are any longer,” they said.The statement asked Michael fans, who call themselves “Lovelies”, to pick up their tributes by 27 May and make a donation to charity instead, “so we can return both Mill Cottage and The Grove to their former simple state”. “This will take time to do properly, so we ask for your patience while trying to improve the grass and railings at The Grove,” it said.The family added that Michael liked his privacy and “would not want to disturb or change the quiet neighbourhoods he so loved, for the people in the local area who, honestly, despite reports otherwise have been gracious and very understanding”.The houses on Michael’s road in Highgate face the famous Flask pub and are one of the area’s biggest attractions. Former residents include the 19th-century poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Sting, Annie Lennox, Kate Moss and the late Victoria Wood. At the end of last year, Susan Rose, the chair of the Highgate Conservation Area advisory committee, wondered what Michael “would think of it all outside the beautiful home that he looked after so well, and right where he erected a wonderful Christmas tree every year”.No permanent memorial to Michael exists. Fans have campaigned for a lifesize bronze statue of the singer on the land outside his Highgate property. But though the campaign was backed by Michael’s record label, Sony, and local councillors, his family decided against the statue, saying he was a private person and would consider such a gesture “embarrassing”. The Highgate Society planning committee has also said proposals for a statue were “problematic”. “We are hoping, into the future, to get back to you with some more thoughts on ways and ideas to remember Yog that we hope you’ll like, and be a part of,” Michael’s family said in their statement. Annette McHail, who lays flowers near Michael’s Mill Cottage home in Goring every week, told the BBC the decision would “put the house back to how George would like it”. “He was a private person and I can appreciate what the family are saying. It needs to go back to normal now,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a511a30b63750f7be54ee6107ab243b592c01f/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d99ff1ab81566beb7b9717050cbf579","title":"i miss the old kanye what has happened to raps most complex star","story":"His suggestion that black people have been complicit in their own slavery has prompted widespread outrage. What lies behind Kanye West’s recent provocations?Photograph: Smallz \u0026amp RaskindContour by Getty ImageIn a video viewed more than 6m times on Twitter, 21-year-old Chika Oranika summed up the current feelings of many black Americans about Kanye West. She delivered her own lyrics over the beat of the rap star’s Jesus Walks. “How you say you Yeezus but do nothing to restore us? You support the people up in power that abort us,” she raps into the camera. “It don’t matter how much money you got or you lack, when that cheque clear don’t forget that your children are still black.”Why the opprobrium, which has come from activists, Hollywood stars and fellow musicians, as well as withering online freestyles? West, one of the most significant, complex and celebrated rappers in the US, has used a 350-tweet stream of consciousness over the past fornight to throw his support firmly behind Donald Trump. But yesterday, he went way beyond party politics in an interview with TMZ, saying, in a sloppy bit of rhetoric: “You hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.”Host Van Lathan tore back at him: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Roxane Gay reacted on Twitter by calling his comments “dangerous” and “trite, shallow … he is not a free thinker. He is a free moron.”In response, R\u0026ampB singer Frank Ocean emerged from hibernation with a sarcastic screengrab of the time West went off-script during a 2005 Hurricane Katrina appeal to say “George Bush doesn’t care about black people”, the intimation being that it is now West who doesn’t care. Samuel L Jackson suggested West was courting an audience in “the sunken place” – the psychic interzone in the horror film Get Out into which black people are hypnotised and silenced (the film’s director, Jordan Peele, has previously linked it to Trump’s America).“So many people who love you feel so betrayed right know because they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of colour,” West’s friend John Legend wrote in a text message that West posted on Twitter. The rap star wrote back: “You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.” Among ordinary Americans, meanwhile, there was seething anger at West supporting someone who has said “laziness is a trait in blacks” who campaigned for the death penalty for the black teenagers, later proven innocent, in the Central Park Five case and who thought there were some “very fine people” marching alongside neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.Reacting to – or having perhaps anticipated – all this, West released a new track, Ye Vs the People, the first music from two new albums being released in June. In a dialogue with the American people (vocalised by rapper T.I.), Kanye tries to detoxify the Trump brand and reclaim his Make America Great Again slogan: “Wearin’ the hat’ll show people that we equal,” he raps, arguing for a why-can’t-we-all-just-get-along humanism. He ultimately distils the debate thus: “You on some choosin’ side shit, I’m on some unified shit.”For Kanye, this chapter is just the latest incident in an uncompromising career. At the turn of the century, as a beatmaker for Jay-Z and others, he really did seem to be on “some unified shit”, taking the chopped-up soul samples of “backpack” hip-hop and pairing them with the blockbuster tropes of mainstream rap production he then successfully segued into being a unified producer-rapper. His first two albums charmed the whole spectrum of rap fans with their ersity and humour: he riffed on black cultural reference points – slow-jam love songs, social climbers – like a standup comedian.His albums became more ambitious with each new release, unifying erse cultural reference points – Graduation sampled Daft Punk and explored a more electronic sound 808s \u0026amp Heartbreak used Auto-Tune to reflect and enact emotional dissonance, to brilliant effect My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was as operatic as the title suggests. His interest in visual art grew, with artists from Takashi Murakami to George Condo commissioned for his album covers he designed his own fashion collections and collaborated with Adidas. In 2013, he said: “Creative genius, that’s my title. My title is not rapper any more.” West positioned himself as a rounded aesthete, obsessed with form and how art impacts society – his Twitter feed has recently featured everything from tech solutions for water desalination to artists Joseph Beuys and David Hammons. Part of his attraction to Kardashian seemed to be her very iconography: “My girl a superstar all from a home movie”, he wondered admiringly on 2012 track Clique.He also continued his analysis of black America. On the same track he raps: “You know white people get money, don’t spend it  Or maybe they get money, buy a business  I’d rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant.” West sees himself as celebrating the economic freedom black Americans were denied for decades, and to which they still have much less access than whites. It’s an extension of a key Jay-Z line – “I do this for my culture, to let ’em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roadster” – from Izzo (HOVA), a track that Kanye produced.And since Yeezus, his self-obsession has become stifling. His 2016 album The Life of Pablo has a great skit called I Love Kanye, where he imagines: “What if Kanye made a song about Kanye called I Miss the Old Kanye? Man, that’d be so Kanye!”In the wake of his slavery comments, the skit stops being funny: black people really do miss the old, outward-looking Kanye. Rapper Meek Mill summed up the thoughts of many when he posted an image of Kanye to Instagram yesterday, surrounded by the words “RIP Old Kanye” and quoting Kanye’s lyrics back at him: “I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny  And what I do? Act more stupidly.”The problem is that Kanye’s self-scrutiny has become so advanced that he is beginning to see the world purely through the prism of Kanye, rather than the eyes of black America. That’s harmful not just to himself, but to an ongoing civil rights struggle in a still-racist US his provocations have the potential to embolden the alt-right and others who would diminish the standing of African Americans.Like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, both figures he admires, it’s hard to place Kanye on to a left-right political binary. His personal political philosophy doesn’t neatly dovetail with existing belief systems – witness how the alt-right embraced him after his championing of Trump, and then deserted him when he also championed Parkland shooting survivor and activist Emma Gonzalez last weekend.Any analysis is complicated by West’s hospitalisation for two weeks in 2016 after a mental breakdown, following intense touring and an incident where Kardashian was robbed in Paris. He has recast the episode as a “breakthrough” and says he is using medication that “helps calm me down” Kardashian has expressed frustration at how Kanye is framed as mentally ill when he is “just being himself when he has always been expressive”. And of course, there is a long history of black people being dismissed as crazy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68d32b6ced74c706f79555e56617d4ed1e0bf8ae/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=44291d3f17d84a60a2a4fd93815a9772 1760w","title":"blah blah blah has pmqs ever felt so utterly pointless","story":"With Jeremy Corbyn failing to score easy goals on Windrush and the customs union, it was not even a hostile environmentIf we’re very lucky we’ll soon wake up to discover the past two years has been like the series finale of Dallas in which everything that had happened in previous episodes had merely been a bad dream. But until then we have to assume that the political leaders we have are real and treat them as such. Something that is getting harder by the day as they find new ways of redefining mediocrity. Each week the bar seems to get lower and still Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are unable to clear it.With the government in chaos over both Windrush and the customs union, prime minister’s questions should have been a stroll in the park for the Labour leader. A chance to make May look weak with a series of well-aimed jabs before Thursday’s local elections in England. And initially it looked as if Corbyn had understood the brief as he got to the heart of the government’s difficulties by asking if the prime minister felt guilty that Amber Rudd had been forced to resign for her own failures.Even though the question can’t have come as a surprise, May found herself unable to answer it. A look of confusion crossed her face as the two synapses of her brain tried to establish a connection.No joy. Instead she glanced at her notes and started reading out a statement about how she was going to do the bare minimum to investigate what had gone wrong in the Home Office – if only she could remember who had been in charge for six years – and hoped that everybody would apologise to her when the inquiry, whose results she already had in her possession, found that she had done nothing wrong.Corbyn didn’t appear to notice that his question had gone unanswered and retreated back to his script. Blah, blah, blah, the economy. And this set the pattern for the rest of the exchanges. Time and again the Labour leader would have the prime minister on the ropes – on Home Office deportation targets, on her own decision to deny visas for people wanting to fill the 100,000 vacancies in the NHS – and each time he would let the moment slip by meandering on to another topic. Blah, blah, the NHS. Blah, blah, blah, education. Blah, blah, blah, police cuts.It eventually became clear that Corbyn had no real interest in asking the prime minister any questions. Not because he already knew she was incapable of answering them, but because he was really only concerned with collecting a series of video clips of him shouting about all the things he didn’t like about the Tories that he could post online to try and boost the Labour vote in the local elections. All of which suited May just fine as she was free to say whatever she liked without fear of being contradicted. The Maybot is as the Maybot does.PMQs had seldom felt quite so pointless and the session quickly descended into near farce when it emerged that no one else had any questions for her either. Tory Eurosceptic Peter Bone forgot his disagreements with her over the EU, hailed Theresa as the Brexit queen and declared his intention of building a statue to her. A fitting monument to the patron saint of hopelessness.There was a hint of tension when Amber Rudd rose to make her first intervention from the backbenches, but it soon became clear she was going to abide by her non-disclosure agreement. Though she looked demob happy – it must be a relief to no longer have to clean up after Theresa – she declared her undying devotion to the prime minister. May responded in kind, saying Amber should be very proud of having screwed up and implying that her failure would be rewarded with a return to the front bench before long.Only a couple of SNP and Labour backbenchers came close to putting May on the spot. Inevitably, her algorithms went into a meltdown and she started barking staccato bursts of nonsense. The hostile environment wasn’t really hostile, it was just compliantly unfriendly. The customs union would be resolved by ine intervention. “We’ve been very clear,” she said to general derision. She hadn’t, of course. Then she never is. But on this occasion it hadn’t really mattered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3533b1788ea3cab233d6681f0212b00eb146c37/0_353_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11f46b285b727c8d88b18b7becc99b4b","title":"local elections havering brexit stronghold immigration less of an issue now","story":"Local election Labour candidates say crime and housing have moved up the list of concernsLast summer a row erupted over Havering council’s plan to split from the rest of London. The motion, tabled by a Ukip councillor and dubbed “Hexit”, was an attempt to solve the east London borough’s so-called “identity crisis”.“It was laughed out of the chamber,” says Fay Hough, the 30-year-old Labour candidate for the Rainham \u0026amp Wennington ward in the upcoming local elections, “because there were no positives. We would have lost funding, the London living wage, even the Freedom pass.”The vote, Hough adds, was part of a trend in which Labour’s opposition has billed the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, as a figure of dislike from whom they want a orce. A recent Tory campaign to “Keep Havering Safe”, for example, was accused of “dog-whistle racism” after leaflets were distributed warning that the borough could soon resemble erse “inner city” areas under Khan.“I think there are local politicians who are playing on people’s fear of difference,” says Kim Arrowsmith, another Labour candidate.“The demographic of the area is changing, and over time that will make that kind of politics very difficult to sell. The fear will dissipate.”Immigration, the candidates say, is less of an issue now, with housing and crime coming up most often on the doorstep. “We’ve got a bidding system for council housing which is seen as not-fit-for-purpose,” says Arrowsmith. “And a lot of privately rented places aren’t accepting benefits any more. What I find comes up a lot is single mums who can’t work full-time but can’t rent a place.”“And I’ve had a few people who say ‘my 28-year-old daughter’s still living with me at home, there’s no way she can afford to move in on her own’,” says Hough, who has been volunteering for local MP Jon Cruddas’s office for two years.Havering is no stranger to regeneration, and estates are being knocked down to make way for new developments. But Labour say there are no assurances of right to return. The borough is also the site of Orchard Village, a housing development so plagued with issues related to building quality that it has faced calls for demolition.On the streets of Rainham, which the candidates call “the forgotten part of Havering”, most of the people who open the door are friendly and responsive.“Crime often comes up,” says Nicholas West, a 23-year-old prospective Labour councillor. “The anxiety last summer was so extreme because of moped robberies. Knife crime has been an issue too. When I was growing up I had youth centres to go to, now there’s nothing for the kids. Over the Easter holidays the kids are just on the street bored. And that’s when they’re most vulnerable to being taken in by gangs.”A police station in the area had to recently shut because of cuts, West adds. All this plays into the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s strategy of putting housing and crime at the heart of his party’s bid to take over Tory local authorities. Such national politics can work for and against the local candidates on the doorstep, Arrowsmith says. “People sometimes say ‘you’re all the same’. National politics helped with that, because no one can say Labour and the Tories are the same any more. We’re seeing a much more positive picture because voters are ready for change. Jeremy represents a break from the past. The Tories really targeted Dagenham and Rainham in the general election but Jon Cruddas’ majority went up.”As we’re walking through Rainham, one woman stops us in the street. “Just so you know I’ll be voting Labour,” she says. “I’m a new member. I’ve worked in the public sector for 15 years. I just thought I’d stop you and say good luck.”“I swear we did not set that up,” Hough says cheerfully afterwards. “People are becoming more aware now. When I was door-knocking for Brexit, a few houses had massive Ukip posters saying ‘vote leave’. “I’ve door-knocked them recently and they’re all Labour. Work that one out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057857ae79fdc8debea6aac283ec5f894b243751/0_120_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=484d0fddc2089749f4b670e36b46deb1","title":"sajid javid joins hard brexiters to derail pm on customs plan","story":"Inner cabinet fails to agree stance as home secretary opposes May’s proposalSajid Javid has joined hard-Brexiters to voice strong doubts about the prime minister’s favoured customs plan as her Brexit inner cabinet broke up without agreement on the government’s negotiating stance.Just days after replacing Amber Rudd as home secretary in the wake of the Windrush crisis, Javid staked out his independence from Theresa May by suggesting her favoured model of a “customs partnership” was unworkable and throwing his weight behind the alternative preferred by the hard-Brexit faction.Downing Street sources insisted the customs partnership, which would see the UK levy tariffs on behalf of Brussels, had not been formally rejected.But Rudd’s departure appears to have left the key cabinet subcommittee deadlocked over how to negotiate Britain’s departure from the EU.During the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, Javid added his voice to those of Liam Fox, David Davis, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, all of whom expressed concerns about May’s preferred approach.“They’ve lost and they know it, and they’re trying to find a way out,” said one senior Brexiter. “It’s a dead parrot.”Allies of Javid suggested that while he had concerns about the customs partnership, he was not signalling that he would automatically support the hard-Brexiters in future.The Bromsgrove MP backed the remain camp during the 2016 general election – but he is a longtime Eurosceptic. Before he was appointed home secretary, he waded into the row about whether the UK should remain in a customs union, tweeting, “British people gave politicians clear instructions through EU referendum. Includes leaving the Customs Union, an intrinsic part of the EU.”The hard-Brexiters prefer an alternative, maximum facilitation, or “max fac”, proposal, which relies on technology to keep border-checks to a minimum, and Javid gave them his backing at the meeting on Wednesday, regarding this plan as more practical.Brussels has expressed reservations about both proposals, and dismissed the government’s approach to resolving the Irish border problem as “magical thinking”. Talks on Britain’s future relationship with the EU27 are essentially deadlocked, as Brussels awaits a steer from the government about which plan it wants to pursue.Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “We are 331 days until UK becomes a third country under EU law, and the government can’t decide between two options already rejected by the other side of the negotiation. It is farcical. The Brexit war cabinet is more like a warring cabinet that is split completely down the middle. They have no plan and no clue.” understands neither of the two options will go forward in their present format to the meeting of the whole cabinet next week.Instead, No 10 is expected to do some more detailed work on both options and recall the Brexit subcommittee in a few days’ time, raising the prospect that May could return with an amended “hybrid plus” model, that could be more acceptable.“They’re both serious proposals, and they both pose a different set of challenges, which need to be addressed,” a Downing Street source said.While no vote was taken, Brexit sources claimed the balance of the meeting was 6-5 against a customs partnership, with defence secretary Gavin Williamson also “leaning away” from it.The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, spoke critically of the customs partnership, but was not vocal in favour of the max-fac option either, one source said. “He wasn’t leading the charge against it, but both he and Sajid made clear that they had significant reservations about the partnership option.” Hard-Brexit sources added that May appeared “genuinely surprised” at the “robust” interventions from colleagues sceptical about the partnership approach.However, proponents of a soft Brexit countered that with chief whip Julian Smith present, there were 12 people in the room – although Smith is understood not to have made his stance clear.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, and his allies fear the “max fac” approach would not meet the government’s pledge of avoiding a hard border in Ireland.Peers inflicted a fresh defeat on the government in the House of Lords over the Irish border issue on Wednesday evening, backing a cross-party amendment supported by former Tory minister Chris Patten.The amendment would commit the government to avoiding any Brexit deal that would jeopardise the Good Friday agreement, and passed by 309 to 242, a majority of 67 and the latest of a series of hefty losses on the withdrawal bill.When the legislation comes back to the Commons, the government is likely to urge MPs to vote to reject this and a series of other amendments, including one aimed at forcing them to pursue a customs union.May has delayed a series of contentious votes, including on the customs and trade bills, to which backbenchers have laid a series of amendments aimed at keeping the option of a full customs union with the EU on the table.A customs union, which is now Labour’s policy, would allow tariff free trade with the EU after Brexit, but would commit Britain to imposing EU tariffs on goods coming from outside the EU and prevent it from striking independent trade deals.Cabinet ministers at Wednesday’s Brexit subcommittee were unamimous in favour of the government’s policy of leaving the customs union, Downing Street sources said.They said May had underlined the fact that remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit would leave Britain with less power over its own trade policy than it has today.During the meeting, sources said business secretary Greg Clark and Hammond both sought to impress on their colleagues the urgency of providing business with a clear answer to the question of what customs arrangements they are likely to face in future.Brexit secretary Davis and Eurosceptic colleagues believe the customs partnership would be cumbersome and bureaucratic – while backbench leavers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, claim that it would be “deeply unsatisfactory”.Mogg’s European Research Group submitted a 30-page report to No 10 in advance of Wednesday’s meeting setting out the model’s shortcomings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abd8a8bdb4a4e9f16b3d20718c4cc542ae923e83/0_280_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3fd2ad47eed5bd1f1ebae54d860d10c","title":"secrets of resilience womans extraordinary trauma survival carmen tarleton","story":"Carmen Tarleton was so badly beaten and burned by her ex-husband that she needed 38 operations and a face transplant. Yet she found a path back to happiness. What helps her – and others like her – retain their essential optimism?I met Bohdan Pomohač, one of her surgeons, at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “In terms of injuries inflicted by another human being, it’s certainly one of the worst I’ve ever seen,” he told me. Her face was almost completely destroyed her family were able to recognise it was Carmen only by her teeth.When people experience terrible head injuries, doctors can put them into a barbiturate coma in order to shut down brain function. This prevents the brain from damaging itself further by trying to keep going without an adequate blood supply.“Even when I first woke up from the coma I just knew it was such a big event, and it was so strange, that it had other meanings for me,” she says. “I could help a lot of people.”Carmen started doing inspirational speaking. “I looked terrible and people felt so sorry for me, but I wanted to show people it didn’t matter what I looked like,” she says. Photos of Carmen from that time are shocking with all the grafts, she didn’t have proper eyelids, and her eyeballs looked out through small circular holes cut into the skin. She had synthetic corneas and couldn’t blink, and the edges of the skin were red raw.“It forced me to look at the big picture of what life is really about,” she says. “And that’s where I’ve had to go, because this horrific event occurred and I found a way through it. And not because I’m different or special, but because that’s what was meant to be: to show people you can be involved in these incredible events and you can forgive, totally, and move on.”She says she has forgiven her now-ex husband for what he did. (In return for pleading guilty to maiming, he accepted a sentence of 30 to 70 years in prison. He died in prison in December 2017.) “I was never religious,” she says. “I took responsibility for my life. I was not responsible for what happened, for what he chose to do, but I certainly was responsible from that day forward.”Even after leaving hospital, Carmen was still in a lot of pain. The injuries to her skin and the multiple grafts caused tightness when they healed, and this led to all sorts of secondary problems with the mobility of her neck and spine. Still she kept going.Then, on Valentine’s Day 2013, Carmen’s life changed again. She became only the seventh American to undergo a complete face transplant. The operation was performed by Pomohač.Pomohač says that for a long time he didn’t think of Carmen as a candidate for face transplant, because she was so immunologically challenged. All those grafts and transfusions had primed her body to attack almost any donated tissue. But there were several pressing reasons why she needed a new face. The pain and the narcotics, yes, but as well as that, the opening on to her eyeball was getting bigger, and this was threatening the integrity of the synthetic cornea. Then there was the drooling, and the problems with speaking and eating.It’s possible there is a psychological force that carries people through … Sometimes people can surprise you with their resilienceThe operation was a technical success, but then there was the immune system to deal with. Carmen’s body mounted a massive rejection of the face and, for a period of four weeks after the operation, she was pumped up on numerous immunosuppressants. By then there was only one more drug left to use. A full dose would help suppress the rejection, but would also completely wipe out her immune system, to such an extent that any trivial infection would kill her. In the end, with Carmen’s consent, they gave her a little of that final drug it was enough to tame her immune system. She got better. Carmen says she felt she had made a choice to live.“It’s possible there is a psychological force that carries people through, but my official answer has to be that the statistics were still a little bit in our favour,” says Pomohač. “Sometimes people can surprise you with their resilience.”Carmen suffered physical injuries that could easily have killed her. That she survived is remarkable in itself, but what seems even more incredible is how she has not just survived mentally, but developed into someone else – someone who, by her own account, is better.Before, she was a registered nurse and was raising children, and, until her incident, she had not thought about the big questions of life: “I wasn’t going to sit around and complain and cry.” Carmen now says she wouldn’t go back and change what happened: she has grown too much. It is a pattern seen in others who have suffered an incredible trauma, and found a way through it.How do they do it? For physical trauma, it is not so mysterious that some people survive. As Pomohač says, statistically, some people will just make it through. When they do, we are so surprised that we fixate on it, and may even call it miraculous. We remember these people, the extraordinary survivors such as Gabrielle Giffords, and we don’t just shrug and say, “Well, it’s not impossible to survive even being shot in the head.” Statistics aside, medical care is good and the body is capable of amazing repair – perhaps better than we might give it credit for.But it is the mental resilience that is sometimes more impressive. Carmen tells me that we get too caught up in negativity. You’ve got to take control, and make your own choices. “I don’t live like the typical person on the inside at all,” she says. “I have different beliefs that help me go when I’m going.”Some people can ride out trauma and even prosper, when others suffer lingering physiological stress and fear – the hallmarks of post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychiatrist David Wolfe is head of outpatient services at the evocatively named Building of Transformative Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The funny thing, he tells me, is that the people who suffer trauma but actually come out better aren’t the people who are studied. If someone is coping well, they are sent home. Psychiatrists see the people who struggle. But perhaps, he says, people don’t suffer as much as we think.“Psychiatry has been as guilty of this as anyone. You assume that, if something bad happens to someone, they’re going to have some mental problem. It happens when we see patients in hospital with very serious diseases. We think: ‘They must be depressed – wouldn’t you be?’ But, actually, they’re not.”That is not to say, of course, that people don’t suffer and don’t need treatment. According to the United States National Center for PTSD, seven or eight out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. What Wolfe is saying is that it is wrong to assume a traumatic event will be the same for everyone. More often than not it’s more impressive how well people cope with trauma, which makes sense from an evolutionary point of view: it is advantageous to have hidden powers of resilience. “The ability to power through adverse conditions should be there in our DNA,” Wolfe says. “It’s more of a puzzle why, from an evolutionary standpoint, we have problems with that sometimes.”No one does things like this alone, without the friends and family who rally round. Your social network is key to how you deal with trauma. “People who respond well tend to have positive relationships in their life and that translates into positive relationships with their treatment teams,” says Wolfe.One of Carmen’s sisters moved to Boston so she could see her every day while she recovered, even before she came out of the coma. When Carmen left hospital, years before the face transplant, she went to her family. She saw a therapist for a while after she was attacked, but she says her experience was so far off the chart that nobody knew what to say to her. “I cried at my sister’s and my mother’s and bitched a little, and after a year and a half I thought, that’s not going to help me.”I needed to find a way through this … My biggest motivation was that I wanted to be a role model to my daughtersOptimism, not surprisingly, is one of the character traits shared by people who respond well to trauma. “The opposite is hopelessness, which is a feature of depression,” says Wolfe. “Engagement, taking it on, taking on responsibility, and being active in the process – these things go a long way.”When you ask people what keeps them going, Wolfe says, the number one answer is family and kids. People who are resilient look to the future. Carmen had a clear goal: “I needed to find a way through this, because I wasn’t going to go anywhere. I was raising children, there were things I wanted to do. My biggest motivation was that I wanted to be a role model to my daughters.”What about the genetics of resilience? Even when we find genes related to disease, it rarely works on the basis that “you have the gene, you’ll get the disease”. Sure, there are instances, such as familial Alzheimer’s or cystic fibrosis, where this is almost always the case, but most diseases, and almost all traits, are far more complex, and are influenced by many genes. Resilience is one such complex trait.The capacity to be super-resilient may be there even in normal people, but we need guidance and support to find it, maybe from psychotherapy, maybe from friends. We need help to be optimistic, encouragement to take control, and empowerment to be responsible. We need a certain amount of self-love. A touch of narcissism is good. We need to stand up for ourselves so we are not mistreated at work or in relationships, we need to be assertive without devaluing others and have a self-image that is positive without being conceited. This mixture of personality traits will drive you forward. And, if you do not have them naturally, some of them can be constructed.Extracted from Superhuman: Life at the Extremes of Mental and Physical Ability by Rowan Hooper, published by Little, Brown on 3 May, price £14.99 (rrp).

The policy recognised that the cost of making brownfield sites useable could make some places unviable for development. Ministers believed that targeted interventions could help increase housebuilding at the bottom of the market where the affordability crisis had bitten most deeply and particularly affected millennials.In January 2017, Gavin Barwell, then housing minister, , said the first homes would be built that year after partnership agreements with 30 local authorities.He said: “This first wave of partnerships shows the strong local interest to build thousands of starter homes on hundreds of brownfield sites in the coming years. One in three councils has expressed an interest to work with us so far.”However, after Raab confirmed that “£250m of the starter homes land fund has been spent to date”, a spokesman for his department said, adding: “At the moment no specific starter homes have been built yet.”The government has now placed the operation of the flagship fund under review.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmen, said: “We have spent £250m buying land to build affordable properties, and work is underway getting them ready for development. It is important we get starter homes right and we aim to introduce regulations on them alongside our new planning policy before building gets underway.”It’s a not-for-profit organisation run by local residents that develops genuinely affordable housing.It originates from India where, under the\u0026nbspgramdan\u0026nbspsystem, villagers can choose to hold their land as a collective. It was then exported to America and from there to the UK.Often, yes, because land in cities is so expensive. But some of the most interesting schemes in Britain today are in cities. In north London, the StART community land trust proposes to take over a big chunk of a hospital site and build 800 genuinely affordable homes. It’s a serious proposal, as even the politicians accept. The trouble is, they need hundreds of millions to buy the land.Healey said: “There are now a million fewer home owners under 45 than in 2010 but the Tories are doing too little to give working people on ordinary incomes a hand up. Ministers should get a grip and back Labour’s plan to help first-time buyers with first dibs on new homes for local people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/206768a3dc33daa57f925f216194f73581eade47/0_147_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=845fc64fd8a46cf1f7d68abaa2185f94","title":"identifying peanut allergies cheaper and easier with new test","story":"Scientists says blood test could avoid costly, stressful, food tests for confirming allergyA new blood test could make it much easier and cheaper to identify children with peanut allergies, say scientists.Peanut allergy is usually confirmed using a skin-prick test, thought unreliable, and the “oral food challenge” – a time-consuming process which involves feeding increasingly larger amounts of peanuts.The blood test could act as a second-line tool when skin-prick tests were inconclusive and before referring children for the feeding schedule, the researchers said.“The new test is specific in confirming the diagnosis, so when it’s positive we can be very sure it means allergy. We would reduce by two-thirds the number of expensive, stressful, oral food challenges conducted, as well as saving children from experiencing allergic reactions.”Food allergy symptoms, such as itching skin, stomach cramps and constriction of the throat and airways, are triggered when food proteins interact with an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE). Standard skin-prick tests measure the presence of IgE antibodies.The new test focuses on mast cells which are activated by IgE in blood plasma they produce biomarkers associated with allergic reactions which can be detected in the lab.The scientists are already looking at expanding the work to provide a way of diagnosing other food allergies. Santos said: “We are adapting this test to other foods, such as milk, eggs, sesame and tree nuts.

The result of his anti-doping case is expected some time between the finish of this race on 21 May and the start of the Tour de France in July.But while the Team Sky principal, Dave Brailsford, wore a battle-weary look on another bruising day for his operation, the top rider breezed through his questions in Jerusalem seemingly carefree and confident.Before it even reaches Italy the Giro will have to confront myriad controversies, from the decision to hold the start in Israel, to the spectre of a visiting Lance Armstrong, banned from contesting official cycling events but recording a podcast in the shadows. Then there is Froome, the favourite, attempting to be the first rider since Bernard Hinault to hold all three grand tour titles at the same time and possessing a remarkable ability to compartmentalise.He is contesting a failed drug test at last year’s Vuelta a España, where a urine sample indicated twice the permitted level of the asthma medication salbutamol in his system but to witness his relaxed manner, you would not realise it. “I need to demonstrate that I’ve done nothing wrong and that’s what I intend to do,” he said. “It’s not something I’m going to give a running commentary on, and when there is something new we’ll talk about it.”David Lappartient, the president of the UCI, world cycling’s governing body, as well as several high-profile riders, have expressed misgivings that Froome continues to compete, already doing so three times this year. There is no doubt his presence has once more overshadowed the race. Apart from a few questions, one planted by the Israeli tourist board, the discussion was dominated by the fog of doubt over Team Sky.It was the first time Brailsford had held court since a damning report by government’s department of culture, media and sport select committee (DCMS) suggested Team Sky abused the anti-doping system to allow the administration of performance-enhancing drugs.Coming after the mystery Jiffy bag delivery to Bradley Wiggins in 2011, Brailsford admits he has considered his position at the top of a team created on an ethos of total transparency and zero tolerance for drugs. But he resolved to remain. “I think anybody in this game considers their position every day,” he said. “I would say that I’m constantly asking if I’m the right man to lead these guys. I think that regardless of the DCMS or anything else, there’s a constant sense of self-questioning about whether I’m appropriately placed or do I have the right skills. Some things come and go, the situation and context around you changes, but I’m here because I think I am still in the position where I can help these guys be the best they can be.”Froome and Team Sky are being paid a reported €1.4m (£1.23m) in appearance fees by Giro d’Italia organisers and have the opportunity to make history, so their motivations for being here are manifold. But Brailsford refused to answer whether he would sack Froome should he be suspended for an anti-doping rule violation. “That’s not a question for now,” he said. “We have to respect the race.” But for all the team who want to keep the focus on the main event, that is the uncomfortable situation they are in.The organisers have also been accused of “sport-washing” by allowing the start to be held in Israel. Critics claim it is an attempt to ert attention from the killing and maiming of Palestinians on the Gaza Strip.Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s director, said: “We’re not going to tell the Giro D’Italia organisers where they should and shouldn’t start the race, but the Jerusalem launch inevitably means Israel’s dismal human rights record is going to be in the spotlight.“The authoritiesin Jerusalem may have thought that the glitz of the Giro D’Italia might have a sportswash effect, removing some of the stain of Israel’s human rights record. Instead, it’s likely to bring it back into focus yet again.”The Giro D’Italia riders will begin the race only weeks after the Israeli security forces unleashed excessive, deadly force against Palestinian protesters in Gaza, including children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf1939131cb1648aab456809601314e181797efe/0_325_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc1722b0d900b165148ad0fc25b8f59","title":"tesla loss model 3 elon musk","story":"Elon Musk got testy with analysts amid concerns over company’s future, after it burned through $745.3m in cash during important quarterTesla posted a record $709.6m net loss in the first quarter and burned through $745.3m in cash while struggling to crank out large numbers of its Model 3 mass-market electric car.The loss and cash burn announced Wednesday raised questions about the company’s future and whether it would be able to pay all of its bills by early next year without more borrowing or another round of stock sales.During a sometimes-testy conference call with analysts, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, conceded that criticism was valid but said it was “quite likely” the company would make money and have positive cash flow in the third quarter.“It’s high time we became profitable,” said Musk, who also promised restructuring this month to achieve profit goals. “The truth is you’re not a real company until you are, frankly. That’s our focus right now.”Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call with analysts, when Musk began cutting analysts’ questions short, costing Tesla over $2bn in market capitalization. “These questions are so dry. They’re killing me,” Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off. He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring. The giant loss in a critical quarter for the 15-year-old company fell short of Wall Street estimates. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss of $3.54 per share. Revenue, however, exceeded estimates of $3.28bn.In April, Tesla said it would not need to return to markets for more capital because it expected to generate cash from sales of the Model 3. But it has had trouble getting them out the door to several hundred thousand people who put down $1,000 deposits to order one.Moody’s Investor Service downgraded Tesla’s debt into junk territory back in March, warning at the time that Tesla didn’t have cash to cover $3.7bn for normal operations, capital expenses and debt that come due early next year. At the end of last year the company had a total of $9.5bn in long-term debt.“The negative outlook reflects the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall,” Moody’s wrote in a note to investors.Tesla has had only two profitable quarters in its nearly eight years as a public company.The key to raising cash to cover expenses is production of the Model 3 mass-market electric car, which starts at $35,000 but can easily top $50,000 with options. Musk said the restructuring would involve getting rid of third-party contractors that have grown out of control. “We’re going to scrub barnacles on that front,” he said.He admitted that Tesla made a mistake by adding too much automation too quickly at the factory.The plant has missed Musk’s forecasts by a wide mark. When production started last summer he promised to build 20,000 Model 3s during the month of December. Instead, Tesla made only 2,425 during the entire fourth quarter.Then Tesla forecast 10,000 Model 3s per month at the end of the first quarter. As it turned out, just under 9,800 were assembled from January through March, Tesla said in April. The Fremont, California factory was shut down for four or five days last month to clear production bottlenecks, Tesla said.The company, which also makes solar panels, predicted in April that production would climb rapidly through the second quarter and reach about 5,000 vehicles per week – which would return Tesla to its originally promised 20,000 per month rate – around the end of June. It predicted high sales and strong cash flow in the third quarter. “As a result Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,” the company said.The Model 3 is the most important piece of Tesla’s plan to become a mainstream automaker. At one point it had more than 500,000 potential buyers on a waiting list. But in April the company conceded that some had canceled, although it refused to give numbers. Tesla said reservations “remained stable” through the first quarter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a450dc78fec791ba5b9d7ef0d96868386ba2310/0_285_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4822905e2a8f46d3c4b5a37b2587ecf","title":"love in the countryside review sara cox gives farmers a hand finding rural romance","story":"Sara Cox is busy. She has barely finished going Back in Time For Tea, now she is helping lonely farmers find love. As well as her Radio 2 stuff. I don’t mind, there’s no such thing as too much Sara Cox.So eight farmers uploaded video profiles, and prospective partners were invited to write them letters. Letters! What is this, the past? Do they not have Tinder and Grindr in the countryside?Whatever, Sara delivers them their letters from which they have to whittle down a shortlist. Thirty-two-year-old Christine (sheep and cattle, Dumfries and Galloway, took over the farm when her dad died, runs it by herself) doesn’t have much whittling to do, there aren’t many letters in her box … Oh God, already I can’t bear this. She’s lovely, what’s wrong with you idiots?Ed (dairy, Lancashire) has loads of letters, he needs an extra box. That’s because Ed’s 25, gorgeous, charming, attentive, has perfect teeth … yawn. Likewise Heather (vet, North Yorkshire) – 28, tall, blond, horsey, she’ll be fighting them off.Peter (52, also North Yorks) is good news, though. I mean from a TV perspective rather than to move in with. Divorcee (can’t imagine what went wrong) Peter is what you want in a farmer on a show like this. Mucky hands, old-fashioned shirt and matching views. “Cows are probably better behaved than women, aren’t they?” he says.Peter soon finds a letter from someone he likes the sound of – well, the look of first, it’s the photo that catches his attention. “Ay up, this is a right corker this,” he says. “An absolute cracker!”I wonder what he sees in Francesca, who is 16 years younger than he is and who writes that she was immediately attracted to his round masculine features, then apologises that her perfumed, kiss-sealed letter is a bit crumpled but she was dripping wet, fresh from the shower when she wrote it.The others roll their eyes. Back at home, Peter’s family roll theirs. “She looks maybe a little bit too glamorous. I don’t think she’s maybe the country sort,” says Peter’s nephew. His two teenage sons like the look of Christina, who isn’t just attractive, and of a similar age to their dad, but she also worked on a dairy farm for several years. It’s almost as if they suspect Francesca’s motives might have more to do with a primetime TV appearance than actually looking for a new rural life – and love – on the farm. Guess what? Francesca goes on the definite pile – as she was always going to the moment Peter saw her – and it doesn’t matter what anybody else thinks.There’s an interview process – not the most successful part of this it’s awkward and old school. There’s something of Blind Date about it, with our farmers asking the same questions to their prospective partners in order to whittle down further. “What are you looking for in a relationship?” Peter asks each potential Mrs Peter. (The best answer is “a man”, from a Geordie lorry driver named Mo). It has none of the natural, date-reality of Channel 4’s First Dates.Coxy does her best to keep it moving along, with bants and a lot of alliteration. And I imagine most of the fun is yet to come, when our potential farmers’ partners go back to the farm, to get up at dawn in order to shovel cowpats, and to pretend to get on with their rivals while obviously really wanting to kill them. Plenty of opportunity for that too. There’s a lot of heavy machinery around, things to be shredded or baled and slurry tanks to drown in, bulls …Decision time for Peter. Oh, Christina – his sons’ favourite, with cow experience – doesn’t make the final cut. Nor Mo. Francesca? She does, as it happens. More eye-rolling. And possibly a little thumbs up, under the table, from the programme-makers. Get them wellies on, girl. Something to look forward to next week.I’m also looking forward to finding out how 39-year-old Richard, who is looking for a man, gets on. The gay scene in the Scottish sheep-farming community isn’t brilliant, apparently. And then there’s 52-year-old Norfolk farrier Mark. “One thing I haven’t told anybody yet, is I ain’t got any central heating,” he chuckles. How are you going to resist that ladies, an icy east wind blowing through your Norfolk farmhouse? Now I expect Mark will need an extra box, for all his letters. And will end up with a 27-year-old model called Anastasia.

She had bled for it: as a youth, Horn-Miller nearly died after sustaining a stab wound on the front lines of the Oka Crisis, a 1990 land dispute that grew into a standoff between Canadian soldiers and Mohawk protesters. And she had competed for it: as a Canadian Olympic athlete, she often wore traditional clothing to represent the Mohawk Nation. But her husband, Keith Morgan, is not Mohawk. And in marrying him, she had breached a longstanding rule of the community, informally known as “marry out, get out”.As tensions grew and her name appeared on an eviction list in 2014, she acceded to the demands of the community. She and her family moved to Ottawa.This week, a judge in Quebec struck down the controversial order which had snared Horn-Miller and 16 other plaintiffs. The province’s superior court found that the rule violates Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedom. “This is a kind of rule that wouldn’t be acceptable anywhere else in Canada, because it’s very clearly unconstitutional,” said Geneviève Grey, who was part of Horn-Miller’s legal team.Justice Thomas Davis rejected arguments that the rule – originally implemented in 1981 – was an effective way to preserve Mohawk culture. Instead, he found the it was “grounded in stereotypical belief that non-native spouses will use the resources and land” of the community.“In fact, most, if not all, of the non-native spouses or the family members who have been denied membership … have embraced the Mohawk culture,” he wrote.“Marry out, get out” is rarely enforced, despite being codified as law. But a number of plaintiffs told the court they were harassed and often feared for their personal safety.Terri McComber said the intimidation became “unbearable” after she married Marvin McComber, a member of the band. She testified that protests were held outside the family home she was known as “the white woman”, her children were called “half-breeds”.The judgment also exposed difficult questions surrounding federal jurisdiction and indigenous autonomy. “Indigenous groups really push back against jurisdiction that is unilaterally imposed upon them,” said Naiomi Metallic, a law professor at Dalhousie University. Such clashes over jurisdiction are often the result of communities grappling with rapidly diminishing lands, resources and disappearing traditions, she said.The Kahnawà:ke reserve on the southern banks of the Saint Lawrence river has 8,000 members on 53 sq km of land, – about a third of its original territory. Metallic said roughly a third of First Nations in Canada have rules of some kind to determine who enjoys benefits of treaties.The Mohawk Council of Kahnawà:ke is currently reviewing the decision.“Obviously we maintain the position that matters that are so integral to our identity have no business in outside courts,” said Grand Chief Joseph Norton in a statement. “However, a decision on the case has been rendered. We are now taking the time to analyze the decision and will inform the community further in the coming days.”The law remains isive within the community, and some residents strongly support it. Others simply comply.Terry McComber (no relation to Terri McComber), is a Mohawk woman who recently married a non-native man. “He would never be able to live here. And I wouldn’t want him to live here. We belong on the outside now.”The decision wasn’t easy, she said: “Kahnawà:ke is still my home in my heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d13687b635cb580e93e67a66f5d2763af76162c/0_166_4360_2616/master/4360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=765bccd07da2c8884bd7d1899e6e715f","title":"pakistani army manzoor pashteen pashtun","story":"Manzoor Pashteen’s Pashtun Protection Movement gathers support in country where criticism of army is rareEvery morning Ahmed Shah puts on his circular, red-and-black cap, decorated with spades, and feels ready to take on the world. “For me this cap is a symbol of resistance,” he says. “That’s why I like it.”Shah (not his real name) is one of thousands of Pakistanis who have taken to wearing the distinctive tribal hat to show their support for Manzoor Pashteen. The charismatic 26-year-old, rarely seen without his “Pashteen hat”, leads the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), which has convulsed the country with unprecedentedly virulent criticism of the powerful armed forces. It accuses the military of being behind a litany of abuses in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), an inhospitable, mountainous region on the border with Afghanistan dominated by Pakistan’s 15-million-strong Pashtun minority and which has played host to a variety of terrorist groups.Although Pashteen is committed to non-violent protest, his youthfulness, firebrand speeches and distinctive headgear have drawn comparisons with Che Guevara.What marks the PTM out as a particular threat to Pakistan’s army, which has ruled the country for more than half its 70-year history, is that its allegations mirror those made by western officials, namely that the army plays a “double game” with regard to terrorism, silently supporting groups that target India and Afghanistan.The government has responded with a crackdown, banning rallies and harassing PTM supporters. Nine PTM activists have gone missing in Karachi, Pakistan’s southern business capital. At a rally last weekend in Swat, pro-military protesters tried to block entry to some of a 25,000-strong crowd.Even the “Pashteen hat” has been subjected to local, unofficial bans. Replicas can no longer be found in the Swat valley city of Mingora, where at least five shopkeepers selling the hat were recently detained and beaten by thugs associated with the military, locals say.At a rally in Lahore on 21 April, held in defiance of the government ban, Pashteen bowed his head like a boxer as minders escorted him through an exultant, selfie-taking crowd to a stage adorned with pictures of missing people. Earlier that day, sewage had mysteriously flooded the ground. About 8,000 people – many in the Pashteen cap – chanted “the uniforms are behind the terrorists”, a slogan that fosters particular apoplexy in the military’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.Pashteen tells his audience that he has come to Lahore, a city populated by relatively few Pashtuns, to “expose what the army are doing against us”. To his right, a gigantic poster shows a devastated, rubble-strewn street in a town in North Waziristan partly flattened during a 2014 military campaign against Pakistan’s Taliban. That campaign is credited with helping reduce deaths from terrorism by more than two-thirds. Yet, according to the PTM, ordinary Pashtuns were caught in the crossfire, and have ever since been subject to humiliating curfews, checkpoints and collective punishment by troops stationed to maintain order.So-called enforced disappearances generate particular grief. A government commission has dealt with almost 5,000 cases since 2011, but rights groups say this number vastly underestimates the scale of the problem. “According to the constitution, anybody who commits a crime must be produced in a court of law within 24 hours,” says Pashteen. “But so many people have been taken and are still missing.” His voice rising, almost to a scream, Pashteen yells at the crowd “are you with the tyrants?” He calls on ordinary soldiers to defy the orders of high command, a statement some have interpreted as treasonous. One rally-goer from Pakistan’s Punjab majority bites his lip and glances anxiously over his shoulder. “It’s quite remarkable hearing this,” he says, on condition of anonymity. “What it portends for Pakistan I don’t know.”By tradition the military is largely referred to in code, as “the establishment” or, in the case of agents of the feared Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), “angels”. Among PTM-supporters, however, that is changing. “Before the PTM we didn’t say anything, even in our bedrooms, about the ISI and military intelligence,” says Shehrullah Khan, whose brother was “disappeared” from his luggage shop in 2016. With some safety in numbers, “we can now say everything in our mind and hearts”. PTM leaders admit that some of the disappeared may have links to the Taliban, but argue that all should be produced in court to face charges.A white flag, representing the movement’s commitment to non-violent protest, flutters above the stage. Among the stereotypes Pashteen is helping to break down, says analyst Fasi Zaka, is that of “Pashtuns being a martial ethnic group given to conflict”. Its leaders argue that Pashtuns are more victims of the Taliban than the willing hosts often portrayed in the media. One, Ali Wazir, has had 17 members of his family or killed.The military response betrays choking discomfort. General Bajwa, the chief of army staff, has referred indirectly to the PTM as being “engineered” by Pakistan’s enemies. Reporting on the movement has been censored in the media. Yet, unable to stop its growth, corps commander Lt General Nazir Ahmad Butt held a meeting last week with the PTM to discuss its “legitimate grievances”, referring to a five-point list of demands that includes de-mining, the punishment of a Karachi police chief accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, and a “truth and reconciliation commission” on enforced disappearances.“The PTM’s success,” says civil rights activist Jibran Nasir, is that after years of denial, some in the military “admit there have been some transgressions”.From the back seat of a car whisking him away from a horde of supporters, Pashteen tells the  that he is unconcerned by a possible threat to his life. “At first my family said they would throw me out of the house,” he says, “but now they say if you are killed, then at least you will have done something for the people.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e46a994bcdae3b8e7a29fc1dfaad98b8c0b7095/0_257_880_528/master/880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cd6be706e9cbaf942231a1b1758bf77","title":"toronto canada news car hang bridge","story":"Canadian police initially said the hollowed-out Honda Civic found dangling linked to a movie shoot. Now they don’t knowWas it the aftermath of a horrific accident? An art project? A prank?Police and passersby were left perplexed and concerned after a burned-out car was found dangling precariously from a Toronto bridge as traffic rumbled overhead.Soon after the blue sedan was spotted during rush-hour traffic on Wednesday, police, firefighters and paramedics showed up to assess the mysterious car. Strung up by a cable, it floated over a grassy area and posed no danger to public safety, officials said. City police at first said it was a prop for a movie shoot. But after speaking with city officials, they retracted this explanation. No movie shoot had been authorised, they said, and police were now investigating how exactly the car ended up suspended in mid-air. The hollowed-out Honda Civic appeared to be scrubbed of all identifying markers it bore no licence plate, several windows were missing and its underbelly had been stripped. “I just saw some of the pictures myself and I was mystified as to how the car ended up there,” Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, told reporters on Wednesday. “You’re always very puzzled as to how a car would have got into that particular situation.”Social media stirred with speculation. “What’s weirder: the fact that there’s a car dangling from a wire below a bridge, or that nobody has the slightest idea why or how the car got there in the first place?” wrote one person on Twitter. Another pointed to the confusion over whether the car was linked to a movie shoot, asking: “Are the cameras, cast and crew hiding? Did they finish filming and simply forget the dangling car?”A myriad of theories soon sprung up online to explain the car, linking it to everything from aliens to a student end-of-year prank – a nod to a 2001 prank that saw engineering students at the University of British Columbia suspend a red Volkswagen beetle – outfitted with a Canadian flag – from San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. Hours after the car in Toronto was spotted, the city’s fire department managed to safely lower it to the ground. Police said they were continuing to investigate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e323b11b6cd911ad5f58d04882473f9c54b1cc3/0_1133_6270_3760/master/6270.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b44d8037701d7b8944b76a6d1115e74e","title":"china deploys cruise missiles on south china sea outposts reports","story":"Missiles could targets ships and aircraft, according to CNBC, and mark another step in the militarisation of the disputed islandsChina has installed cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems on three of its outposts in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, according to reports.The US news network CNBC reported that the YJ-12B cruise missiles could target ships within a radius of 295 nautical miles and the HQ-9B long-range surface-to-air missiles could strike within 160 miles, citing sources with knowledge of US intelligence reports. The move, if confirmed, would mark the first Chinese missile deployments in the Spratly islands, where several Asian countries including Vietnam and Taiwan have rival claims. China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CNBC quoted unnamed sources as saying that according to US intelligence assessments, the missiles had been moved to Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef and Mischief Reef within the past 30 days. The US defence department, which opposes China’s installation of military facilities on outposts it has built up in the South China Sea, declined to comment. “We don’t comment on matters of intelligence,” a spokesman said.China has made no mention of any missile deployments but says its military facilities in the Spratlys are purely defensive, and that it can do what it likes on its own territory. Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, said deploying missiles on the outposts would be important. “These would be the first missiles in the Spratlys, either surface to air, or anti-ship,” he said. He added that such deployments were expected as China built missile shelters on the reefs last year and already deployed such missile systems on Woody Island further to the north. Poling said it would be another step on China’s road to dominating the South China Sea, a key global trade route. “Before this, if you were one of the other claimants ... you knew that China was monitoring your every move. Now you will know that you’re operating inside Chinese missile range. That’s a pretty strong, if implicit, threat,” he said. Last month, US Admiral Philip Davidson, nominated to head US Pacific command, said China’s “forward operating bases” in the South China Sea appeared complete. “The only thing lacking are the deployed forces,” he said. Once these were added, “China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania”.

It is about women’s health it’s about women’s lives,” said Leo Varadkar, as women wondered if there will ever come a day when the intimate details of their health and their lives are not dissected and debated and held up for public scrutiny by very important men.“This comes after a very difficult year with controversies around issues such as #MeToo, sexual harassments and difficult rape trials and other matters as well. And I know this country hasn’t always treated women very well, and in the past and even today perhaps, treats them very badly, whether it is mother and baby homes or Magdalen laundries or the marriage bar or the Hep C scandal.”As the contributions from TDs piled up, Leo’s initial list was expanded by other speakers.Of course, the catalogue of insults they reopened was an old one. These things don’t happen in these more enlightened times.Except they do.“Even tonight you’ve been put in the unenviable position of coming in here with new information, drip-feed, reclarifying the information,” said Daly. She accepted the cancer screening process is not wholly reliable. Mistakes happen no matter what systems are in place and tragedies happen and will continue to happen. How society responds is what matters.It was agreed by all sides the response by CervicalCheck and ultimately the HSE to the women whose cancer was not detected in their initial tests has been completely unacceptable.The situation is a mess. Women who have had cervical smears and were given the all-clear are now worrying their results may not have been correct. The Taoiseach made a point of stressing “there is nobody walking around today with a cervical cancer diagnosis from whom that information is being withheld by the HSE.”He was personally “very angry” that women were not told that following an audit of their tests it was discovered that pre-cancerous cells were not picked up when they had their first check. “I’m a Taoiseach, a doctor and also a brother with two sisters.”He mentioned his anger twice. “Not just angry, Taoiseach, you should be livid, livid about what’s after happening in these cases,” responded Joan Collins of Independents4Change.Meanwhile, Alan Kelly couldn’t believe his ears when Minister for Health Simon Harris imparted his new information. It was “a bombshell that you’re after landing in her tonight, which I wasn’t prepared for . . . This is a bombshell. What volume of women haven’t had their cases audited?”And he looked around the chamber, with its usual overpopulation of men in suits.“We actually have a big problem in this country protecting women’s health” he declared, adding that Vicky Phelan, the woman with terminal cancer whose diagnosis was missed and who had to take her fight to the High Court, was probably following the debate at home.“I’m sure she’s watching us all here tonight, fellas,” he said.Louise O’Reilly, Sinn Fein’s health spokeswoman, echoed remarks made during Leaders’ Questions by Mary Lou McDonald about the decision not to tell women that their first test for cancer should have come up as positive.“The toxic culture of concealment and harassment pursued by the HSE and Government against women who have been wronged by the State is now in full public view” she said, urging the Minister to ensure that other affected women are not forced to fight the State through the courts as Phelan and others have been made to do.The Fianna Fáil leader summed up the state of confusion surrounding the story. “Everybody knew but nobody knew, and nobody could tell us anything in the past week. It had to be dragged and drip fed in a frenzied way.”Mary Lou McDonald homed in on the presumption of medics who decide what a woman with terminal cancer needs to know.“They passed away not knowing that their cancer should have been caught earlier, that their treatment programmes, prognosis and possibly their outcomes could have been different. They died unaware that this information was known to the HSE and to others.” It was part of a “a toxic culture of concealment and a refusal to take responsibility within the HSE, a culture in which women are literally allowed to die before fault is admitted.”All day, the questions kept coming for the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health, underlining the sense of confusion and ignorance felt by people trying to fathom the detail of this scandal.It’s creating a sense of worry where there should be none.“Across Ireland today, there are many thousands of women terrified following the revelations about the CervicalCheck screening programme,” said Labour leader, Brendan Howlin. What’s to be done to reassure them?Mary Lou called for the resignation of the head of the HSE, Tony O’Brien.But the Taoiseach said the full facts have yet to emerge, but he is determined to get to the bottom of the issue. He asked for more time. “I think everyone, even Tony O’Brien, deserves a fair hearing.”Whatever we do, it should be based on facts. We are letting women down, and letting people’s health down, in particular, women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on facts.We are really letting people down, particularly the women of Ireland, with regard to women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on fact.Facts are already out there: the Taoiseach outlined some of them, others were added, such as symphysiotomy, maternal deaths, Brigid McCole, Susie Long . . .And in the chamber, there was the unspoken spectre of the referendum and the further fears of pregnant women who have cancer and how the State might treat them too.The wonderful women of Ireland, so beloved of all TDs in the Dáil.What they don’t know won’t hurt them.What you don’t know won’t hurt us.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481694.1525280557!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"karl marx s insights retain their clout and relevance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA statue of German philosopher, economist, political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx is placed on its plinth in his birthplace of Trier, Germany. Photograph: Harald TittelAFPGetty His view over Brussels’s magnificent Grand Place from La Maison du Cygne was a vivid architectural representation of what he was trying to write. History as class struggle.The tall gothic and baroque guild houses, an expression of the rise to pre-eminence of the merchant bourgeoisie, and the town hall spoke of municipal power and wealth. And surrounded by a city teeming with the poor and hungry . . .An impoverished Karl Marx, barely 30, spent three years here from 1846.And in the back room of what is now one of Brussels’ most chic restaurants, with friend Friedrich Engels, he laboured over their most important work, The Manifesto of the Communist Party, part-groundbreaking philosophical and historical thesis, but above all a call to action that would reverberate around the world.Two hundred years ago next Saturday, Marx was born in the small German town of Trier, where EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will deliver a speech for the birthday unveiling of a 5.5m statue of the local boy, a gift from the People’s Republic of China.“Nobody can deny that Karl Marx is a figure who shaped history in one way or the other,” a commission spokeswoman defensively insisted. “Not speaking about him would come close to denying history.”His intellectual legacy is everywhere. Last week with a laugh, a senior Irish diplomat described to me the “mao dung” – Chinese for “internal contradiction” – at the heart of a commission proposal. Doomed, he was suggesting, like capitalism and its contradictions, to the dustbin of history.Neither Juncker nor my diplomat, you may be relieved to hear, are closet Marxists, but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 , they, like many others, economists, historians and philosophers, have been willing to look again seriously at the ideas of a man at whose door most of the 20th century’s woes have been unfairly laid by conventional opinion.And yet. No more than the bloody crusades, or the terreur and the guillotine can be said definitively to characterise Christendom or the French Republic,\u0026nbsp Marx too can and must be rescued from his disciples’ excesses and intellectual rigidities. “If anything is certain,” he would claim to “revolutionary phrase-mongering” adherents, “it is that I myself am not a Marxist.”Rescuing Marx is first and foremost about rescuing his thinking from the charge – a caricature – of dogmatism and rigidity. On the contrary, it is above all a methodology of thinking and analysis, not a fixed position, not a political programme, nor a set of explicit prescriptions for the world’s ills.One that explores the dynamics of constant change in the economic, political and ideological spheres as the working-out of contradictions. In Marx’s view, these are the tensions between old ways of creating the means of survival, and their social organisation, and new, emerging forms of economic and political organisation. Irreconcilable opposites in whose synthesis the new world is created.But for Marx, and his “historical materialism”, history itself was inherently open-ended: “All history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.”“In Marx’s vision, which cannot recognise anything as absolutely final,” the late philosopher István Mészáros wrote, “there can be no place for a utopian golden age, neither ‘round the corner’ nor astronomical distances away. Such a golden age would be an end of history, and thus the end of man himself.”It was not Marxists who announced “the end of history” on the fall of the Soviet Union, supposedly the triumph of capitalism as the highest and unsurpassable civilisation. Such finality is absurd to them.Marx’s analysis and insights have made much of modern sociology and shaped political and historical theory. Gender theory, race theory, and new insights into humanity’s ecological death wish, have all added to and deepened his insights into the exploitation that drives capitalismEven right-wing economists nod at his critique of the market. The jury may still be out on whether, as he predicts, there is an inevitable tendency for the rate of profit to fall.But, most recently, in a powerful dissection of the data on wealth concentrations and distribution over the last 250 years, French economist Thomas Piketty convincingly linked growing global inequality to the fact that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth. In other words, as Marx predicted, under capitalism the rich will get richer and the poor, poorer .“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point is to change it,” Marx wrote in 1845. And the view of the cobbled square from the Maison du Cygne remains. Unchanged."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481967.1525291648!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish border centre stage at westminster and in eu negotiations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid Trimble was one of a number of speakers in the House of Lords who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Peter MorrisonAP PhotoWednesday’s debate in the House of Lords about Brexit and the Border was an elegant affair, with Chris Patten and Northern Ireland minister Ian Duncan quoting lines from Louis MacNeice to one another and peers displaying elaborate courtesy as they argued. The debate underscored the central position the Border now occupies in the Brexit negotiations, and in Theresa May’s efforts to agree a common position with her ministers on future customs arrangements.The debate also exposed, however, the rawness which has entered into the atmosphere between London and Dublin and between unionist politicians and their counterparts in Dublin.Patten poked fun at Brexiteers who blamed Dublin for the impasse over the Border, and at David Davis’s theory about who was pulling Leo Varadkar’s strings.“The secretary of state for exiting the European Union said that the problem was because the leader of the Fine Gael party, the Taoiseach, was in the pocket of Sinn Féin. Sinn Féin and Fine Gael – I think the secretary of state must have been away the day they did Irish history at school,” he said.But former Alliance leader John Alderdice said the idea of a coalition between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin was not such a fanciful one and historian Paul Bew agreed, pointing to an email exchange between the Taoiseach’s office and Sinn Féin “showing an intimacy of spirit which nobody would have believed possible from a Fine Gael government”.David Trimble was one of a number of speakers who complained that Dublin and Brussels were engaging with only one community in Northern Ireland, suggesting that making deals over the heads of the people was a greater threat to peace than Brexit.“If future arrangements are to be made over the Northern Ireland Border it is obvious that you have to have the people of Northern Ireland and their elected representatives closely involved in that. If not, you are going to make the same mistake,” he said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481907.1525286901!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may postpones customs decision after ministers disagree","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg denied that Brexiteers had given Theresa May an ultimatum on customs arrangements with EU. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireTheresa May has postponed a decision on Britain’s future customs relationship with the European Union, asking officials to draw up revised proposals after her senior ministers failed to agree a common approach. The cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee met on Wednesday after Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers called on the prime minister to abandon one of her two customs proposals.Reports after the meeting suggested that Ms May’s new home secretary, Sajid Javid, and defence secretary Gavin Williamson joined Brexiteer ministers to oppose the proposed “customs partnership”, which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU. Ministers opposed to a hard Brexit, including chancellor Philip Hammond and business secretary Greg Clark, spoke in favour of it.The European Research Group (ERG) of 60 MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the customs partnership as unworkable and urged the government to focus exclusively on a second option of a customs arrangement known as Maximum Facilitation or MaxFac, which would use technological and administrative measures to make customs controls less intrusive.Mr Rees-Mogg denied that the group was threatening to move against the prime minister unless she took the customs partnership off the table.“There is no question of there being an ultimatum. This is a paper that has been produced on a specific aspect of policy that would not work, that would not effectively take us out of the European Union. It would leave us de facto in both the customs union and the single market,” he told the BBCHousing minister Dominic Raab, who campaigned for Brexit, said\u0026nbspthose opposed to the customs partnership option appeared to be winning the argument.“I always keep an open mind on this because I do think when it comes to Brexit we are going to be forging a distinct path, the UK, not taking some off-the-shelf model. But I suspect actually in terms of delivering the two things that we need, which is to stay out of the customs union but also avoid the hard border as a matter of principle but also workability, at the moment the way I read it is that those in favour of max fac are winning the argument,” he said.At prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Ms May said there were “a number of ways” to deliver frictionless trade and avoid a hard Border in Ireland, fuelling speculation that the government is looking at a third option in an effort to unite the cabinet. Asked about the prime minister’s remarks, her spokesman said the government’s ideas on the customs relationship were evolving.“Work has been ongoing on two options that work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along the prime minister said there’s a number of options of ways to proceed,” he said.Labour’s Stephen Doughty, who supports a campaign for a second referendum on leaving the EU, said the government was negotiating with itself about customs options Brussels has already rejected, and the government’s negotiation with itself was going about as well as its negotiations with the EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“With less than six months to go before the final Brexit deal is supposed to be agreed, Ministers are still fighting among themselves about which of their two discredited customs proposals to persist with. Our European negotiating partners, who have for good reason already dismissed both proposals as unworkable, must be baffled as to what on earth the government wants,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

These include introducing automatic compensation for slow repairs, missed appointments and delayed installations from March 2019.It will also strengthen the rules on complaints handling to ensure that providers deal with complaints from consumers promptly and effectively from October.Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom’s consumer group director, said: “People are doing more with their internet now, and expect more of their providers.Some companies are keeping up with their customers’ needs, but others clearly aren’t. We’re encouraging people to look beyond price and vote with their feet if they’re not happy with their service.People often focus on price when they’re choosing a phone or broadband provider.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Although they had wings, their skulls more closely resembled those of dinosaurs.Ichthyornis, unlike Archaeopteryx, is thought to have been a strong flier. Its streamlined body was simplified and adapted for flight like modern birds.“Despite the modernity of its body and wings, it retained almost a full complement of dinosaurian teeth, and it had a strong bite with large, dinosaurian jaw muscles,” said Mr Bhullar. “However, it perceived its world and thought like a bird, with a bird’s enormous eyes and expanded, modern-looking brain.”While primitive birds such as Confuciusornis, which lived 125 million years ago, had beaks, the small one sported by Ichthyornis is the first known to have modern attributes like a “pincer tip” for grasping, pecking and fine manipulation.“Its sharp teeth probably would have assisted in holding onto slippery marine prey, while the incipient beak at the tips of its jaws probably would have allowed it to manipulate objects with fine dexterity such as modern birds can do, and preen its feathers,” said University of Bath paleontologist Daniel Field.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Ichthyornis had a two-foot wing and probably ate fish and shellfish. It shared the skies with flying reptiles called pterosaurs at a time when dinosaurs dominated the land.Toothed birds vanished along with the dinosaurs and many other species after an asteroid impact 66 million years ago.Ichthyornis fossils were first written about by Yale paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in the 19th century and were later cited by Darwin as strong support for his theory of evolution.The Yale and Bath researchers used CT scans to analyse the newly discovered specimens. Their study is published in the journal Nature.“The fossil record provides our only direct evidence of the evolutionary transformations that have given rise to modern forms,” said Mr Field. “This extraordinary new specimen reveals the surprisingly late retention of dinosaur-like features in the skull of Ichthyornis - one of the closest-known relatives of modern birds from the Age of Reptiles.”University of Bathor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Unlike animals, plants do not have nervous systems and so cannot communicate using rapid electrical signals.Instead, their signalling both within their bodies and with neighbours consists of the relatively slow exchange of chemical messages.Some of this communication takes place via strands of underground fungi that plants use to share food, warning signals and even toxic chemicals – a phenomenon that some biologists have informally termed the “wood-wide web”.In the study by Dr Ninkovic and his colleagues, they wanted to investigate whether chemicals released directly into the soil by stressed plants could change the behaviour of their neighbours.Five plants and animals utterly confused by climate changeThe researchers began by applying a soft brush to corn seedlings, a touch that could represent any number of nearby stresses, including new plants encroaching on their territory or a plant-eating animal nibbling on their leaves.New seedlings were then transferred into the same growing material as the recently touched plants to see if their growth was affected – the theory being that plants touched by the brush would have left chemical traces in the soil documenting their experience.The scientists found that the fresh seedlings responded by growing more leaves and fewer roots than plants that had grown under normal conditions.They suggested that the corn seedlings, upon being exposed to the chemical signals of recently touched plants in the soil, were responding by preparing themselves for the trouble ahead posed by new neighbours or becoming something’s dinner.While they seem largely defenceless against outside attack, plants actually wield a variety of defensive strategies when targeted by hungry herbivores. Previous research has demonstrated that plants respond defensively to the sounds that caterpillars make when munching on their leaves – flooding them with unappetising mustard oil.Engineers have figured out a way to make plants glowTo confirm that their plants were capable of telling the difference between soil occupied by touched and untouched plants, the scientists gave some corn seedlings a choice about which medium they preferred to grow in.When placed near both, roots grew preferentially towards the growing solution that had previously contained untouched plants.These findings were published in the scientific journal PLOS One.The team suggested their results should be noted by other scientists when conducting experiments with plants, as even gently brushing a plant’s leaves has the potential to change how it and its neighbours behave.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove also oppose itWith the overall balance of the cabinet six to five against the proposal, one source said Brexiteers now believe they have “killed” the option.Peers defeat government on plan for Irish border after BrexitUK police use EU system that may be lost post-Brexit 539m times a yearThe best Brexit deal does involve leaving the customs unionThis is why you should care about the local electionsAre countries really ‘queuing up for trade deals’ with Brexit UK?May ‘held hostage by extreme Brexiteers’ as customs decisions delayedBut in a sign that Ms May is not ready to let go of it, the prime minister asked for more work to be done on both of her existing proposals.The partnership plan would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf at ports and airports, passing on a share of the money to Brussels – then if the UK sets different tariffs from the EU, traders would claim refunds from HMRC for goods that stay in Britain.Olly Robbins, Ms May’s Europe adviser, regards the partnership as a means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, while keeping the UK out of the European customs union. Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.Boris Johnson: Northern Irish border being used to try and keep the UK in the customs unionThe group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous”, “deeply unsatisfactory” and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or even “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

First of all, there isn’t a lot of evidence that signing new free trade agreements (FTAs) would deliver an economic boost anything like enough to compensate for the hit from leaving the EU single market and customs union. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says “simple arithmetic” and “a basic understanding of trade” show the gains from such FTAs are likely to be small.But another problem is that countries aren’t exactly queuing up to do deals with Britain – or where they seem to be, things aren’t as straightforward as they appear.The US president has been enthusiastic about a trade deal (AP)Donald Trump has said he wants a “big and exciting” trade deal with the UK, which sounds promising. In reality, however, the price of such a trade deal could be so high as to be unworkable. A previous US-EU attempt at a trade deal, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, failed after Mr Trump suspended negotiations because it wasn’t favourable enough to the US. But on this side of the Atlantic, even that deal was equally controversial because of US stipulations on scaling back welfare and hygiene rules for farm animals, as well as opening up public services like the NHS to US private corporations.With polling showing the public firmly against US foodstuff such as chlorinated chicken coming to Britain, any deal likely to be acceptable to Mr Trump would be sure to contain extremely unpopular and controversial elements – particularly if it were to be negotiated at speed.The UK has a huge trade deficit with China, the workshop of the world (Reuters)China’s approach to post-Brexit trade has been cautious, despite multiple visits from senior British politicians to pay their respects and drum up support.The country’s envoy to the EU, Zhang Ming, has specifically said that China would not open trade negotiations with Britain if the UK did not manage to conclude a withdrawal agreement with the EU – which some Brexiteers are pushing for.President Xi Jinping called for a “golden era” of relations before Britain voted to leave the EU, but enthusiasm has been less obvious since the referendum. Following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK, warned Chinese firms operating in the UK they should now take “precautions” – widely interpreted as coded support for the defeated Remain campaign. Japanese car firms have invested heavily in the UK in recent decades (AFPGetty)Japan has been among the most vocally negative about Brexit and explicitly said it would prioritise the EU for trade deals over Britain.The country, which reportedly sees Brexit as an act of “self-harm”, said doing a deal with the EU – which would now not apply to Britain – would be “first and foremost a priority” over negotiating anything with the UK, according to its diplomatic minister.Japanese companies are particularly concerned about the UK’s exit from the single market and customs union, which is seen as important for industries like carmaking, which rely on frictionless trade set to come to an end under current government plans.Businesspeople from the country who met with Theresa May earlier this year told her openly that they would leave the UK if they could no longer make a profit under the new arrangement.Trudeau with May in Ottawa (AFPGetty)Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he wants a “seamless” trade deal with the UK – aiming to “flip over” a new agreement between Canada and the EU so that it still applies to Britain.This sounds positive, but there are three significant things to bear in mind. The first is that even if this goes well, there would be no gain for Britain – it would merely be replicating an existing trade deal that the UK already benefits from as an EU member.The second is that it may not be as simple as it sounds: little progress has been reported so far on issues such as what share of the EU’s quotas belongs to Britain. The third is that Canada is not a huge economy, equal to one of the larger 28 EU member states – its GDP sits roughly between Italy and Spain. British objections to sky high tariffs on Scotch whisky held back an EU-India trade deal (Getty)Yashvardhan Sinha, India’s high commissioner to Britain, has specifically said the country is not in a “rush” to do a trade deal with Britain after Brexit. India, whose economy is set to overtake Britain’s in size over the next few years, has been in trade talks with the EU for a trade deal since 2007.In fact, the country does see Brexit as an opportunity to do a deal – with the EU. Britain has been holding up a trade deal between India and the EU by opposing the more liberal immigration and visa regime sought by the South Asian country’s government. Another sticking point is the sky high tariffs on Scotch whisky imposed by India, which Britain would not accept as part of a deal.Despite a series of limited commercial agreement already inked between the two countries, both these obstacles would remain to a full UK-India deal after Brexit – indeed, Delhi has specifically said it wants visa liberalisation as a condition.British beef producers could face competition (Jo Turner)Mercosur is a South American trade bloc that includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – which must be dealt with collectively for trade deal purposes because they’re in a customs union together.Brazil and Argentina have both expressed an enthusiastic interest in doing a possible deal with Britain – with the most notable outcome a flood of cheap South American beef into UK markets. That means lower prices for British consumers, though potentially difficult times ahead for this country’s beef producers.The South American bloc is already negotiating a separate trade deal with the EU, having relaunched stalled negotiations in May 2016 as the UK voted for Brexit. A trade deal with Britain might be more simple to conclude than one with the EU, however, because the UK has fewer and weaker agricultural interests than most European countries. The EU’s new trade deal with Mexico includes agricultural produce between the two blocs (Reuters)The European Union and Mexico reached an agreement on a trade deal in April of this year, getting rid of practically all tariffs. The deal is currently being finalised into a legal text. Trade secretary Liam Fox has said he wants to roll over this EU trade deal to keep its benefits after Brexit – but as with Canada’s EU deal, the process might not be straightforward, and there has been little reported progress so far.South Korea already has a trade deal with the EU (Alamy)South Korea is in a similar situation to Canada: the EU has a trade deal with the East Asian country already, and Britain wants to roll it over once it leaves to keep the benefits. As with the other countries in a similar situation, this will not be straightforward – but British business have notably raised concerns that South Korea in particular will ask for concessions and favourable terms from the UK to keep continuity. The Department for International Trade says it has “already held discussions with more than 70 countries” and insists “none have displayed any interest in disrupting trade flows, or in erecting barriers to trade that do not currently exist” – but trade experts are concerned that countries will use the UK’s situation to try to extract favourable terms.May gladhands Turnbull at Downing Street (Getty)Australia has been perhaps the most positive about a trade deal with the UK after Brexit. The country’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was “very keen” to do a deal with the UK “as quickly as possible”, in a joint press conference with Theresa May last year. Australia is, however, a relatively small player on the world stage, with an economy well out of the top 10 and roughly the size of Spain.Australia is also already negotiating a free trade deal with the EU, having opened preparatory talks with the bloc years ago – so Britain may not actually gain any new advantage from negotiating a separate agreement.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Stephen Hawking fed the poor in final act of kindness                Stephen Hawking given new \u0026lsquovoice\u0026rsquo to say final goodbye to familyThey claim we inhabit just one of these pocket universes in a region where inflation has ended.But Prof Hawing was always sceptical about the idea, claiming it could not be reconciled with Einstein\u0027s theory of General Relativity.Instead, his new theory embraces the strange concept that the universe is like a vast and complex hologram - and 3D reality is an illusion.The apparently solid world around us and the dimension of time are projected from information stored on a flat 2D surface.Stephen Hawking died in MarchAnd put together with Belgian colleague Professor Thomas Hertog, his variation of the holography theory overcomes the problem of combining eternal expansion of the universe with General Relativity.Prof Hertog, from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KT Leuven), said the concept of a holographic universe emerged from string theory, the idea that the smallest building blocks of the universe consist of tiny vibrating strings.He said: It\u0027s a very precise mathematical notion of holography that has come out of string theory in the last few years which is not fully understood but is mind-boggling and changes the scene completely.Applied to inflation, the newly published theory suggests that time and the beginning of the universe arose holographically from an unknowable state outside the Big Bang.He said: The key point is that we\u0027re not projecting out a spatial dimension. We are projecting out the dimension of time from \u0027before\u0027 the Big Bang.The theory challenges ideas about the multiverseIt\u0027s a theory that envisages a beginning to the universe where time is not present but our notion of time crystallises.And it\u0027s saying that time is fundamentally coming out of some other state for which we have no words.Some very abstract timeless state - that\u0027s the best we can do.The theory does not completely do away with the multiverse but no longer envisages an infinite fractal structure.Prof Hawking said before his death: We are not down to a single, unique universe, but our findings imply a significant reduction of the multiverse, to a much smaller range of possible universes.Prof Hertog believes gravitational waves - ripples in space time first detected in 2015 - could provide a smoking gun to test the model."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-uk-labour-party-954331.jpg","title":"Brexit news UK EU BBC Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn European Union customs union","story":"Andrew Neil snapped at Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds claiming the European Union would never accept Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos Brexit policy.Labour Party has said that they would fight to keep the UK in a customs union if it was negotiating Britain\u0026rsquos exit from the EU.BBC Daily Politics host Andrew Neil pointed out the EU would not allow the UK to strike its own trade deals if they remained in \u0026lsquoa customs union\u0026rsquo.He said: \u0026ldquoSurely you have to admit that you can not do your own free trade agreements?BBCBrexit news: Andrew Neil and Nick Thomas-Symonds clashed in a heated row over Labour\u0027s Brexit policyMr Thomas-Symonds replied: \u0026ldquoSurely you would accept Andrew that depends exactly how you negotiate the position.The host then picked about the Labour MP\u0026rsquos argument, claiming the EU\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator would never accept that proposal.Neil said: \u0026ldquoHold on, Michel Barnier has said that he does not want the technical blue skies thinking approach, he says it is just pie in the sky.

including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.He has said he does not want to be PM but is favourite to take over in a poll of Tory members by the website ConservativeHome.Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as the favourite among most bookies as the nations likely next PM.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected 2017 general election when Labour picked up 30 seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win. Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments. At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Brexit Secretary David Davis has a prominent role leading Britains Brexit negotiations in Brussels.Last July a study found more than a fifth of Conservatives wanted him to take as PM.But the latest polls of party members shows his support has slipped behind potential rivals.Mr Davis previously stood for the party leadership in 2001 and 2005 coming fourth and second respectively.His working-class roots also distance him from the view of Tories as out-of-touch toffs.But he has also been accused of being thick and lazy and there were calls for him to be held in contempt of Parliament over non-existent impact papers.   Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They told her that I was wanted by the Home Office for deportation.“She told me that she had to suspend me because they had told her that that they could be prosecuted and fined if they kept me on the books.”It then took him several days to get through to the Home Office - leaving him unable to work during that time.He said that when he got through: “I explained the situation.I was hysterical. I told him that the idea of me being deported to Uganda was ridiculous.“I was passed on to a manager who said that they had no idea how or why it had happened.”Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary on Sunday night in the wake of the Windrush generation crisis.Today it was claimed that up to 7,000 foreign students may have been wrongly accused of cheating and kicked out of Britain.A spokesman for the Home Office said: “Mr Herbert was sent a letter in May 2015 incorrectly warning that he was the subject of enforcement action.“When the mistake was identified in October 2015, we wrote to Mr Herbert to acknowledge the error and apologise.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nintchdbpict0003294979392.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"weird wacky small parties local elections 2018","story":"Thousands of council seats are up for grabs on Thursday, with Labour set to make gains in the capital, and the Tories elsewhere in the leafy suburbs.And while Jeremy Corbyns anti-Semitism problems could cost him dearly, Theresa Mays just lost her close ally the Home Secretary Amber Rudd and is in a fight with her Brexiteer MPs over the Customs Union.Theres all to play for as the polls open at 7am tomorrow morning.But if youre growing tired of red vs blue, and dont fancy the yellows or greens either, dont worry.Theres plenty of other weird, wonderful and wacky parties to put your cross next to - if thats what takes your fancy. Yes, they are still going - but unfortunately with six candidates across the UK.Known for their huge rossettes, mad outfits and nutty nature, the Loonys have been a feature of British politics for years.Previous policies have included raising cash for the police by selling castles to the French, getting tax payers to receive Nectar points from HMRC and banning all leeks from the Welsh Assembly canteen.Upon the election of Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 they came up with a bright new policy - handing him over to the Argentinians.But just a few months later the joke party accused him of stealing THEIR policies, when Jez announced plans for an extra bank holiday. The man who once challenged Nigel Farage to a duel, Polish Prince John Zylinski, has set up his own party.The property tycoon, who also has a taste for ballet dancing, said he wanted to give the Polish community in Britain a voice.Party policies included calling for a new criminal offence for hate crimes to do with Brexit, and a memorial in Hyde Park to honour Polish pilots in World War II. These guys say their mighty shire has been left behind by Westminster and want to go it alone and become a devolved state.They promise a Yorkshire Parliament to speak up for their own area, and will promote the areass businesses on the world stage. The party was only forged in January this year but is already putting up candidates this week.It was created by two-time Ukip leadership candidate John Rees Evans, who is most famous for once claiming that a gay donkey raped his horse.The partys logo even features a donkey too. The party claims it is the the first time a radical, Marxist-Leninist working class organisation has stood in elections of any form in many years - and if thats not reason to break out your little pencil, we dont know what is.They call society a dictatorship is an evil which must be overthrown, and the workers must become masters of British society.Snubbing other socialist parties, they claim to apply Marxist science to all of their work, and they are not scared to tell it how it is.You can probably can only vote for them in Birmingham, however. Shame. New anti-Brexit party Renew officially kicked off in February, but the official launch turned out to be a total flop.Inspired by French President Emmanuel Macron, who swept to victory with his movement En Marche! in 2017, the new grouping wants to convince MPs to vote down Theresa Mays Brexit deal.Just a handful of people showed up though - even though they claimed to be able to field around 200 candidates for this weeks vote.And to make matters worse, one of the three leaders walked out part-way through the press conference - reportedly to do a media interview.The party opposes Brexit and will fight to reverse it. Founded in 1999 they campaign against same sex marriage and abortion - as part of trying to live by the followings of Jesus.Leader Sidney Cordle hit the headlines back in 2014 when he suggested that storms in the UK could have been caused by Gods anger to gay marriage.But they did campaign in 2015 for all married couples to get a £10,000 grant when they tied the knot. And dont forget there are many hundreds of independent candidates running across Britain, free of any political allegiances whatsoever.Not bound by party politics or in-fighting, independents can vote how they want.But its harder to get things done in council unless you can work with other people, as party folk will always stick together.The 2018 local elections are taking place on Thursday May 3 - polls open at 7am and close at 10pm, although if there’s a queue at the polling station you can still vote after 10 as long as you arrived before the deadline.Around 150 councils are holding elections, with a total of 4,370 seats up for grabs.Most of the local elections are focused in urban areas - Greater London, Greater Manchester, the Newcastle area, the Leeds region, and the West Midlands.A number of smaller cities and towns such as Cambridge, Hull, Milton Keynes, Oxford, Plymouth, Reading and Southampton are also holding council elections.And directly elected mayors will be chosen in four London boroughs and Watford.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks.It is like slavery, holocaust. Holocaust, is Jews, and slavery is blacks. So prison is something that unites us as one race.Black and whites, one race.

Without it, many people across the UK will continue to pay with their health.A Defra spokesman said: While air quality in the UK has improved significantly since 2010, this report from the WHO clearly shows the impact air pollution is having on the health of men, women and children in the UK and across the world.Tackling this important issue is a priority for this government which is why we have a £3.5billion plan to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions and will set out further actions through a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy later this year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402006274-e1525261203880.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fbi russia defectors uk live vladimir putin assassinations us","story":"Its understood they are instead being told to seek political asylum in the US, where Putin is too scared to carry out political assassinations.A history of suspected Russian assassinations on British soil dates back to at least 2003, suggesting Putin is comfortable killing at will in the UK.Although the latest attempted assassination on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia has sparked a diplomatic row, it remains to be seen if this will prevent further attacks.Clive Stafford-Smith, one of Britains leading human rights lawyers, dubbed Prime Minister Theresa May and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson paper tigers.He told The Sun Online: I talked to a series of Russian opponents to Putin, who said all sorts of things, one of which was the FBI had been really friendly and there was some threat to the US but not much because he wouldnt dare do it here, but dont go to the UK because he was doing it really regularly there.I think in large part Theresa May when she was Home Secretary, and now as Prime Minister, she was loathe to take on Putin, because she was scared of him.One such dissenter - currently living in the US under FBI protection - told The Sun Online that he applied for political asylum in the US because it was the safest place for the Russian oppositionist.The defector, who has not been named due to fears for his safety, added: In the US, I feel much safer than in Europe.

We have had no paperwork on this.What followed was a public appeal for information about Eunice and the mysterious grave amid fears that the police would have to exhume the site.Rev Walters said this week: No one can of course legally place any form of memorial or decorated grave space in a graveyard or cemetery without permission.Unless someone steps forward to claim responsibility soon then we may have to refer the matter to the police for investigation and these items will be removed.But now, thanks to our investigation, Eunices family have come forward to reveal all about their cherished late mother and her desire to be interred at her mothers side.Eunice was born the youngest of eight children to Wilfred and Lavinia Birch in January 1928.Tragic mum Lavinia passed away just the following year, leaving agricultural worker Wilfred — who only had one arm after a mill accident aged 17 — to bring up the children.Eunice left school at 14, and after her father remarried the following year she moved in with her brother and then her sister until her marriage.She met husband Col Eric Hall when he was an airman stationed in Lincolnshire and she served in the NAAFI as a caterer.They would go on to have five children who were raised in Darlington, Co Durham — but absent Eric left much of the parenting duties to doting Eunice.Her son Jon, 68, says she would often talk about her own mother, whose distant but glowing memory she appeared to treasure dearly.Speaking from his home in Torquay, Devon, he told The Sun Online: She talked about Lavinia all the time, even thought she had very little recollection of her.All she had was two photographs of her mother. But it was her wish for as long as I can remember that when she died she would be placed with her mum.It meant that when she died in Torquay, where she had lived for 16 years to be closer to her children, the family felt obliged to bury her ashes nearly 300 miles away back in Lincolnshire.Children Alan, a policeman, stage manager Jon, retired headteacher Sandie and her twin Julie, who has since passed away, held a quiet but heartfelt burial ceremony with the previous vicar at St Margaret’s Church in May 2011, a month after Eunice’s death.But they are baffled that no records exist — because they claim they spent days in conversation with the church to organise their tributes.Sandie said: “I don’t know why the current vicar was so confused. We liaised for weeks with the previous vicar and his secretary to make sure we got everything absolutely right.“We asked to put up a plaque but we were told we had to get the right stone, with the right lettering, to comply with regulations”.The children would visit the grave as often as they could but eventually last October it was in need of freshening up.Jon said: Sandie went straight round to B\u0026ampQ and bought some green kerbstones and some lovely gravel. She bought some plants and shrubs and made the grave look lovely again.And that’s where I think the confusion with the current vicar came from.It was just a loving family who was very proud of their mum, to make sure everything looked perfect.Maybe we should have asked permission to tidy up the grave again, but we had already asked permission six years earlier, and thought that was enough.Our mum never knew her own mum and that was a source of great sadness to her. But now they are together again – and probably having a little chuckle.The Sun Online has reached out to Rev Walters to comment but he was not available."},{"url":null,"title":"man hid girlfriends corpse 15 months andrew colin reade refuses reveal","story":"Andrew Colin Reade was arrested on suspicion of murdering mum-of-three Vicky Cherry but never convicted.Police discovered Vickys body hidden under bike parts in the flat the couple shared in a Bolton cul-de-sac.Reade claimed he’d woken up to find Vicky dead, saying they’d taken a cocktail of illicit drugs together the night before.He said he’d panicked, and told police he wrapped the 44-year-old’s dead body in a duvet and plastic sheeting before shoving it in a cupboard.Over the next 15 months he told friends Vicky had left him and moved out.Neighbours told an inquest how Reade used air freshener to cover up the growing stench.Last June, Reade was jailed for four years and four months after admitting to preventing a lawful burial and perverting justice.But the cause of Cherry’s death remains unknown, with Reade refusing to attend the inquest last November.Vicky’s best friend, her cousin Donna Gregory, has now spoken out for the first time about her devastating loss.The mum-of-five said: “I was the last known person to speak to Vicky before her death. I carried her coffin at her funeral but we were told there was very little left of her.It was sickening.“It infuriates me that Reed has got off so lightly.”Donna, who now lives in Bradford, said she looked up to Vicky and idolised her as children. They were inseparable growing up.She said: “As we got older, we’d go out together and we became such good friends.“Vicky had a very troubled up-bringing and she had her problems. But she had a heart of gold.”Donna, from Preston, added that Vicky had struggled after her husband Steve’s death from an epileptic fit in 2013 – and met Andrew a year later.She said: “She confided in me that they were arguing a lot and I was worried about her.“She said he wasn’t treating her very well. She was quite vulnerable and I wish now, looking back, I had done more to try to talk her into leaving him, there and then.”One week before she went missing, in October 2015, Vicky called Donna and asked if she could go and live with her.“I blame myself, because she was supposed to come and live with me she was days away from a new start. Maybe I could have saved her.”Donna was the last person to speak to her and the last known person to have any contact with her.She said: “Vicky told me she’d had enough of Andrew. We made plans for her to come and live with me. I was looking forward to it, and I knew she’d be much happier if she was single again.”Donna then didn’t hear from Vicky for a fortnight – and became increasingly worried about her whereabouts.“I began to worry I asked around and nobody knew where she was. I called the police but they didn’t seem to take it seriously they went to the house but couldn’t find her.”Police eventually launched an appeal but the case seemed to make no progress.Donna says: “Vicky had vanished into thin air. We couldn’t work it out. I was so worried about her as time went on, I knew she had to be dead. It was the only explanation.”In January 2017, Vicky’s body was found in a cupboard at her home and Reade was arrested on suspicion of murder.Donna says: “I was preparing myself that she was dead. But I could never have been prepared for what had happened to her.In June last year, Andrew Colin Reade, 43, pleaded guilty to concealing the body of Victoria Cherry for 15 months and preventing her burial.The cause of death could not be ascertained because it had decomposed, but a pathologist concluded she may have died as a result of strangulation as injuries to her neck were detected.Reade admitted intending to pervert the course of justice by giving misleading and inaccurate information about the whereabouts of Victoria Cherry to police officers, pharmacists, and family members.The sicko also cashed in £1,000 of employment benefits sent to Vicky in the three months after her death."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000401239622.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ebay russia world cup 2018 completed panini sticker books","story":"The offers represent a bargain considering a professor recently calculated that filling the much-loved book by buying packets of stickers from shops and not doing swaps with pals would cost as much as £773.The price could be reduced to £250 if duplicates are swapped with 10 friends.However full books are now listed on the auction site for between £50 and £150.The Italian sticker giant also sells some individual stickers online for around 22p each.Dozens of books are available for sale on eBay – some with the stickers loose so at least buyers could experience the enjoyment of placing the players into the album themselves.Others already had the 682 labels already in place.A maths prof from Cardiff calculated that filling this year’s sticker book will cost collectors £773.60.Prof Paul Harper devised a formula that suggested, given the probabilities of getting duplicate stickers, on average an individual would need to buy 967 packets or 4,832 stickers to get the set.As well as pictures of the 32 squads of players competing in Russia this summer, there are special stickers for national badges, team group shots and host city posters, making a total of 682 stickers needed to fill the book.He said 137 packets of stickers costing £109.60 would be enough to complete the collection, providing you didn’t get any doubles.But that is an unlikely scenario.Many collectors of the sticker book have been critical of the price rise in this year’s stickers. Packets of five stickers are on sale for 80p, an increase on the 50p charged for the previous World Cup and Euro 2016 collections.Harper’s figures suggest the price rise has nearly doubled the cost of completing the collection compared with the Euro 2016 book two years ago.Harper told the BBC: “Filling an album has become progressively more expensive over the years since then, not just because there are typically more teams competing now, but because Panini has become more creative about allocating spaces.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000402620631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"young lefties reveal they cant stand corbyn any more and have abandoned labour ahead of local elections","story":"The 35-year-old FGM campaigner stood as a candidate for the Womens Equality Party last year, knowing she wouldnt win but keen to promote the feminist cause.But Labour activists told her in public that she shouldnt be taking part at all - hinting that as a black woman and an immigrant, its disloyal for her to challenge Labour.That was the final straw, Nimco told The Sun this week. The disdain they had for me, and the ownership of me because I’m black and a woman and a Muslim.She is one of many young people who are defying the Corbynista trend - saying the leftie Labour boss has made them LESS likely to support the party, even as he attracts thousands of youth voters with his radical message.Even diehard Labour supporters say theyve been pushed away, disgusted by the partys extreme foreign policy, runaway spending plans and anti-Semitism crisis.Sam Stopp, 27, has been a Labour councillor for four years - but is now thoroughly disillusioned by Mr Corbyns leadership.He told The Sun: It’s got to a point now that’s completely toxic, and there’s no way back for the forces of sanity in the party.The thing that really sped up the decision was anti-Semitism - it’s so detestable what’s going on at every level of the party.When you’re going to bed every night worrying about the party you’re in, it’s not a great situation.Not only is he not standing for re-election in Brent, West London at tomorrows council election - he has resigned from the party altogether.While some ex-Labour types initially gave Mr Corbyn the benefit of the doubt - Nimco said she kind of liked him when he took over - others were turned off from the moment he became leader.Edinburgh-based student Robbie Travers, 21, said: I resigned on the day Corbyn became leader.I’ve always been a supporter of the Blairite wing of the Labour party - that wing no longer exists.He told The Sun he was disturbed by Mr Corbyns foreign policy stance, including supporting the Kremlins line on the Salisbury poisoning and Syria chemical attack.Robbie also said he was outraged by the growth of anti-Semitism - admitting that the downside of no longer being a Labour member is that he cant fight for the rights of Jewish activists from the inside.Ms Ali, who moved to Cardiff as a child after fleeing Somalia with her family, said she fears Labour has a passive-aggressive attitude towards entrepreneurial ethnic minorities.She told The Sun: It’s the passive-aggressive racism of ‘stay poor, stay black’ - someone like me really baffles them. Being on the centre ground really freaks them out.How are you going to deliver better services when you’re driving out people who create wealth? They still think that the biggest issue is about keeping the jobs down the mines!None of those who spoke to us can bring themselves to vote Labour next time around - saying theyll back whichever party can keep Mr Corbyn out of power.Nimco - who joined Labour when Gordon Brown was leader - said: I’m happy to back the Tory party to keep Corbyn and his Shadow Cabinet out of power.The Labour party doesn’t represent the people that it says it speaks for. I want them to change - but there’s no hope for them.Robbie added: I would actively vote Conservative at elections to undermine Corbyn’s Labour party.I think Jeremy Corbyn is very much a red line in terms of ever supporting the Labour party again.And Sam - despite being a Labour official until recently - concluded: I would have to vote against Labour because it comes down to a choice between party and country.

We share the same blood.We are living with each other. We are brothers.”The Koreas said they hope the parties will be able to declare an official end to the war by the end of this year.President Moon said that the two countries would work to re-unite families who had been separated by the decades long conflict as Kim did what his father and grandfather never managed.The dictator said his heart was throbbing as he became the first North Korean leader to cross the 38th parallel since the Korean War ended 65 years ago.Kim even quipped about his missile tests saying he wouldnt disturb the Souths early morning sleep anymore."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403021594.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tory mp peter bone vows to erect statue honouring theresa may after she delivers brexit","story":"Brexiteer Peter Bone praised the Prime Ministers decision to follow through with leaving the bloc, and promised his constituents would cheer her on.He told MPs at Prime Ministers Questions today that should she wish, she would be carried shoulder high through the streets to the echoing of cheering crowds if she came to visit his area after Brexit.The MP for Wellingborough said he would show he the sight where a statue to the Brexit Queen will be erected, to which Mrs May replied: How can I refuse?And he looked forward to the time when in 331 days, 11 hours, 40 minutes and 22 seconds, the Prime Minister will be leading us out of the European Union... we will stop sending billions of pounds every year to the EU and well make our own laws in our own country judged by our own judges.The rendition got him cheers from other Brexit supporters on the Tory benches.Today Mrs Mays Brexit cabinet met to thrash out their position on a future customs partnership.But Brexiteers have firmly rejected the idea, saying its unworkable and would effectively mean staying in the EU.Being a part of a customs agreement with the EU would mean abiding by their trading rules, and being unable to strike deals with other countries outside the area.But it is thought that the cabinet have put off making a decision just yet - possibly to avoid tensions ahead of tomorrows local elections.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Healey said: “Over three years after they promised a big new scheme of ‘starter homes’ for first-time buyers, Tory Ministers have spent £250 million but not a single home has been built.“This is a betrayal of young Brits looking for help to buy a first home.”He added: “There are now a million fewer home-owners under 45 than in 2010 but the Tories are doing too little to give working people on ordinary incomes a hand up. Ministers should get a grip.”Ex-Housing Minister Gavin Barwell – now the PM’s chief of staff – last year insisted the first Starter Homes would be built in 2017.New Housing Minister Dominic Raab earlier this year insisted that various other Government programmes – such as Help to Buy, Right to Buy and Rent to Buy - had helped 433,000 Brits to buy a home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I assume that is why the reactions are quite stronger.Many locals are thought to have complained and made some pretty stiff objections to the eye-catching sculpture, made by the Austrian art collective Getlitin.The piece is part of an exhibition called Antwerp Baroque 2018: Rubens Inspires which opens at the start of June.The exhibition refers to one of Antwerps most famous sons, the baroque master painter Peter Paul Rubens who is known for his nudes of voluptuous women.The museum invited 16 artists to submit art which was inspired by baroque landscaping elements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403099330.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apps kids cant read maps","story":"Sir Anthony Seldon said there was a risk that technology designed to make our lives easier was “infantilising” people.He told an artificial intelligence conference in London: “Too many young people cannot read maps — they just tap in the destination, have the machine in front of them and it’s telling them.”Sir Anthony, the vice- chancellor of Buckingham University, warned: “We mortgage out our thinking to machines that make our lives simpler, but less worthwhile.”He also said many new university students were unable to fend for themselves after being “spoon-fed at their state school.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry, 33, joked he “got down on one knee” to ask Wills to return the favour he had performed for him at his wedding to Kate in 2011.Here are the other key players — minus of course, the family member Harry would most liked to have attended, his beloved mother Diana.He was with Harry on the infamous lads’ trip to Las Vegas in 2012 when Harry played pool while naked. Skippy was also there when the royal jumped into a ­nightclub swimming pool in Croatia fully clothed in 2011.CHARLIE VAN STRAUBENZEE, 29: Has known Harry since their days at Ludgrove Prep School in Berkshire. Old Harrovian Charlie works in finance and is due to marry film-maker Daisy Jenks, 27, later this year.TOM VAN STRAUBENZEE, 35: Charlie’s elder brother, hard-partying “Vans” is a friend of both Wills and Harry and was married to Lady Melissa Percy, daughter of the Duke of Northumberland, before their bitter divorce two years ago.ADAM BIDWELL, 42: Stockbroker “Bidders”, as Harry calls him, dated singer Katherine Jenkins in 2013. He was on the infamous Vegas trip with Harry and Skippy.ARTHUR LANDON, 37: Another Vegas survivor, he inherited £500million when his land-owning dad Tim died in 2007, allowing him to accompany Harry on his jaunts.Before the Vegas trip he posted a snap of his suitcase showing he had packed a gas mask and several fancy dress outfits.WILLIAM VAN CUTSEM, 38: Prince George’s godfather and a life-long friend of Wills and Harry. Prince Charles’s closest friend was William’s dad Hugh van Cutsem and all the princes attended his funeral in 2013.MARK DYER, 52: Prince Charles’s equerry acted as a surrogate second older brother to Harry after Diana died. The former Army officer is married to Texan heiress Amanda Kline and Harry is very close to both. Meghan was pictured with the couple last June, watching Harry play polo.JESSICA MULRONEY, 37: Meghan’s BFF from Toronto and daughter-in-law of former Canadian PM Brian Mulroney. Has helped Meghan plan wedding and pick dress designer.LINDSAY ROTH, 36: Meghan’s best pal from university in the US, now lives in London with lawyer husband Gavin Jordan.She and Meghan have often holidayed together and Lindsay once said: “We’re the kind of friends who can be 3,000 miles away and still be talking about or thinking the same thing.”PRINCESS CHARLOTTE, 3: Wills and Kate’s cutie-pie daughter is guaranteed to steal the show. Has already practised flower girl duties at Auntie Pippa’s wedding last May.BENITA LITT’s twin daughters, 5: As one of their mother’s closest friends, Meghan has acted as the girls’ “fairy godmother” and last year helped the family decorate their Christmas tree.Benita launched bag company Legend of Lido in the States and also runs her own brand agency which helps others to start their own businesses.Harry and Meghan visited the royal mews at Buckingham Palace to select the Ascot Landau, built in 1883, for the procession after their ceremony.He was in one of two used for Wills and Kate in 2011.If it rains, the 1830 Scottish State Coach is on standby.IVY MULRONEY, 4: The daughter of bridesmaid Jessica and her husband Ben is a regular on her mum’s Instagram page with its 109,000 followers.Christened Isabel but known as Ivy, she has already appeared in a fashion photoshoot for ­Canadian jewellery brand Birks, whose rings and necklaces Meghan has often worn.PRINCE GEORGE, 4: He threw a toddler tantrum at Auntie Pippa’s wedding last year, so mum Kate will be hoping he is on his best behaviour with his great Gan Gan, the Queen, in the congregation on May 19.It will only have been four weeks since the birth of his little brother Louis, so nanny Maria Borrallo will be on hand to keep the youngsters in order.JASPER DYER, 5: In April 2017, Harry revealed he has “five or six” godchildren, one of whom is thought to be Jasper, son of usher Mark Dyer.DORIA RAGLAND, 61: As Harry’s future mum-in-law, social worker Doria clearly gave her seal of approval to the match — she was the first of Meghan’s family to meet Harry and she flew 2,500 miles from her LA home to Toronto for the closing of the Prince’s Invictus Games last September.Doria is also a yoga instructor, so should be able to show the couple some relaxation exercises in case of wedding day jitters.THOMAS MARKLE SENIOR, 72: The former TV lighting director worked on iconic shows such as Married With Children. One thing Harry can be sure of — his future father-in-law knows all about ­marriage, having been wed twice himself.Meghan was just six when her parents divorced in 1987. There have been some concerns as to whether Thomas, now living in retirement in New Mexico, will make the wedding and meet Harry for the first time. But he is said to have bought a new suit, has got his plane ticket and is determined to walk his daughter down the aisle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People have been in to see Theresa May in the last 24, 48 hours and see just sits there and doesn’t say anything.“She’s like a corpse, all the blood has drained out of her. If they do this people are going to start putting in more letters to Graham Brady.”Tonight Labour MP Stephen Doughty blasted: “The Government’s negotiation with itself is going about as well as its negotiations with the EU.“With less than six months to go before the final Brexit deal is supposed to be agreed, Ministers are still fighting among themselves about which of their two discredited customs proposals to persist with.”And the pro-EU best for Britain campaign said the PM must “get a grip and lead in the national interest.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
