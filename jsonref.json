We step inside the yurt-inspired hub that’s fixing their culture shockVisit Ulaanbaatar on Google Earth – the only way most of us are likely to get there for some time – and you will find that the Mongolian capital looks like no other city. Scattered around the Soviet-era urban centre are hundreds of thousands of tiny white dots. It is as if someone has emptied an enormous bag of confetti across the landscape, the white specks clustering in the folds of the valleys, extending outwards for miles in long, snaking tendrils.These dots – separated in their own plot and sometimes accompanied by the orange rectangle of a tin-roofed shack, visible when you zoom in close – are yurts (or gers in Mongolian). For thousands of years, these transportable tents, made of wooden latticework wrapped with insulating felt and canvas, have been the house type of choice for the Mongolian herders on the plains. But the nomadic tent-based mindset is not something easily given up when herders move to the city – with problematic results.“Mongolia is the least densely populated country in the world,” says Badruun Gardi, who grew up in Ulaanbaatar and in 2016 founded GerHub, a nonprofit social enterprise that helps people adjust to the challenges of urban life. “When you’re a herder, you can go for miles and miles without reaching another family. You don’t have to think about what living in a confined space with hundreds or thousands of people means. It’s the biggest challenge we face as a country.”The idea of a fixed capital has always been a strange concept for this nation of nomadic herders. The 13th-century conqueror Genghis Khan ruled his vast empire from a nine-metre-wide yurt, while Ulaanbaatar itself used to be a nomadic settlement, formed by thousands of tents gathering around a movable monastery, following wherever the herds of livestock decided to travel. The Soviets attempted to formalise the capital in the 1920s, changing its name from Urga (Ulaanbaatar means “Red Hero”), building concrete blocks of flats and setting out an urban grid, which was consolidated in the postwar era. But, as thousands have flocked to the city in recent years, driven by the loss of livestock and promises of better education, healthcare and job prospects, the capital has expanded outwards in all directions as a sprawling ger-opolis. The adjustment from life on the open steppe to the hustle of the big city clearly takes some getting used to.For starters, the world outside the ger is no longer rolling grassland, but a small private plot, encircled by a two-metre-high fence. City residents must pay for water and fuel, rely on transportation and manage their waste. Their inidual actions have an impact on others, sometimes for the first time in their lives they encounter common problems that become the responsibility of a collective body of people. These social challenges are exacerbated by a host of practical issues: there is no running water in the ger districts, nor is there mains electricity, sewerage or central heating. In winter, when temperatures can plummet to -40C, each household burns around three to five tonnes of coal, making Ulaanbaatar one of the most polluted cities in the world. And the scale of the challenge is only increasing.Gardi founded GerHub to help bring a sense of pride back to the ger districts. After a few years of working in whatever spaces it could find, the organisation’s educational and social outreach programme has a new home, in the form of a contemporary take on the traditional ger, designed by the Hong Kong architecture studio Rural Urban Framework (RUF).Standing as a faceted polycarbonate pavilion in the midst of a muddled ger neighbourhood in the Songino Khairkhan district, the Ger Innovation Hub is a striking arrival. Its shimmering plastic walls envelop a slender wooden framework, which itself wraps around an inner space defined by mud-brick walls. In summer, the entire thing can open up, the wall panels lifting to let activities spill out into the surrounding landscape, while in the harsh winter, the layered structure creates a sheltered buffer.“We were inspired by the structure of the ger itself,” says Joshua Bolchover, cofounder of RUF, a research-led practice based in the University of Hong Kong, whose students helped to build the project. “We thought, what if we peel the layers of timber, insulation and waterproofing apart to create a room within a room, like a Russian doll?” The resulting structure (judging from the photographs) creates a loosely defined series of spaces that can be adapted to all kinds of activities, from preschool playtime to innovation workshops for teenagers, training sessions for local businesses and drop-in meet-ups for the elderly.The layered design means that, if it’s -40C outside, it would be about 0C (32F) in the buffer zone (“Fine for kids to run around with their coats on,” says Bolchover), thanks to solar gain trapped by the polycarbonate cladding, while the central space would only need to be heated to 15C, the warmth radiating from the thermal mass of the mud walls. A circular amphitheatre at the centre of the space has been sized so that a ger can be erected over it too, creating an even more insulated central core for more intimate gatherings.“We want it to be as lively a place as possible,” says Gardi. “In winter it can be particularly arduous being stuck indoors for months on end, so we hope this will be a place for social life to happen and new community ties to be formed.”Unfortunately, the building only had the chance to host an opening workshop before the coronavirus lockdown halted all activities in the city – Mongolia took particularly prudent early action, with few cases of Covid-19 and no deaths so far. Hopefully when the centre does reopen it will become a vital social hub to help this fledgling community form neighbourhood bonds and reap the benefits of their newly urban life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee8cf0a0ee50d839de5501a8946e702da9a75851/3_222_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7091558deef17308b620868003fe98ef","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Physical distancing, lockdown and protests about the death of Ahmaud Arbery – the most striking photographs from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c42c17b051d96815b3b862fd59b2c8f6368f185e/0_0_2481_3508/master/2481.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fc373920984f5601942e65cdc2538be 700w","title":"bp chief says covid has deepened commitment to net zero emissions","story":"Pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil, says Bernard LooneyBP’s new chief executive said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has deepened his commitment to shrinking the oil giant’s carbon footprint to zero.Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil firm in February, said he was “more convinced than ever” that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets.He told the  that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is “deeper” due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.“I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it,” he said. “The pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term.”Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends. This raises serious questions over the business models of major oil companies, which are already under pressure due to tougher climate action and the rise of renewable energy.“We’re all living and working differently right now. Not all of that will stick, but some of it will stick for sure. The question I have is whether consumers will consume less, and I think there is a possibility that they will,” Looney said.The world’s oil demand has fallen to 25-year lows following the outbreak of Covid-19, which has severely limited demand for transport fuels, causing global oil prices to fall by two-thirds. The oil market crisis has wiped billions from major oil companies, including BP which reported a loss for the first quarter of this year.“I think this will remind people of the fragility of the ecosystem that we work in people are looking up at the skies and seeing less pollution, and I do hope that there will be an even greater appreciation for nature as we move forward, which should keep the climate at the forefront of public debate,” he added.Looney began his tenure as BP boss by promising that the oil company would invest more in clean energy and less in fossil fuels over the next three decades as part of an ambition to become a carbon neutral business by 2050. The plan will use carbon offsets, such as tree-planting and emissions capture technology, to mitigate the fossil fuels it will continue to produce by the middle of the century.“Do the near-term issues cause us to be able to invest a little less than I would have liked in these next couple of years? Possibly,” he said. “But I do believe that we will remain true to what we said on 12 February that over time, we will invest more into non-carbon businesses and less into hydrocarbon businesses.”The pressure facing oil producers has increased as investors begin to turn their backs on fossil fuels in favour of green energy, which is cheaper and offers more predictable returns.This year, US oil prices plunged below zero for the first time, while BP’s solar energy business, Lightsource, struck new US solar power contracts totaling 400MW, Looney said, which underlines the resilience of the business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1f2a88da03aa47b8c7b60a6cd964d6f20939a9/0_133_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06d662296b2c23474e127bd55c2b5b53","title":"how england found itself at the foot of the covid 19 league table","story":"Excess deaths, the stats that really count, show that England is paying the price for poor governmentAs the data rolls in from the Covid-19 pandemic it is a bit like watching the football scores, but only for the teams at the wrong end of the table.The results for every country are poor: it’s simply that some appear to be doing worse than others. France saw bigger falls in output than Germany, Spain or Italy in the first three months of 2020: the US has seen the sharpest increase in unemployment.In truth, it is too early to make international comparisons. The UK took a smaller hit to activity than France in the first three months of the year but it went into lockdown later. There may be nothing more to it than that.Similarly, the jobless rate in the US is higher than in the UK for two reasons: the Americans get their unemployment figures out quicker and don’t have a furloughing scheme to soften the blow to the labour market.Making assumptions now about which country has fared least badly from the pandemic is no different from making rash predictions about which team will be relegated three games into the season. If the history of the last recession is any guide, the US will bounce back faster than the UK or the eurozone.Governments are sensitive to international economic comparisons, but they are even more prickly when it comes to mortality league tables. You don’t need to be a genius to understand why Boris Johnson has ceased to publish details of how well Britain is doing compared to the rest of the Europe. As Keir Starmer helpfully pointed out last week, you need to look no further than the fact that the UK has had more deaths than any other country.Ministers and health officials say that comparing the headline figures for deaths is misleading, and in one sense they are right. France has a lower death toll than Britain but that might be expected given that it has roughly the same number of people living in a country that is twice as big. Population density is clearly a factor when it comes to the spread of Covid-19.There is, though, a way to refine the data so that more meaningful international comparisons can be made. This is done by comparing a country’s excess deaths: the difference between the mortality rate this year with what happened in the past.This is what two Oxford University economists, Janine Aron and John Muellbauer, have done in a new paper. It shows England’s peak in excess deaths was not just higher than that in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland but the highest of 24 European countries.England also had the highest excess death rate for the over-65s and – perhaps even more worryingly – had far and away the worst record for excess deaths for those age between 15 and 64 as well. At its peak it was 2.8 times worse than the weekly peak in the next worst country, Spain, around four times worse than France and Belgium, and more than five times worse than in Italy.These are sobering findings, particularly in the light of England coming out of lockdown faster than Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.As Aron and Muellbauer note, there are plenty of reasons why England’s excess death rate is so high. The first is the role of London as a major global hub, with a high population density and a transport system that makes social distancing difficult. London had the highest number of cases of Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic and it is not hard to see why.A second factor is that it took time for the government to decide a lockdown was necessary. By that time, the virus had taken hold and was being transmitted in London. By the time it reached less densely populated parts of the UK the lockdown had been enforced.Thirdly, the UK was in no fit state to deal with the crisis. The paper notes: “Generally, there was a collective failure in preparedness across the public health system, especially for testing capability and adequate supplies and distribution logistics of personal protection equipment for health workers.”The findings for the 15-64 age group need to be looked at alongside the government’s own data, which shows much higher Covid-19 related death rates in areas of economic deprivation. Underlying health tends to be worse in the poorer parts of the country, and they contain more low-paid employees who work in face-to-face sectors: care workers, bus drivers, supermarket cashiers.The Office for National Statistics has helpfully broken down deaths for England and Wales from Covid-19 by occupational group. Among men, security guards and care workers fare worst. Among women care workers have around 2.4 times the death rates of the average for working age women, suggesting they have been particularly let down by a lack of protective gear and by the failure to test, trace and isolate. The comparative ratio for nurses is 1.3 times the average for working age women.Ministers don’t like to be reminded of it, but Germany has done far, far better than the UK, and England in particular. Its decentralised model for testing was streets ahead of Britain’s top-down centralised approach. It had more hospital beds, more intensive care units and more ventilators per head of population. It started testing more quickly, which facilitated effective tracing. Investment in PPE occurred earlier and Germany did better than other countries to keep the virus out of care homes.One of the favourite sayings of football managers is that the table never lies. This one doesn’t either. The government’s handling of Covid-19 has been poor from the start and it is about time it was held to account for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b871508ec40e5701e64e52b8219e109f1946173/0_151_4767_2860/master/4767.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6034d7da5e9b05183550c46792793cbd","title":"investing in firms with better record on social issues pays study finds","story":"BlackRock analysis shows investments more resilient during Covid-19 market crashInvesting in companies with better records on social issues and good governance pays according to the world’s largest asset manager, with those investments having proved to be more financially resilient during the coronavirus market crash.BlackRock’s analysis, co-authored by the company’s vice-chairman Philipp Hildebrand, suggested that companies with stronger “social” scores on factors such as better customer relations and better workforce management did better in the turmoil, as did those whose boards were judged to be more effective and independent.“Companies with strong profiles on material sustainability issues have potential to outperform those with poor profiles,” the report said. “In particular, we believe companies managed with a focus on sustainability should be better positioned versus their less sustainable peers to weather adverse conditions while still benefiting from positive market environments.”However, environmental factors – the focus of much ESG investment – were not responsible for outperformance. Neither was the relative lack of oil companies in ESG funds behind the outperformance, the report said, despite the collapse in oil prices weighing heavily on fossil fuel producers’ shares.The outperformance of higher-ESG-rated companies was evident across stocks and bonds.The data suggests that sustainable investments can also be financially rewarding for investors – contrary to the common perception that investors in sustainable companies will pay a price for more “moral” investments.The investor has faced strident criticism from activists for being a relative laggard in relation to other investors when voting on environmental issues at companies, although it says it focuses on engagement with company bosses rather than using its votes to force changes.Less than $500bn of BlackRock’s assets have some element of screening out companies on various criteria, such as moral or religious reasons, but only about $100bn of that is managed according to full ESG criteria.

In France, it was decided to curtail championships and award trophies on the basis of matches already played. In the Netherlands, the season was simply voided. The unfortunate players and supporters of SC Cambuur, who were 11 points clear at the top of the second ision, are understandably miffed.The English Premier League is fretfully keeping its fingers crossed, hoping that Germany’s experiment in “bio-secure” football works. The richest football league in the world hopes to relaunch its own competition sometime in June. Whether that is desirable or feasible has been the subject of fierce debate. If Project Restart is given the go-ahead this week, players are expected to begin non-contact training together, but the planning process has been fraught with difficulty. Some players have voiced deep reservations over safety. Protocols have yet to be finalised for a second phase, when full training will recommence. There is also concern that, after a long and unusual layoff, players have no hope of reaching proper match fitness before June. A glut of summer injuries might therefore accompany the 92 fixtures scheduled for empty stadiums, during a hectic seven-week period.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has suggested that the completion of the Premier League season would “lift the spirits of the nation”. It is true that the mass exposure of the national game in pubs and on TV has woven it into the fabric of many lives. But this rush back to the pitch is being dictated by financial imperatives rather than a desire to boost collective morale. Clubs stand to lose at least £300m in broadcast money from around the world, if they fail to complete the season. Many rely on these contracts to pay huge wages that have grown exponentially since the Premier League launched in 1992. Multimillion-pound sponsors will also demand rebates if they feel they have been short-changed.Money talks, but it should not be allowed to bully. If players are to return so soon to a sport in which unpredictable physical contact is an obligation, there must be maximum confidence in testing procedures and in the efficacy of the “protective bubble” around pitch and stadium. And teams should be match-ready. Should Project Restart prove unworkable in the short summer timeframe, so be it.If the league does resume, the matches are likely to be eerie, stilted affairs. Football without fans is not so much a new normal as a different event altogether. Liverpool would at least get the chance to deservedly win the Premier League in the traditional fashion. But safety, not the prospect of glory or the need to sustain turnover, must call the shots in the weeks to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67dc7b7edb8270f1ab2709c9a2bb6220ffdcd3c9/0_60_3265_1959/master/3265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbb54581f147c27e24c115709480d46","title":"the guardian view on uk covid 19 coordination work together save lives","story":"The four-nations approach works better than countries taking different paths. It is time to rebuild a collective approach to fighting the virusA week ago, 27 million viewers watched as Boris Johnson signalled the first steps out of the Covid-19 lockdown. The aim of providing a route out of lockdown was a reasonable one. But the strategy and execution were badly mishandled and confused. The botched broadcast fractured a valuable existing consensus. At a stroke, a unified UK-wide approach was cast aside. A week ago, Mr Johnson became in effect the leader not of the United Kingdom but of England alone.Mr Johnson’s announcements were not followed by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. Instead they chose to stick to the lockdown. This ision among the partner nations was avoidable. It is also unhelpful to their citizens as a whole. The error was Mr Johnson’s. He needs to focus urgently on restoring a common approach across the four nations that avoids what the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, has called a London-centric approach. There are, of course, underlying political tensions in the four-nation relationship, and within each nation too, but they had not disrupted the fight against the virus until last week.The Welsh government’s handling points to a better way forward. On Friday, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, did what Mr Johnson should have done. He made his own statement at the same time as launching a detailed and realistic document on unlocking, with an easily understood “traffic light” approach to eventual easing in different contexts. Where Mr Johnson was bullish, blustering and baffling, Mr Drakeford was careful, calibrated and clear. Unlike Mr Johnson, with his anachronistic idea of gung-ho leadership, Mr Drakeford made clear that he is trying to lead a continuing and reasoned conversation. This is a much more modern and devolution-aware approach, which Keir Starmer correctly underscored at the weekend, as well as far better suited to the complexities and risks of the pandemic. Similar approaches have been taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.The four-nations approach to the emergency is a valuable asset for the UK. It has the virtues of clarity and coordination. Above all, it was and is the right public health approach. Health policy has long been a devolved responsibility in the UK. It was devolved even before political devolution in the late 1990s. But the virus – like science – knows no borders, either of nations or of what used to be called health authorities. Faced with an enemy like Covid-19, it is irresponsible, as well as dangerously ineffective, for different parts of a nation state like Britain to adopt sweepingly different approaches. For that reason alone, joint decision-making remains essential.There will be an increasing case, when the pandemic fades, for different approaches in different communities on a local level. There are signs of that already. But the key point is that these differences should be determined by science and by local public health needs, not by the UK’s internal borders. Despite last week’s unilateral English lurch by Mr Johnson, many of the differences of approach remain reconcilable. It is therefore time to compromise for the common good. Last week, Mr Johnson’s previously enviable ratings slumped. He doesn’t do contrition, but the more sensitive tone he adopted in a weekend press article shows that he knows there is a problem.There are many reasons why a collective approach should be re-established for the remainder of the pandemic. The protection of public health is overwhelmingly the main one. But politics is important too. Each part of the UK is governed by a different party. Partisan issues will never be entirely separable from a shared process of this kind. But they must not dominate it. If you need a warning about what the partisan politicisation of Covid-19 can do, look no further than the unfolding catastrophe in the United States and to what Barack Obama said at the weekend. The life and death issues involved in the fight against the pandemic are much too important for the UK to go down that disastrous road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00025c4e0b7925b363bedf3a49c0531928b6a44a/0_0_2529_1516/master/2529.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24dfea466eb0a9744baf7f3dac7569c7 940w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of treasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘treasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘treasure’.Share your photos of what treasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 May at 10am.

Jay Rayner explores our enduring love affair with the cuisine of France If you attempted, in these shrunken times, to discern the nation’s tastes by thumbing through takeaway food apps, you might conclude that we adore anything as long as it’s got a dough base, is tottering in a bun, or drenched in sriracha. I’m not complaining. I like all these things. I am often to be found up to my unshaven armpits in sriracha. But one thing is noticeable on these apps by its rarity: French food.There may be something generational going on here that the demographic using Deliveroo, Uber Eats and the rest simply doesn’t go hunting through the digital meadows for a good cassoulet when they’re hungry. Also, many French classics are far less portable than Korean chicken wings. Soupe à l’oignon, complete with a crouton and gruyère lid, in a plastic box, may well arrive looking like a Portaloo on the third day of Glastonbury.But there’s something else. A takeaway Chinese is a domestic ritual the grammar of which we understand. We associate French food with a restaurant experience. For many of us – and yes, this may also be generational – what comes to mind first when we hear the word “restaurant” is the classic French bistro. There will be checked tablecloths. There will be wooden chairs, with more than a hint of art nouveau in the spindle curves of their backs. There will be wine and a plate of something that speaks not just to appetite but also to memory.That vivid, erse takeaway offering is exactly what we’d want to see in a vivid, erse society like ours. What’s surprising is just how sturdily the French restaurant has endured in the midst of it. Recently, I scanned back through 20 years of reviews. The first column which brought me feedback was about three months into the job in 1999. It was of a bistro in Brighton called La Fourchette, where they served a nage de poissons full of mullet, crab and mussels in an intense liquor the colour of a leather-bound book. I received sheaths of handwritten letters cooing over that one.The last restaurant I reviewed before the lockdown was the Flying Frenchman La Canteen, with its terrines, cassoulet and crème brûlée. Aided by the convenience of the digital, the response was even more clamorous. In between there has been a constant Gallic twang: a rabbit and langoustine terrine at Purslane in Cheltenham, an ox cheek bordelaise at the Honours in Edinburgh, plentiful duck confit at Comptoir Gascon in London’s Smithfield, and so very much more. I have measured out my life, very happily, in daubes and rum babas.Many of my close friends, asked where they want to go first after lockdown, mention Brasserie Zedel in London’s Soho, a faithful homage to the Parisian brasseries, which opened in 2012, and which serves a cracking steak haché and choucroute garnie to a 350-seater dining room that was rarely empty. It’s not just the food. It’s, oh, the everything.I could give you the history now. I could take you through the arrival of the Huguenots in the 16th century, and the impact of the French revolution on the cooking in England’s grand houses in the 18th. I should mention Auguste Escoffier at the Savoy. There must be a nod to L’Escargot, which once had a snail farm in the cellar, and of course, Mon Plaisir, one of London’s oldest French restaurants, marked by its flamboyantly large tricolour.Instead, I want to cut straight to the important stuff. Obviously, that’s Robin’s Nest, the spinoff sitcom from Man About the House, starring Richard O’Sullivan as the languorous Robin Tripp. It ran for 48 episodes from 1977 to 1981. Robin’s Nest did indeed have checked tablecloths and curving-backed wooden chairs, plus a stuffed bear. Most importantly its chef patron was the uber-modern 70s male: at ease with himself and his tastes. Which meant he was great in the kitchen. Which meant, like a Len Deighton spy, he could cook French food.“I think we all had the idea then, that the French knew what to do with food and we didn’t,” co-writer Brian Cooke told me when I asked why Tripp’s restaurant was a French bistro. “Plus, in Man About the House, Tripp had always said he wanted a little French restaurant, so we gave him what he wanted.” In the first episode Tripp convinces his girlfriend’s father, played by Tony Britton, to invest in the bistro by cooking him a roast leg of “d’agneau nouvelle saison et pommes sarladaises”.Cooke and his co-writer, Johnnie Mortimer, had sniffed the air and understood which way British society was moving. Within a decade, the UK’s modern restaurant boom would kick off, with four key openings in 1987. One, the River Café at Thames Wharf, served Italian peasant food priced for plutocrats. Two more were avowedly French: Bibendum, in Chelsea, with Simon Hopkinson at the stove, was all the classics – escargot, steak au poivre, chocolate pithiviers for dessert – done as well as possible. Meanwhile, at Harveys in Wandsworth, Marco Pierre White was knocking out high-end French food with a box-shouldered 80s gloss. The fourth restaurant was Kensington Place, where Rowley Leigh was famed for his modern European menu. But even that included a jellied daube of beef and a chicken and goat’s cheese mousse, which couldn’t be more French if the writers of The Simpsons were in charge of the stereotypes.Henry Harris has spent much of his career gifting us rugged French food. He was part of the original brigade at Bibendum, then had his own restaurant, Racine. He now oversees a London pub group where the menu can include rillettes and rabbit in mustard sauce. When I called him, he had just put the makings of a rillette in the oven at home. I asked him to describe the appeal of the French restaurant. “I always direct people to the French word ‘restauration’, meaning to restore, from which the word restaurant comes. Of course, a good bistro delivers great dishes, but it’s the other bits: a decent napkin, a white plate, a good glass for wine. It’s a hello from the manager. I’m here to look after you and make sure you leave happier than when you came in.”These things are obviously not exclusive to the French restaurant. And in Paris the waiters can sometimes compete for an Olympic gold in rudeness. But the British French restaurant is something else. It’s a place designed, in our imagination, to convince us everything is going to be OK. Unsurprisingly, that’s what many of us crave right now. For the moment though I’ll just have to make do with old episodes of Robin’s Nest.A group of over two dozen hospitality business leaders, led by Alan Lorrimer of the Piano Works live music bars, has written to the government calling for a relaxation of licensing and zoning laws to enable the creation of what they are calling a Grand Summer Outdoor Café in the UK’s cities. The proposal is based on an initiative in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, which has launched a vast outdoor seating plan, across pavements and squares, enabling customers to have physically distanced drinks and meals.The Cartford Inn, at Little Eccleston in Lancashire, has launched TOTI – short for Taste Of The Inn – at home. They are offering a changing set of menus for the long weekend, with delivery, which is free if the address is within a short distance of the pub. Thursday is burger night and for Sunday lunches there’s a roast. The menu for Friday and Saturday includes the likes of corned beef fritters with brown sauce and crisp onions, and their much loved – by me – braised oxtail and beef suet pudding. Orders must be placed in advance.

I could have used them up in a seeded fruit cake, but what felt more useful right now was a recipe within reach of anyone, maybe someone who has never cooked before. A recipe that won’t mind if you mix and match the ingredients according to what’s left in the cupboard. Which is why I dug out Mum’s flapjack recipe, the first thing I ever cooked with her a recipe that in addition to being up for a few additions from the store cupboard, carries with it the warm scent of butter and golden syrup and baking oats and tells you, almost more than any other, that everything is going to be all right.I am currently rather grateful for these sort of recipes, the ones that are happy with a bit of give and take. The type of cooking that is cool with a cook’s “more or less” attitude to weights and measures. In particular, I appreciate recipes that allow you to make substitutions when ingredients won’t come to hand.Another straightforward dish, this time of the spring dinner kind, is one of baked chicken cooked with stock and then any vegetables you have around. My first was a rather seasonal mix of peas and lettuce, yet I could have used tender-leaved early chard or broad beans. I used stock that I had around, but I could have embellished it with ease – upending the dregs of a bottle of white vermouth into the stock would have added interest without overwhelming the green spring flavours. The green olives I dropped in at the last minute brought a welcome salty, slightly bitter quality, but I could have easily used a few capers or tiny cornichons. If none had been available I may have resorted to a splash of tarragon vinegar and an even more generous pinch of salt.The lettuce leaves take on a silky texture in the oven, with the stems retaining something of their crispness. Cos and little gem are the most suitable, the exceptionally fragile leaves of the round butterhead variety probably less so. Serves 2olive or vegetable oil 3 tbspchicken thighs 4, largeleeks 200gchicken or vegetable stock 1 litrelettuce 2, little gem or similargreen olives 12peas 300g (shelled or frozen weight)parsley or chervil a small handfulWarm the oil in a deep, ovenproof pan, then add the chicken pieces, skin side down and lightly seasoned, and cook until the skin is a rich golden colour. Turn them and colour the underside similarly, then remove from the pan and set aside.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Trim the leeks, discarding any tough, dark leaves. Cut them into short pieces about the length of a wine cork, then wash thoroughly, removing every grain of grit trapped between their layers.Pat the leeks dry, then fry them in the chicken pan over a moderate heat, so they soften without browning. Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, stirring as you go, then return the chicken to the pan. Place in the oven and bake for 25 minutes.Wash the lettuce and cut each head in half from root end to leaf tip. Remove the chicken from the oven and tuck the lettuce around it, then add the olives. Tip in the peas and return to the oven for another 20 minutes.Check the seasoning, then add any small herb leaves and serve in bowls, with spoons for the broth.Use whatever appropriate seeds you have to hand, but in the interests of texture I try to use a mixture of sizes. For this batch I used an equal weight of large pumpkin and sunflower seeds, with just 10g each of diminutive linseed and sesame. If you use only large seeds the flapjacks may well fall apart. The mixture of dried fruits I used was roughly equal amounts of golden sultanas, dried cherries, mulberries and candied orange peel, but I could have used apricots, raisins or dried cranberries.You will also need a shallow baking tin – a roasting tin will do – about 22cm x 24cm, lined with baking parchment. Makes 12Melt the butter in a deep saucepan. Set the oven at 170Cgas mark 3. Add the golden syrup to the melted butter then stir in the sugar and let it melt.Stir both sizes of oats into the melted butter and sugar together with a generous pinch of salt. Remove the pan from the heat, then stir in dried fruits, nuts and seeds.Tip the mixture into the baking tin and gently smooth the surface level, but do not compress or compact the mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. The flapjack is done when it starts to turn a darker gold around the edges. The centre should be firm and springy to the touch.Remove the tin from the oven and, if you wish, score, without cutting right through, into 12 rectangular pieces. I prefer to break mine into rough pieces of assorted sizes as they cool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89f659235698d97a3adc10f26a5c281cedd4ccc0/101_112_2191_1313/master/2191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9306d868a86923cd6bb692fa93ec3b","title":"union berlin bayern munich bundesliga match report","story":"It was business as usual in a comfortable victory for Bayern Munich, even if the low-key, low-volume return of the Bundesliga is still a highly unusual sight to behold.Taking three points from Union Berlin moved Germany’s champions four ahead of Borussia Dortmund, with a Der Klassiker meeting due on 26 May. Robert Lewandowski collected his customary goal with a penalty and the defender Benjamin Pavard later headed home a Joshua Kimmich corner for the second.Bayern will need to find extra gears against Dortmund, highly impressive in beating Schalke 4-0 on Saturday. Win that and an eighth successive title will be within reach. “We didn’t show our best side in terms of play,” admitted the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer afterwards. “But we dominated the game and deservedly take the three points home with us.”Union, safely in mid-table, have performed creditably since last season’s promotion but were facing the Bundesliga’s ultimate test, and doing so without home fans among the most fervent in Germany. Berlin police had warned supporters to stay away but later reported that a few dozen had gathered outside the stadium.Also absent was the Union coach, Urs Fischer, after he broke quarantine to return home to Switzerland following a family bereavement. The plan he had passed on to his players was clear, though: sit back, soak up pressure and see what else might arise.Anthony Ujah, their Nigeria forward, fired wide in the early stages but Bayern soon settled into dominance of the limited opposition. They had the ball in the net in the 18th minute, only for Thomas Müller to be ruled offside after he took a final – and unnecessary – touch of a goalbound header from Serge Gnabry. The VAR decision was greeted by a throaty roar from the small home contingent permitted to be inside the tight stadium set in a forest on the fringes of Germany’s capital.The first half-hour saw Union offer stiff resistance, reducing Lewandowski to penalty-area scraps amid some frustration for Bayern. Alphonso Davies’s high tackle on Grischa Prömel brought the Canada full-back a yellow card. Then came Neven Subotic’s flailing foul on Leon Goretzka, who had blindsided the Serb, and a chance from the spot that Lewandowski was never going to pass up.The Polish striker scored his 40th of the season, making it the fifth season in succession he has reached that tally, with a feint, a jump and a firm shot beyond his compatriot Rafa Gikiewicz.Bayern’s attempts on goal piled up but they struggled to reproduce the slick football and threat they had exerted in pre-lockdown performances such as their late-February 3-0 Champions League win at Chelsea.Kingsley Coman, on as a second-half substitute, howled in anguish when his driven cross failed to find any takers but Pavard’s neck muscles eventually made sure of the win 10 minutes from time.A controlled performance with few scares suffered made it 15 wins from Bayern’s past 16 matches. The Dortmund encounter will, though, be far more indicative of whether the Bundesliga title is likely to return to its perennial destination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e9fb692b831bbb5f9de85e5655d3d0e8d6307/1490_956_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2018b602b77c60c9237ef881438d4c","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it’s a great supper for kids.Preparation: 10 minutesCooking time: 20 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesServes: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starterIngredients1 large red onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, crushed2 medium carrots, dicedHalf a red pepper, diced1 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz1 handful of orzo or similar small pastaSaltfreshly ground pepperParmesan cheese (including rind)1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup1 tbsp light olive oilA pinch of dried mixed herbs1 bay leaf1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional)125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional)4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional)MethodSweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy. Then you get amazing sweetness from the leek and garlic running through it all.A hearty recipe that’s bound to satisfy – if you’re making it for kids you can go easy on the chilli.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly. Warm the whole dish through to gently bubbling over a low heat, season with salt and pepper to taste. When dishing up, layer the pork belly on top.Serve with a crisp green salad and warm, crusty bread.Optional garnish – crispy onions and a handful more of chopped flat-leaf parsley and coriander.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5579439cbc8515beb59b530fe5b7aa1ea2216d6c/0_0_5445_3268/master/5445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a13737dada2119fdacf3b8a605dee39","title":"from burgers to brunches five summer comfort foods and how to make them healthier","story":"A few of our favourite meals could probably benefit from a little less fat and sugar – here’s how to cut back without going light on flavourWhen your favourite comfort food is calling, it can be hard to resist. Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers on the barbecue and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier summer makeover.Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour.Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …).Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist on the barbecue too.Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side.While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0c7bea1433f837bcacc5cf7ba7a0216d6dac85/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff387016cfba52a15b2a69c1dda02dc","title":"picking up the pieces the great jigsaw revival","story":"With time on our hands, jigsaws are having their moment. But what’s the appeal? And why are they so hypnotic? Richard Godwin speaks to puzzlers, creators and scientists to see the bigger pictureThe darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. “Teddy, where are you?” my wife called. “Forget him, he was only slowing us down,” I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves.But there is always a way through – if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. “This is a waste of life,” my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete.Yes, this was technically a sixth birthday present for our Harry Potter-mad son. Yes, we did most of it while he watched Netflix. Yes, I’m aware 500 pieces is not that many. Yes, this was a decadent amount of time to work on something so pointless. But sometimes, pointlessness is precisely the point.John Lewis is almost puzzled dry. Among its best sellers are The World of Frida Kahlo by Laurence King and Rainbow Hand by Galison. The satirical montage artist Cold War Steve has one, too, inspired by The Festival of Brexit – but this too has sold out. Wentworth, the Wiltshire-based company whose wooden fine art puzzles are highly prized by collectors, has nothing over 250 pieces.But puzzle junkies no longer care where they score their hit. “I don’t think I’d buy one of those super-twee ones of a country cottage or anything,” says Liz Vater, director of the Stoke Newington Literary Festival, who has completed four puzzles since lockdown, including a David Bowie-themed moon scene. “But if someone gave me one like that, I don’t think it would matter.” The experience is common. Jigsaws are a gateway drug to twee. You start out on a nice New Yorker cover. Soon, it’s Teddy Bears \u0026amp Tricycles.“You don’t want masses of sky or sand,” says my Granny Rose, 90, and a lifelong puzzler. “You want it to be interesting.” She grew up on jigsaws – her father only let her and her sister look at the picture once – and usually has one on the go. She likes doing them with friends or family, but in lockdown, she is on her own, working on an image of Blackpool beach that a friend dropped round. “It’s ghastly!” she laughs. “But my other jigsaws are in a high cupboard and I don’t want to risk climbing up on a chair.”It’s not too hard to see why we’re reaching for jigsaws. Margaret Drabble wrote a memoir inspired by puzzles, The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History With Jigsaws. “They provide hours of painless social intercourse or moments of peaceful, solitary retreat,” she wrote. “They give you an illusion of order and progress when all around is chaos.” There is such a thing as competitive puzzling, but this is not the point, Drabble argued. Here is a “harmonious, constructive, co-operative activity, free of the rivalry that makes so many games contentious and so many children so cross.” And if you want to do it on your own, while listening to a podcast or the birds singing, that’s fine, too.There have been studies into the cognitive effects of jigsaws. One concluded that the activity “recruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging”. But it’s possible to overthink this. Dr Abigael San of the British Psychological Society sees it as a classic mindful activity. “Focusing on detail, taking the time to relax, having an aim without pressure – all of those things are beneficial and a counter to the wider anxiety that people are feeling at the moment. It gives you a sense of control in a chaotic situation. The world is unpredictable, whereas a jigsaw puzzle is certain.” As long as no one has lost a piece.The jigsaw is thought to have been invented in 1766 by John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker whose “dissected maps” were used to teach. Jane Austen included a jigsaw in Mansfield Park (1814). The Bertram children laugh at poor cousin Fanny as she is not familiar with these fashionable toys. Adult puzzles emerged in the 20th century. At first all the pieces had straight edges. My granny remembers the “two spinsters” who lived next door to her had one like this – finally completed by the evacuee who came to stay during the war. She also remembers dedicated jigsaw libraries – of which I can find only one in England, based in a Baptist church in Exeter. Social distancing has forced it to close during lockdown. “Our clientele is usually quite elderly – people with time on their hands,” says its chairperson, Susan Hazemore. “It’s good for their eye-hand co-ordination. We have a few people who suffer from dementia and also insomnia, too. I don’t think we’ll be open until at least September now, but I am hoping that when I can go out and about a bit, I can do some delivering to people who are on our books.”For many, lockdown has been a foretaste of retirement. “Life doesn’t usually warrant a 1,000-piece jigsaw,” says Liz Vater – who realised she would have to cancel her literary festival early on and so found herself with time on her hands. “At the beginning, I had so many plans,” she says. “I was going to read all the books I have around the house. And I just wasn’t able to read. It was horrible. I always have a book on the go. But then I started a jigsaw. It does a similar thing. I was focusing in. It was quite meditative. I was processing as I was going. I’ve loved the endless hours just focusing on one task, searching for pieces defined by colour, perspective or shape.”One thing we have learned is that global catastrophes don’t introduce brand new ideas, what they do is accelerate ones that were already floating around the ether: universal basic income modern monetary theory jigsaw puzzles. When I interviewed Sir Patrick Stewart in Los Angeles three years ago, he was adamant that jigsaws were about to become the new “adult colouring books”. We were supposed to be talking about some superhero movie he was in, but he was more interested in telling me about the Picasso chair he was piecing together. “At first I was a little embarrassed about it, as it was something I’d done as a kid,” he told me. “But when I would occasionally mention it, people would whisper: ‘Oh, you do jigsaw puzzles, too? What kind? How many pieces?’ It’s like a secret society.”Goodburn of Gibsons says that jigsaws have been on a steady uptick since she joined the firm five years ago. There is a jigsaw emoji. Jigsaws were also added to the Consumer Price Index used to measure inflation in 2017 (alongside gin and almond milk). “It pre-dates coronavirus,” she says. “It’s part of the trend of looking after yourself, being more mindful, taking a digital detox.” Nostalgia is popular across age groups – one of their bestsellers is called 1980s Sweet Memories, a montage of Marathons, Opal Fruits and Jelly Tots – but they have also commissioned a new range of design-led jigsaws with a hipper audience in mind. “We have one called Avocado Park. It’s just a load of cartoon avocados having a great time in a park.”You can tell a lot about a nation by its jigsaw designs. Cats are popular. So are Spitfires. And the manically detailed, Union Jack-filled designs that Gibsons commissions often veer close to the sort of art you can imagine coming out of a Faragist dictatorship. Populist Realist Art? I ask the Observer’s art critic Laura Cumming for her verdict on The Airshow, which shows gleeful picnickers beneath a sky heavy with warplanes. She professes herself a little baffled. “The vintage planes would scalp the day-trippers, the photo-real detail seems bizarrely mismatched with the graphic kitsch and it is very strange that the hardest part of a jigsaw – long stretches of barely differentiated colour, such as sand, sea or sky – are eliminated as if the artist wanted the experience to be quick and easy. Is the idea to get through them as fast as possible and buy the next?” She reckons Pieter Bruegel the Elder is a good jigsaw artist as “you enter so intimately into his mind, piece by piece but I think Seurat is the most beautiful to do, half a dot, a whole dot, etc, as you get a deep sense of his colour alchemies. The worst I’ve ever had to do, in company with my aunt, was Renoir’s Bal du Moulin de la Galette, where every stroke melted into another.”I turn to Steve Crisp, one of the UK’s most in-demand jigsaw illustrators. “I’ll sort of do half a painting before moving on to computer, where it’s easier to move things around,” he explains. “The brief is basically, make every area of the puzzle interesting. Make sure there’s no area with too much foliage or blue sky. At the very least, there’ll be birds everywhere. I kind of pack it in.”At the moment, he’s working on a 1950s toy shop, a pop festival and a summer camp for an American company. It’s varied, but it’s always escapist. “A lot of people say when I do an image: ‘I’d like to live there,’” he says. “That’s the aim – to get that feeling for people. Hoping everything’s fine and lovely. I mean, we all like that, don’t we?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f4f53199a1028120e8eff694e585f17c3e83919/0_446_7216_4330/master/7216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a58aba14383eb99e7b6b3031b71b5fc","title":"ahead of the curve an eco home by the sea in new zealand","story":"An architect’s striking home in a dome on the New Zealand coast is as visually interesting as it is groundbreakingThere is an unusual sight to be found in the small hamlet of Peka Peka, on the windswept west coast of New Zealand’s North Island. At first, it looks like a series of modest hillocks, but on closer inspection some of them have windows and small white towers rise above the landscape like periscopes.Friedrich (“Fritz”) and Helen Eisenhofer’s idiosyncratic dwelling lies beneath the grass of these knolls it is a prototype domestic biodome for what Fritz, a modernist architect who was trained at the Kunstakademie in Vienna, has called the Eco Home. Fritz travelled from Austria to the Pacific in 1953 to begin a career there that now s more than half a century.The couple’s work on their shared home began in the late 1980s. While they chose the site for its proximity to the sea, another major factor was that, being among the sand dunes, the terrain lent itself to their dream of creating an earth-sheltered, low-cost, energy-efficient house.The building is a series of sun-facing, faceted domes designed to store heat and conserve energy. Each was constructed with a thin shell of robust ferro-cement that contains the iron foundation that forms the skeleton of the structure.The main dome, which covers the living area and – more unusually – an indoor swimming pool, is half submerged in the earth to a depth of 4m.A closer look reveals two large glass panels, one facing north towards the southern hemisphere’s midday sun, and another facing west to trap the sunlight’s passive heat.“Over the years, I’ve studied energy conservation and underground development around the world,” says Fritz. “It’s a unique way of building and has very low material costs.”Energy-efficient techniques of generating solar gain are common to many passive or sustainably designed buildings, and they have always been a key feature of Fritz’s architectural exploration.However, he took it a step further in his own house, creating a system he describes as a “rock store” containing tonnes of river stones placed under and around the building as both insulation and a heat trap.The rocks collect heat on warm days and then slowly release it, regulating the temperature inside the house. The system is complemented with rooftop solar panels that provide the two residents’ basic electricity requirements.“The heat exchange from the rocks tends to be very slow,” says Fritz. “Day to day, we don’t need to heat the dome at all, so our electricity requirements are extremely minimal.”The circular front door repeats the house’s dominant visual element and leads directly into the soaring, open-plan main dome. The all-white, jungle-filled interior has a warm microclimate, while the living areas on the ground floor are all oriented in relation to the indoor swimming pool, an unusual central feature that creates an ever-shifting interplay of light, water and foliage.Fritz has created pools inside many of his projects, and the couple have had one in every house they’ve lived in. As the weather is highly temperamental on the Pacific coast, and winters can be blustery and cold, the couple rarely swim in the sea. The ozone-treated pool, however, can be used in any season.Higher than usual humidity levels are one downside of this otherwise happy arrangement, says Helen. However, the glass wall was designed to extend to the base of the dome, so any condensation drains into the garden.“It’s also very calming sitting at the dining table seeing the reflection of the water dancing on the ceiling. It’s something to wake up to every day,” she adds.The couple chose plants that are known to be effective at cleansing the air, including peace lilies, banana palms, ferns and palm trees.“Over the years, we’ve tried different things,” says Helen. “It’s been a system of trial and error, but we’ve discovered peace lilies are best as they’re not affected by humidity – and they’re a lovely white or red, so they make beautiful indoor displays.”As the curved interior walls aren’t suited to traditional furniture, the leather seating throughout the house was custom-made by the Auckland-based firm UFL to Fritz’s specifications. He then designed and hand-built the dining and coffee tables using recycled and repurposed materials.The exceptions to this are the Eero Saarinen Tulip dining chairs, and the hardy Corian work surface in the kitchen. “We’ve had the Corian for 20 years and it’s fantastic,” says Helen. “It still looks new and it’s not too cold to the touch.”Fritz planned the compact, U-shaped kitchen to be simple yet efficient. Divided from the dining room by a breakfast bar, inside the kitchen cooking is arranged on one side, and the fridge on the other, connected with worktops to either side of the sink bench in the middle for economy of movement.The mezzanine level above holds Fritz’s studio, the couple’s bedroom and a bathroom. Also, two steps up from the bedroom, is a second living area that can be ided off from the main space with a vertical blind. It has views out over the sea towards Kapiti Island, a nature reserve that sits just off the coastline.“I think the best part of living in such an unusual dwelling is the huge open space we are lucky to spend most of our time in,” says Helen. “In fact, I now find smaller rooms slightly confining. The other key factor is the peace and tranquillity, as so little noise comes into the dome from outside. Playing music is a joy because the whole space fills with sound like a bandshell. After so many years living here I would find it difficult to live in a conventional house.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9015f74b1c85e27965a725ecff607049b0d55655/0_0_4967_2981/master/4967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=667dbf7566f7595ab9e4898784f63a08","title":"family cooking under coronavirus ive become a chef with two grumpy regular customers","story":"Cooking and clearing up has been relentless – and that’s without adding a special birthday cake to my range of signature dishesI’m sitting down to write this having just cleaned fox poo out of the tiny grooves in the soles of my four-year-old’s sandals. She also, somehow, smeared it all over her legs, her dress, my legs, my shorts. The only plus I can take from it is that, for once in our crowded corner of south London, social distancing was not an issue.Cooking for your children can be a dispiriting experience. There’s often a magical window when they are around two, where they eat all sorts of exotic things: green vegetables, non-white food generally, Italian dishes that don’t begin with “p”. But gradually, imperceptibly, I have found my kids becoming entrenched in their tastes, suspicious of the unfamiliar. I’m not talking about olives and kimchi just getting them to eat some courgette involves agreeing to a Peppa Pig all-nighter in return.Not long ago, but BC (before coronavirus), I was moaning to a colleague about it, a serious home cook, a tweezers-and-soda-siphon guy. Also, his children are older, teenagers. I wanted to know if it got any easier. “You have to think of it like being a line cook,” he replied, years of pain in his voice. Your job is not to be showy. It’s to do your bit and get the job done: to make peace with cooking the same meal again and again. Innovation or experimentation were neither expected nor required from your customers (that is, your offspring).I have thought about this conversation from time to time after coronavirus took hold, and especially since the schools closed in March, when two major changes became apparent. First, demand: I went from having to supply my children not with two meals a day, but three, plus morning and afternoon snacks (though they helpfully remind me of snack-time by growing fangs and clawing at the fridge, without fail, at 11am and 3pm). The other disruption was supply. Just before we realised how serious the pandemic was, my girlfriend and I raised our eyebrows at friends who went to Asda at 7am on a Sunday morning to stock up. Within days, we were flooded with images of whole aisles of supermarkets cleared out. Toilet roll went first, then pasta, rice, flour, tinned tomatoes. You know all this.The experience of seeing this unfold did, I understand looking back, send me a bit mad. It’s a cliché (most things about parenthood are) but when you have children it’s hard not to become convinced that your main responsibility now – perhaps the only thing that really matters – is to keep them alive and well. Coronavirus may have made this more real and present than usual for me, but in truth it’s hardwired. I’m happier when my kids have eaten well, secure in the knowledge that whatever else I’m getting wrong, that part I’m not screwing up.I didn’t stockpile or panic buy – not particularly for moral reasons but, in part, because we’ve only got a small freezer and limited shelf space. But I did find myself checking the websites of online shopping companies obsessively: first thing in the morning, my last act before bed, and some days a dozen times in between. I should add here that the online food suppliers and their delivery drivers have done an incredible job of reorganising their systems and keeping things as smooth as they could. My children will never know, or appreciate, how close they came to two days in a row without bananas.Many days, cooking and clearing up after the kids has felt like a full-time job (actually worse: it starts at 7am, goes on till past 10pm, and you don’t get half an hour to mull over the perfect phrasing of an email). It is exhausting, relentless and relentlessly thankless, as any parent without additional childcare in the normal run of things already knows well. I’ve been, frankly, astonished at my kids’ inability to sit at a table for longer than 4.5 seconds without breaking out into song, or wrestling each other, or nipping to their bedroom to get something “very important” like a small piece of string, or a plastic fish, or a Sylvanian Families Halloween slide set (don’t ask). In order to speed up the four-year-old’s eating, my girlfriend has invented a game in which she pretends to be a toothbrush (from Texas, I think) who wants nothing more than to “stop” our daughter having any more dinner (full rules available on request), which is ultimately very effective but also makes me want to jump out of the window.But as time goes on, I’ve started to make my peace with the situation. Accepting my role as, in Bill Buford’s words, a kitchen slave, I listen more to what my kids want to eat, rather than bending them to my will. Feeling consulted, they seem to become more open to trying things. Some dinners have been disasters – an attempt to pitch aubergine parmigiana as “pizza without the crust” didn’t fly – but the next morning they just eat a double breakfast. And it’s made me more resourceful: we found a huge patch of wild garlic in a nearby wood, and the kids just about tolerated the pesto we made with it. I dug out various packets of dried pulses from the back of the cupboard, one of which had a best-before date of 2015 and I could only cook by putting instructions through Google Translate, but which were, nonetheless, delicious.On the radio, I heard someone compare life during coronavirus to being on a cruise ship: the three meals provided a structure to a day that otherwise might be disconcertingly free and unhinged. As the weeks became a month, we’ve tried to differentiate the days, or at least the weekends. Sunday night is dress-up dinner night: we do it not to be la-di-da so much as to ensure that our tracksuit bottoms don’t wear out from overuse. Baking kills time and we do some of that: banana bread, soda bread, lots of biscuits. The kids are interested for around a minute and a half, drift off, and return to lick the spoons. I haven’t made sourdough, unlike everyone else on social media apparently, mainly because it’s too much of a faff, but also because I haven’t got over my Electra complex of killing my “mother” back in 2017.If there’s been a focal point so far, it was my eldest daughter’s seventh birthday, which fell on Easter Sunday. Obviously there’d be no party, no friends, fewer presents, but I could still make her a cake. When I asked her what kind, she requested “mint choc chip” with “marshmallows”, which sounded totally disgusting, but which turned out – by some miracle or misfortune – to match the exact description of grasshopper pie, from Christina Tosi’s Momofuku Milk Bar cookbook. It’s a book I’ve never previously cooked from, because every recipe contains so many sections that even reading it is exhausting, but if ever there were a time when you conceivably could spend three days baking it was now. (Plus it only required 40g of flour, which was all we had.)At 3pm on my daughter’s birthday, we lit seven candles and brought it out. Watching her eating her brown, sludgy dream-cake seemed to put her gag reflex well and truly to the test, but she made polite noises, ate a slice, and we put the rest in the freezer, where we will probably rediscover it in 10 years’ time.Of course, the cake didn’t really matter. It was just one of hundreds of meals we will make during this strange period. Many people are asking themselves how their lives will change after lockdown. I hope I will be more relaxed about cooking for myself and others, appreciative of and resourceful with what we have. As for cooking the same meals over and over again, I’ve decided that I’m not going to think of myself as a line cook. Instead, I’m recasting myself as a chef with a small range of signature dishes – macaroni cheese, pizza, fish fingers – and a couple of grumpy regulars who are, nonetheless, fiercely loyal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113870c4ca5e9f46f518c8f7c43ae6d349f6a498/0_1575_1869_1120/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b98ce6f39769f5007129a925cfd8710","title":"would you dare to dye your partners hair ","story":"As grey roots appear, imagine the plight of a wary partner asked to stand in for the experts… A cautionary taleRecently, my wife has started walking towards me and bowing her head, as if in penitence.

But I care about my wife, and she cares about her hair a great deal indeed, so I get all tangled up in it, like a cheap brush in an amateur blow-dry.You may have the same thing going on, if not about hair then about something else. Because in every pair of human beings there is always a tiny difference of opinion that feels like a Grand Canyon. One can’t understand why the other cares so little, and the other thinks the first is obsessed.When I told her I would be writing this article about her hair, my wife said: “OK. Just don’t make me seem too neurotic.” What follows is an attempt to describe somebody just neurotic enough:1. Soon after we first met, she stayed away from me for a whole month, because she felt that she had been given a bad haircut and didn’t want to put me off.2. When our daughter was a baby, old enough to sit up in the bath but not yet speaking, I gave her (the daughter) a cheeky little trim. Alas, this occasioned wailing and gnashing of teeth from my wife, and I was not quickly forgiven.3. I did once try to blow-dry her hair, and did get my cheap brush tangled in her fringe. This time it wasn’t wailing but howling.These painful memories have been flushed into the foreground by beastly lockdown. With every day that passes, her grey roots become more visible. Until now, this has been managed by the clever application of something contained in an expensive-looking box that she keeps in the cupboard in the downstairs loo. But at some point this remedy will cease to work. And then…I have been informed that I will be required to colour my wife’s hair, using some kind of kit she has acquired in the post and following instructions not merely pre-recorded on YouTube but administered live and in real-time by an actual, pro hair colourist (but what did you expect, given 1, 2 and 3 above?)Speaking entirely in the abstract, this kind of challenge appeals strongly to me. I like painting: I paint in oils, acrylic and watercolour. I am currently painting undercoat and emulsion, in that same downstairs loo, with both brush and roller. If somebody presented me with a wig on a stand, a brush and hair colour, I’d fly at it.But my wife is not a wig on a stand. She’s somebody I care about, with high standards and strong views.When she first suggested I colour her hair along the lines described above, I proposed that she might instead ask for assistance from our daughter, now a teenager with a lively interest in hair and makeup. I overheard them conversing in the bathroom with the door open. It started well: daughter leapt at the chance, telling mother she’d love to do it.Unfortunately, mother didn’t stop speaking. Instead, she launched into a speech – a speech that promised to run as long as that Vogue article – about the need for daughter to get it exactly right. The kind of pressure you might put on somebody before brain surgery.Daughter interrupted: “Actually, no. I’m not doing it. Ask Dad.”I’m so pleased to have a daughter who knows how to set boundaries, and say no. I just wish it didn’t put me back in the spotlight. The options, as I see it, are these:a. Encourage my wife to go grey. (Won’t happen. The grey is patchy, won’t look right, she says.)b. Pray that British hair salons are permitted, like those in the American state of Georgia, as described in Vogue, to let customers in again before it’s too late. (Can’t see it happening soon.)c. Do it, make a hash of it, take my bollocking. (Not the end of the world, but a painful experience that I’d rather avoid.)d. Do it, find I am not bad at it, win enduring praise and affection. (Ha!)e. Procrastinate until she becomes desperate enough to say she won’t mind if I make a mess of it. (Best shot.)This is not really a story about hair, which many consider to be trivial. It’s about control, responsibility and taking care of each other. Human beings need to feel at least a bit in control, responsible and looked after. By depriving her of access to John Frieda, lockdown has stripped away the illusion that my wife can control the unwanted appearance of grey hair.Compared with much else that is going on – people dying, losing jobs – this is certainly at the trivial end of how losing control makes us uncomfortable. But, as it happens, I don’t think hairdos are trivial. It’s true that, in order to avoid pointless conversation at the barber’s, I sometimes sit through the entire procedure with my eyes closed. (If it’s a good cut, great. If it’s a bad one, so what? It will soon grow out.) And yet… a few years ago when a thin patch appeared at the top of my head I found it painful to contemplate. The uncertainty was terrible: was I about to go entirely bald? Would I lose it all? How long would it take: years, months, days? Would it fall out overnight? What would people think? Why was my body undermining me like this?Over time, I came to see that I regularly meet people I know whose hair has grown bushy, fallen out or changed colour and that, after registering the change, I tend not to give it a second thought. Why should anybody care any more about my hair? I’m sure they don’t. By extension, I’m sure most people couldn’t care less if my wife’s grey roots are visible. If they do care, they’re not worth bothering about, surely?You can imagine how well this line of reasoning works on her – not at all.The other day, we were watching the news presented by a journalist friend. I told my wife I knew him. She said, “Send him a message.” I did. It read: “My wife wants to know if you TV people have access to secret grooming and haircuts…”Part of me felt sure he wouldn’t reply to such trivia. But the answer flew back fast. “Sadly not! The makeup artists have been sent home and the women are in fear of their real hair colour coming through.”And it’s not just the women who want to get their hair right. He continued: “Just before lockdown I eschewed filling up the fridge for an emergency haircut. Priorities are important right now.”And so we carry on.My wife bows her head for inspection, invites me to watch somebody on Instagram who just dyed their own hair successfully, or spectacularly badly. And, for most of the time, I pretend to be interested. I’m sure that, in some part of my lockdown life that holds no interest for her, she is doing the same for me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62fc3347def3843ff69f1f50b31698a322af379d/0_277_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb7d481990eec9f8b8dd30b0657abb2","title":"firms slash entry level jobs by almost quarter owing to coronavirus pandemic young people","story":"Report reflects concerns that pandemic will hit job prospects of young people hardestSchool leavers and graduates hoping to enter the labour market in Britain this year will struggle to find employment as firms slash entry-level jobs by nearly a quarter owing to the coronavirus crisis, a report warns.The latest findings appear to reflect concerns that the pandemic is likely to hit the job prospects of young people the hardest.Stephen Isherwood, the chief executive of the ISE, said: “There is no denying that this will be a challenging year for young people entering the labour market. “Some employers are backing graduates over non-graduates and others have found it too difficult to start new apprenticeships, which means that school leavers will be among the hardest hit by the crisis.“This doesn’t mean that students should assume the jobs market is dead. Many employers are recruiting and history tells us that we still see unfilled vacancies in a downturn. Switching off is the worst thing students can do. It will only hinder their prospects further when the upturn comes and the jobs market recovers.”Health and pharmaceuticals was found to be the only sector set to increase entry-level recruitment this year while the built environment, finance, professional services, energy and engineering were making the biggest cuts.Some of the UK’s biggest employers have already cancelled or delayed recruitment schemes and internships.

Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘Track and Trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app,” the emails said.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, and recruitment for both the online and phone-based contact-tracing service was continuing “at pace”.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “Test, trace and isolate is fundamental to managing and controlling this virus and safely easing lockdown – yet the government’s approach has been increasingly chaotic, with misstep after misstep.”The government is battling to maintain public trust for the difficult second phase of managing the crisis after replacing the blunt “stay at home, save lives” message with the more nebulous “stay alert”.Boris Johnson acknowledged on Sunday he could understand the public’s frustration. He wrote in the Mail on Sunday: “I recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home – but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people.”The NHS’s digital arm, NHSX, has developed its own coronavirus tracking app, which will hold data centrally, instead of opting for an alternative from Google and Apple that operates in a decentralised way.If a user becomes unwell with symptoms of Covid-19, they can choose to let the app inform the NHS. They will be offered testing, and an anonymous alert will inform other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days.Thousands of contact tracers, many of them working from home, will work alongside the app, speaking to Covid-19 sufferers about whom they may have been in contact with, and giving advice – for example, urging them to self-isolate.Ministers want to be able to use the data gathered to analyse the spread of the virus. They hope this will allow them to reimpose lockdown conditions in local areas where a new outbreak is detected – a process Johnson has described as “whack-a-mole”.But the app is working against constraints in modern smartphones that only Google and Apple can work around, as well as arriving burdened with privacy concerns that could deter some members of the public from using it.People who had applied for contact-tracing jobs through the government’s gov.uk website were told this weekend: “As and when the app (or an alternative) goes live, we will reconsider those applications already received, however please be aware that we have received an unprecedented number of applications for this role and therefore not all suitable candidates will be able to be put forward.”The DHSC spokesperson said: “The NHS contact-tracing app is not on hold and it would be completely wrong to suggest otherwise. There is no alternative app and the NHS continues to work constructively with many other organisations that are helping to develop and test the NHS Covid-19 app.” revealed last week that the app’s advisory board was split over whether it had the authority to tell the government to ditch its version and switch to the Apple and Google version.After a meeting on Thursday, it emerged that members argued their role on the board was limited to providing guidance on ethical questions, and not to branch out into a broader discussion of whether the app is the right tool for the job.Some government officials believe the NHSX app may not survive in its current form after trials on the Isle of Wight. Software for a decentralised version by Apple and Google is expected to be released on Tuesday.The government gave up trying to track every UK case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said at the time: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.”But Ashworth and the health secretary Matt Hancock’s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, have repeatedly called for community tracing.If the track and trace system is ready to roll out by the end of month, it would be in time to provide reassurance to parents and teachers that inidual cases in English schools could be identified and isolated if they reopen to more pupils from 1 June, as the government is demanding.The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 contact tracers of the 18,000 promised by Hancock had been hired, but government sources now say that number was out of date.Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on SkyNews, Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. “We’re on course to meet that target. It’s more evidence that we have, in Matt, an energetic and determined health secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against this virus,” Gove said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3f49ee596cbb8a2cab7cffe566852ddf5ea524/0_246_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a4800f9a4c3375bc92f9e94c0ca7dd31","title":"whod be a health secretary five former incumbents on the toughest gig in politics","story":"With Matt Hancock under fire, former health secretaries discuss their highs and lows, how they dealt with pandemics – and what the future holdsOne effect of the unprecedented socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 has been to catapult the secretary of state for health and social care to the forefront of British politics. For the long month of April, with the prime minister either in intensive care with the disease or recuperating in isolation, there was no one with a more prominent government profile than Matt Hancock.It was, to say the least, an unusual predicament for a health secretary. Since the controversy around the target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests and Boris Johnson’s return to work, Hancock has taken a small step back from the limelight. But if, in the final analysis, he is adjudged to have had a good pandemic, he could well be seen as a leader in waiting.On the other hand, if the UK’s death count ends up the highest in Europe, as it currently stands, and the reports continue to mount of shortages in protective clothing and problems with testing and tracing, then history’s equivalent of a surgical waste bin may well await him.Glory or infamy – those are the grand stakes in this unparalleled peacetime civil operation. Yet any halfway ambitious politician would relish the chance to be in Hancock’s shoes right now. And it’s rare that that can be said about the occupant of his office.Come the casino hour of our parliamentary system – the cabinet reshuffle – very few politicians entering No 10 hope to be named health secretary. It’s a post with no visible upside. When anything goes wrong in health, someone usually dies. And things always go wrong. On top of which, the terrain is knee-deep in well-organised interest groups, all demanding more of everything.A widespread wariness about the job was most memorably captured in the response of the pugnacious Labour politician John Reid when appointed in 2003 by Tony Blair. “Oh fuck,” he’s supposed to have said, “not health.”Kenneth Clarke, who was health secretary in the last couple of years of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, says that over the years he has issued a warning to various successors, both Labour and Conservative: “You’re going to a political graveyard. If you can survive it, then you’re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics.”Clarke describes the role as one of constant bombardment, unrelenting demands to do what others say, ceaseless criticism in the press, from opposition and interest groups, repeated declarations of a crisis and almost universal unpopularity, including among your cabinet colleagues. It sounds, I say, like the job from hell.“I thought it was just immense fun,” says Clarke.As a belligerent spirit was the signature style of the first modern health secretary, Aneurin Bevan, perhaps it should be no surprise that, like ministerial red boxes, it has become part of the job description. The machismo might explain why the health ministry has been largely a male preserve. There have only been three female health secretaries, beginning in 1974 with Barbara Castle, who, it must be said, was no shrinking violet. (Virginia Bottomley and Patricia Hewitt were approached for this piece, but both declined to speak.)Although there has been some kind of minister for health dating back to the mid-19th century, it was not until a hundred years later, and the arrival in 1945 of Bevan, that the role we recognise today first took shape. A former miner who left school at 13, Bevan was a renowned political bruiser who drove through the National Health Service Act with unyielding determination.He had to overcome opposition from his own Labour benches as well as from within the Conservative party and the British Medical Association (BMA), whose members disparaged him as the “Tito of Tonypandy”. But facing down his opponents, Bevan created a free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service for all, one that opened its doors on 5 July 1948. By the time he died 12 years after the NHS’s birth, Bevan had become a national hero.That can’t be said of any of his often unloved successors, although each of them has played a part in developing an NHS that has grown far beyond what Bevan envisaged.“The budget was £200m the year Nye Bevan introduced the NHS,” says Alan Johnson, health secretary under Gordon Brown. “It was £110 bn when I left the job.”It is currently £140bn. Even accounting for inflation, that’s an extraordinary increase yet whatever the figure, it’s never enough. The NHS is the fifth-largest employer in the world. It’s a gargantuan operation that necessarily contains large inefficiencies and daunting shortages. But we pay less per head of population for our health system than any other major western nation.That’s one reason the NHS is perennially viewed as underfunded – even though health is about the only government department whose budget has never been cut. Nearly all governments are accused of shortchanging the NHS, but in particular Conservatives, who have traditionally been seen as, at best, reluctant supporters of the NHS, and more often as would-be privatisers.All the Conservative former health secretaries I spoke to think this accusation is unfair and inaccurate, and bemoan the fact that they had to spend rather too much time in office contesting a falsehood. Nonetheless, Margaret Thatcher was once keen to see the UK adopt a US-style private insurance-funded health service. And from time to time, a Conservative thinktank or backbench ideologue will revisit the proposal, to keep the dream alive.Fowler, who served as health secretary for six years under Thatcher, accepts these points. “But,” he protests, “the significant thing is that those ideas have never got anywhere. And if they didn’t get anywhere under Margaret Thatcher, they’re not likely to get anywhere under any other prime minister.”Matt Hancock’s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, complains that whatever he did in the job, he always faced the same charge of having a secret agenda.“I was accused of starving the NHS of funds as a way of persuading the public that the only option was privatisation,” he says. “I then secured a £20bn rise in budget and the very same people said on Twitter: ‘Ah, he’s fattening the NHS up for privatisation.’”In fact, Conservative spending on health was limited for most of Hunt’s time in office and during that of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, at least by comparison with the boom times of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In large part this was due to the austerity measures that the Coalition and Conservative governments imposed, following the 2008 financial crisis.Some critics have suggested that the shortfall in protective clothing for NHS staff witnessed in this pandemic is in part a legacy of underfunding during Hunt’s tenure. “I felt throughout my time as health secretary that it did need more resources,” Hunt concedes. “There is more you can do on efficiency, but in the end only so much, and it needed more resources.”In 2016, while Hunt was still in office, Exercise Cygnus was conducted to test how the UK would respond to a pandemic. According to leaked sections of the report, which has never been published, it was found that the country was not ready to cope, particularly in the area of social care.Hunt still maintains that austerity was the right policy to put the economy back on its feet, but he adds: “I don’t want to minimise the fact that this was a very tough period for the NHS.”One fan of Hunt’s work on the health select committee is Alan Johnson. “I think he’s doing a great job as chair,” he says, which is probably not the verdict he would give on Hunt’s time in office. Like Hunt, Johnson emphasises the drive to improve patient care as his biggest motivating factor when he was health secretary. He therefore had little time for those who perceived any outsourcing of services as backdoor privatisation. “You talk to people on the left and the job of the NHS is to employ public service workers,” he says, shaking his head in our FaceTime call. “Not to improve disgraceful waiting times.”For all his modernising zeal, Johnson says the NHS’s greatest strength is its old-fashioned social solidarity, a quality, be argues, that Conservatives don’t really understand. “It’s against all the philosophy they’ve imbibed.” The irony, then, is that social solidarity has never been more loudly promoted among Tories than by this current government. The NHS has been rebranded “Our NHS”, its workers hailed as national heroes, invoked at every turn by politicians and applauded every Thursday evening by the public. Although the form of expression is new, the sentiment is not. The NHS invariably features at the top of the list of institutions of which Britons feel most proud. The problem for health secretaries is that this national pride can manifest as an over-protectiveness – “Hands off the NHS” – that leaves them limited room for manoeuvre.As such, they often find themselves caught between contradictory instructions: improve the service and leave it alone. Fowler knows the syndrome well. “Put it this way,” he says, “one of the most serious bursts of applause I’ve ever had was when I was introduced at a conference of medical experts as the only secretary of state who didn’t try to reorganise the health service.”Clarke is less familiar with that kind of resounding applause. He embarked on a major overhaul of management, creating an internal market inspired in part, he says, by a need to head off Thatcher’s more radical proposals. It led to a series of massive rows between the prime minister and her health secretary. “Someone once told me we had 14 meetings about it,” he says, both amazed and amused by the number. “She was even more combative than I am. It was basically a bureaucratic shambles,” he says of the service he set about reforming, “as there was no proper management or control of the system.”In spite of his own restructuring of the NHS, which he says has stood the test of time because no one has reversed it, Clarke doesn’t think constant organisational reform is a good thing. “That must sound off coming from me. But you can’t have every secretary of state going in for an upheaval like that.”In a highly competitive field, perhaps the greatest upheaval was wrought by Andrew Lansley, David Cameron’s first health secretary. He is the exemplar of a longstanding NHS paradox – decentralisation from above. The more he argued for local empowerment, the more he micromanaged the transition, bolstering GPs, creating Public Health England, abolishing primary care trusts and much else besides. The consensus among his fellow health secretaries is that the reforms were misjudged, confusing and unnecessary.If reorganisational exhaustion in the wake of Lansley dampened the appetite for re-envisioning the NHS, Covid-19 has removed it from the agenda for the foreseeable future. For all its terrible toll of death and devastation, a major pandemic is a clarifying experience. Suddenly, discussions about rationalising regional management structures are beside the point. There is instead a unity of purpose and a galvanising sense of clear battle lines. It’s no coincidence that the most common political metaphors employed in the Covid-19 debate are military ones. Just as every defence secretary works to avoid war, but only really comes into his or her own when war breaks out, no health secretary wants a pandemic, and yet it’s their career-defining moment.If Fowler is remembered by some clinicians for his executive light touch, he is better known for his performance during the Aids crisis in the mid-1980s. It’s easy to forget, amid the relentless news coverage of Covid-19, but HIV was a killer virus for which there was no treatment when it first came to light. It has since killed tens of millions around the world, though in the UK today, HIV is seldom fatal. Initially, it sparked enormous fear and stigmatisation, particularly of the gay community, which suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. But it was a period that Fowler looks back on with most professional and political satisfaction. “The whole health service worked together no question, no arguments,” he says. “And when it acts together it really is a wonderful service.”There is also another feature of pandemics that can bring the best out in politicians. As few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds, they usually find themselves deferring to clinical expertise. This is especially true in a pandemic. The difference is that the art of communication – the politician’s area of expertise – also becomes increasingly important. In Fowler’s case, he had the job of informing the public and reforming its behaviour – primarily, encouraging the use of condoms. Hence the government’s bold advertising campaign “Don’t Die of Ignorance”, which grabbed the nation’s anxious attention in 1987.He also had to do battle with Thatcher, and some of his cabinet colleagues, who were either squeamish or positively damning about issues of gay sexual practice and intravenous drug use – the main conduits of HIV transmission in this country.“I got totally frustrated in 1986,” he recalls. “It was a national crisis and I didn’t think we were making the progress we should be making in a national crisis. I remember being asked: ‘Do we have to have this section on risky sex?’ The whole point of the advertisement was to explain to people why they should avoid what they called risky sex!”Given the prime ministerial scrutiny he was under, I ask him whether it’s at all liberating for a health secretary if your boss is, as Johnson recently was, out of commission. “I never had that luxury,” he laments. “Theoretically, it’s not an ideal circumstance.”Fowler is not the only health secretary in living memory who faced a pandemic in office.“I was three days into the job when a global pandemic was declared with swine flu,” says Burnham, adding as a humorous aside: “As he exited the door, Mr Alan Johnson proved again that he’s a master of political timing.” Interestingly, Johnson recalls the pandemic as something that happened on his shift. “What took up most of my time?” he asks. “Well, there was the pandemic, of course.”In the event, regardless of who was in the hot seat, the H1N1 swine flu was not nearly as life-threatening as first feared. Some critics consequently suggested that the Labour government and the two health secretaries overreacted. But both men highlight the fact that a pandemic was top of the government risk register and they were well prepared to deal with it. Just as a flawed or under-resourced plan can leave a health secretary on the defensive, the more successful a strategy is, the less people get to see how bad things might have been. In a political sense it’s a lose-lose situation. “It was kind of a fraught terrain in those early days of swine flu,” remembers Burnham. “I made mistakes wrestling with these issues and sometimes came down on the wrong side.” He regrets putting the worst-case scenario statistics in the public domain – 60,000 deaths were predicted at the upper end, but there were actually fewer than 500. He also recalls a “car crash” TV interview with Andrew Castle, whose daughter had had a seriously adverse reaction to Tamiflu, the prophylactic issued to children. “I came away thinking, I’m not the person to be defending Tamiflu on national television,” he says.His advice for Hancock is to resist the temptation to front the message too much on TV. Hunt, however, has only praise for what he says has been a strong communications campaign with a clear message – we spoke before the much-criticised change from “stay home” to “stay alert”. That said, he believes a longer-term strategy should be clearly outlined. “People need to understand how we’re going to exit the current situation.”Clarke picks out Hancock as a good performer among some less impressive government ministers, but he offers a word of caution directly to the young health secretary. “My advice to you will be, don’t start giving forecasts when we’re dealing with a total unknown here, and don’t start making forecasts on testing.”Several of the former health secretaries thought that Hancock made himself a hostage to fortune with his promise of reaching 100,000 coronavirus tests by the end of April. But all agree that it won’t be until an inquiry is held after the crisis has passed that any worthwhile or lasting judgments can be made on the government’s and Hancock’s handling of the pandemic. In the meantime, Burnham thinks the best thing to come out of the crisis is that the NHS will no longer be under any kind of existential threat, real or imagined. “Nobody will privatise it now nobody will introduce different funding models. It’s finally entered into that sort of sacred space.” He argues that social care provision should be folded into the NHS. While he’s long supported this option, he says the case is irrefutable now the limitations of the social care system have been thoroughly exposed by Covid-19. “How can someone who is so essential that they are caring for another human being not be paid the living wage?” he asks. “It’s shameful.”There seems little doubt that social care is the neglected side of the portfolio in the Department of Health and Social Care, the unloved child forever in the shadow of its revered sibling. It would amount to a massive undertaking and significant investment to bring social care under the NHS umbrella. Whether or not it’s something Hancock will consider, it’s hard to believe that what Johnson calls the “scandalous crisis in adult social care” can be allowed to continue after the viral dust has settled.There have been no shortage of predictions – some wildly optimistic, others darkly ominous – about the post-Covid-19 world. The first task, obviously, is to make it a post-Covid-19 world, and in that endeavour the health secretary has a vital role to play. It’s far too early to know what the outcome will look like, or when it will arrive, but perhaps we can tentatively suggest that in the next cabinet reshuffle the word on the health job won’t be a four-letter one.Key issue  How to mount an Aids public awareness campaign.Most satisfying aspect of the job? “It goes back to Aids again. With something like the virus, you know more than your medical experts about how to communicate to the public.”Greatest strength of the NHS? “It’s an institution that is valued and recognised by the vast majority of the public.”Greatest weakness? “It tends to be a bit of a political football.”Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “You could make a very strong case for looking at all this again, particularly with nurses, who have been working, at times, at peril.”Key issue How to reform the NHS without adopting an American system.Advice he was given? “You’ve got to find a concession to give the BMA at least once a year.”His own advice? “The aim of any decent department minister is to get the prime minister to take as little interest in the subject as possible.”Most satisfying aspect of the job? “Knowing that you’re trying to make a difference to something that is vitally important – the wellbeing of the country.”Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “Yes, though it’s gone up and down over the years. They’re much better paid now than they were in my time.”Key issue “We had a bad deal with the drug companies that was supposed to last for six years. I pulled it and went through the whole process again to get a better deal on drugs.”Most satisfying aspect of the job? “The feeling that you were in a small way part of something so crucial to people’s lives. That was a privilege.”On Matt Hancock’s performance: “I’m not really impressed. I don’t think Matt Hancock’s as good as he thinks he is.”Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? “By the time we left office they were a lot more adequately rewarded than they had been. But it’s slipped back again so no, I don’t think they’re adequately rewarded.”Key issue Organising the response to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic.Most satisfying aspect of the job? “There was an independent review that said the response to the swine flu was highly satisfactory.”What did you find difficult about the job? “I inherited stuff I never felt comfortable with. I would point to the use of the private sector. I was never an advocate of that.”Do you have sympathy for Matt Hancock? “I thought it was awful when one of the newspapers had a Number 10 briefing against him. That was a cruel moment. I think he needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. It’s a tough gig and he’s made some obvious mistakes, but given the severity of what he’s been dealing with, he’s not doing badly.”Key issue The imposition of new contracts for junior doctors which led to prolonged strike action.Most satisfying aspect of the job? “My greatest satisfaction was in some of the interactions I had with patients and families who had really suffered badly as a result of something going wrong. They were people actually who kept me going for nearly six years.”Biggest surprise? “I found out that 150 people a week die in the NHS because of errors in their medical treatment. I was gobsmacked by that. Then I discovered this was actually true all over the world this is what happens in medicine.”Have you ever been interested in privatising the NHS? “I’ve always been a passionate believer in the NHS. There’s something about what the NHS stands for which speaks to the best of British values.”Do you think this pandemic calls for the help of former health secretaries? “I think there’s a role for people outside politics to come in in moments of national crisis. There are times when you need people who can – to use that horrible business phrase – JFDI things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d9ede6589c0e55a08625bd4e1e9e1131f33e9f8/0_280_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=180312ff7de76d532ee31431a5c4143e","title":"rare long necked dinosaur that roamed the polar world unearthed in australia","story":"Discovery of a single vertebra of an elaphrosaur in Victoria hugely expands known range of the group, which had teeth as juveniles but beaks as adults A dinosaur relative of T. rex and Velociraptor with an unusually long neck, and which may have transitioned from predator to plant-eater as it reached adulthood, has been unearthed in Victoria.The elaphrosaur was a member of the theropod family of dinosaurs that included all of the predatory species. It stood about the height of a small emu, measuring 2m from its head to the end of a long tail, and had short arms, each ending in four fingers.Stephen Poropat, the lead researcher behind the find, at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, said elaphrosaurs were “really rare,” with just three named species from Tanzania, China and Argentina. “This is the first record of the group in Australia, and only the second Cretaceous record worldwide.”“These are some of the most puzzling theropod dinosaurs, as they are known from such few fossils,” said Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research. “They seem to have been lightly built, fast-running, long-necked theropods which traded the carnivorous diet of their ancestors and become omnivores.”Revealed in the journal Gondwana Research, the fossil – which consists of a single vertebra – was discovered in 2015 at a dig site called Eric the Red West near Cape Otway, about three hours’ drive south-west of Melbourne.Rather than the typical desert environments where fossils are often found, digs here led by the Melbourne Museum extract fossils from immense hard grey slabs of rock along the coastline, which are frequently inundated with seawater. “One of the unusual things about this site is that the first hour or two on a dig here is spent shovelling wet sand,” said Swinburne University PhD student Adele Pentland, a co-author of the study.Found by a volunteer participant in the dig, Jessica Parker, the unusual 5cm-long vertebra ended up in the collection of the Melbourne Museum. Based on the elongate shape of the delicate bone, it was first thought to have been from a flying pterosaur, rather than a dinosaur.It was only several years later, when Pentland came to study the bone as part of her research on Australian pterosaurs, that the researchers realised it was something else entirely.“So we went back to square one and started going through textbooks, trying to work out what kind of vertebra it was,” Poropat said. After establishing that the bone was from a theropod, they eventually hit upon an African dinosaur from the Jurassic called Elaphrosaurus, which has neck vertebrae “about four times as long as they are tall, which is unusual for theropods”.“The beauty of this neck vertebra is that it was particularly informative, just because elaphrosaur neck vertebra are so weird compared to other dinosaurs,” Poropat said.While the Australian elaphrosaur is know from just a single bone, its Jurassic-era Chinese relative Limusaurus is know from a whole series of fossil skeletons from babies up to full adults. These show it had the sharp teeth of a predator as a baby, which it lost upon maturity, perhaps transitioning to a diet of mostly plants.Brusatte said the new find was “a great example of how one fossil bone can tell a huge story”.“This discovery greatly expands the range of these animals … They were probably a widespread, and perhaps even global, group of dinosaurs, which we haven’t yet appreciated because of the scanty clues they left behind.”The new find shows they ranged even into southern polar environments.As Australia was much further south 110m years ago, these Victorian dinosaurs would have been living within the Antarctic Circle. While the world was much warmer during the Cretaceous, they would still have had to endure months of darkness during winter and temperatures that periodically dipped below freezing.Nevertheless, other fossils show there was a great ersity of life there. Forests of conifers similar to monkey puzzles and gingko trees had understories carpeted with cycads, ferns and horsetails. Animals included a variety of dinosaurs, as well as turtles, fish and marine reptiles.Further expeditions to the Eric the Red West site have been thwarted twice this year – first by the bushfire crisis and then Covid-19. But Poropat said many fossils awaited excavation and there was a “high chance” there were more elaphrosaur bones to be found.

The Irish Derby, meanwhile, will remain in its traditional slot on the last weekend in June, leaving little chance that horses will be able to line up for both the Irish Derby and the Derby at Epsom, which is provisionally scheduled for 4 July.Like the Irish Derby, the Irish Oaks (18 July) and Irish Champions weekend (12-13 September) also remain on their original dates, while Horse Racing Ireland’s plans to restart the industry after nearly three months of lockdown also include a return of jumps racing on 22 June. This is earlier than envisaged under a previous schedule, which proposed racing only on the Flat for a month after resumption.Runners from abroad will be allowed to contest Irish Group One and Group Two races only during June, but any stable staff travelling with them will be subject to an Irish government rule that anyone arriving in the country by air or sea must self-isolate for two weeks after arrival. This could, for practical purposes, rule out international participation in the Irish Classics, although the government rule does not apply to arrivals from Northern Ireland, which is linked to the British mainland by ferry.All meetings will be run under protocols published on Saturday to prevent the spread of Covid-19, including health screening 24 hours beforehand and on-site temperature checks for all participants and officials before being allowed entry to the course. As racecourse saunas remain out of bounds, the weights for all races will be raised by 2lb.The revised Irish fixture list to the end of June has only one blank day – 16 June – and 28 meetings, including four over jumps. Meetings will have eight races wherever possible, and a general maximum limit of 18 runners per race.“We expect there to be significant demand for horses to run once we resume,” Brian Kavanagh, the chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said, “and we will aim to provide some opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability. We will have missed 11 weeks’ racing, which will take some time to catch up. We intend to do this over the course of the rest of the year, rather than immediately.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2339a7023805b333bb38ddc49704333d9c529662/153_459_2576_1545/master/2576.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=07be37c29f5c9c2a5c0136f0bf973e74","title":"what do we need to talk about review online theatre","story":"Available onlineThe Apple siblings from Richard Nelson’s quartet of plays return on a Zoom call to talk about life in lockdownFor those who know them, the Apple siblings are back again. For initiates, they are three sisters and a brother at the centre of Richard Nelson’s quartet of plays who have previously met at anniversaries and elections to break bread and talk about their lives.This one hour reunion is different in its form, not taking place on stage around a table in Rhinebeck, New York, as it has done before, but in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic on an unspecified day in April when they congregate on a Zoom call to talk about life in lockdown.Filmed live on Zoom by the Public Theater, the off-Broadway venue that debuted all four of Nelson’s Apple family plays between 2010 and 2013, it will doubtless carry more emotional resonance for those who know the characters already, although there is a cumulative force to the drama and it is worth watching for the performances alone.Barbara (Maryann Plunkett), a teacher, has just returned from hospital after being critically ill. Richard (Jay O Sanders), who works for New York governor Andrew Cuomo, has temporarily moved in with her. Jane (Sally Murphy) is a orcee but still lives with her ex-husband, Tim (Stephen Kunken), who is also on the video call and isolating in a separate room and there is Marian (Laila Robins), who is the quietest of them all.They all appear in gallery view and their concerns reflect who they are – white, middle-class Americans in midlife. They talk about the ardour of shopping in a pandemic and the joy of finding their favourite peanut butter still stocked on the shelf. They gripe and moan but are aware of their privilege (“There are so many people who can’t stay at home like us”). They worry about the future of theatre (“People will need to sit together sometime”) and speak of the distrust between the young and old sparked by the crisis.It is familiar fare but the formless flow of conversation achieves a deep sense of intimacy and warmth between them. It is clear that these are five people who know each other inside out and the actors perfect the tics of siblings, from eyeball-rolling irritation to unspoken affection, competition and concern.There is a dramatic shift when Barbara mentions the Decameron, the 14th- century text about storytelling in a time of the Black Death. They begin to tell stories to distract each other from their own 21st-century plague and these vignettes take us beyond the quotidian life that has come before to hold us rapt, from Jane’s discovery of a forgotten female writer’s manuscript to Tim’s revisionist reading of Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. It is a shame when these stories wind back down to small talk.If there is a rub, it comes in the drama’s strength in distilling ordinary life. Much of the conversation feels like our own everyday ruminations, which leaves little distance between the Apples and us, and between drama and reality.But it has a nascent Netflix series feel and it would be easy to become addicted to these sometimes melancholy, sometimes uplifting chunks of American life were Nelson to write his Zoom quartet.• Available to view until 28 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d2343e39782ffa6c5bff86eee3d9d1ffa6f5118/0_0_3154_1894/master/3154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d217083f78edb8c5d4b81b229e70d072","title":"mr theatre the marvellous playhouses of frank matcham in pictures","story":"Commemorating the centenary today of the theatre architect’s death – who is estimated to have built or rebuilt more than 150 theatres including the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and the London Palladium – all existing venues have been asked to post pictures and stories on social media using #Matcham100"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a0e2c116d857025b1ced8ee34bdfd0f20130120/0_211_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cba2b6bdb5262e149b5b8cb21382a781","title":"the big picture a pause during celebrations in 90s bulgaria","story":"Births, marriages and fleeting hopes in times of struggle catch the eye of Witold KrassowskiWitold Krassowski took this photograph of a bride and her bridesmaid at a wedding celebration in Bulgaria in 1991. In his new book, Sackcloth and Ashes, there is a companion picture to this one, which shows the same wedding party parading along a street in Fakulteta, the Roma ghetto in the capital, Sofia. In that picture, the bride picks her way through mud and rubbish, leading a raggedy line of revellers that includes a clarinettist and an accordion player. Here the instruments have been hung up on the shack behind, in a pause in the festivities.Fakulteta is the kind of place Krassowski has been documenting for 30 years. Its 25,000 residents remain cut off from the Bulgarian capital, long denied water and sanitation, and with only off-grid electricity. Many residents are effectively forced to work recycling the industrial waste that is dumped in the area. Krassowski, who first took photographs of his native Poland at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, has subsequently travelled in places as distinct as Tanzania, Peru and Mongolia, but his photographs have a remarkable collective poignancy. He has often been drawn to the universal exclamation marks in human lives – births, marriages and deaths and, as here, to little moments of reflection and hope in lives characterised by hardship and struggle.Speaking of his book, 120 black-and-white silver halide film prints selected from half a lifetime’s work, Krassowski notes how many of his subjects may now be dead and the purpose of the commissions that drove his projects long forgotten. “In the book, however, I hope to keep alive a little longer what unites them: my personal approach, a sense of deep unity beyond cultures. It is important to me that the impact of political events can be understood from the point of view of ordinary people in their ordinary lives.”• Sackcloth and Ashes by Witold Krassowski (GOST Books, £40).

Soldiers and police officers were deployed at the market to take the temperature of all traders and clients.“Markets were probably the biggest vector of infection which is why Peru’s quarantine did not work as it should have,” said Eduardo Zegarra, the principal investigator for Grade, a development thinktank in Lima.“These figures are a bombshell,” he said, calling on the government to shut down the markets and declare a sanitary emergency.Authorities in Lima have left most of the city’s 1,200-plus markets open, carrying out spot tests and sending infected vendors – most of whom were asymptomatic – to self-isolate at home or at government facilities.But Zegarra worried Lima’s huge wholesale markets were already “enormous hubs of infection”, particularly Santa Anita, Lima’s largest, where some 30,000 merchants, porters and suppliers distribute and sell around 8,000 tonnes of food per day.Dozens of infections and at least one death have been reported among the market’s porters and fears were growing that the virus could already have spread not only to thousands of retailers and customers but also to lorry drivers traveling between the city and the country.“I fear that could trigger a second wave of the pandemic,” said Zegarra, a former deputy mayor of Lima. “The contagion among merchants is terribly high and we don’t know how long they’ve had it or how many people they’ve passed it on to.”Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 88,000 on Saturday, with a death toll of 2,572, according to official figures. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, surging to fourth place in the world with 233,511 confirmed cases and sixth place for coronavirus deaths with 15,662, according to Johns Hopkins University.São Paulo’s CEAGESP wholesale market – one of the largest on the continent – has already seen “innumerable” cases and around 30 deaths from Covid-19, according to the president of the market suppliers’ union.“We are very sad about the deaths of these people – but if you consider 40,000 people who come here every day, it is quite low,” said Cláudio Furquim.Media reports have shown crowds of shoppers and workers at Brazilian markets, most them without masks. In a report by TV Record, Diego Hipólito said his uncle, a driver, went to the market daily and kept working when he fell sick with coronavirus symptoms before eventually dying. “I think he could have passed it on,” Hipólito said.Markets still occupy an important place in Latin American culture and economies – even as retail giants such as Walmart expand into the region. But that has also tied them closely to the spread of the disease.Colombia’s largest wholesale market, Corabastos, sits in the hardscrabble Kennedy neighbourhood of the capital Bogotá – currently centre of the country’s outbreak.The city’s health minister, Alejandro Gómez, admitted that local government could have done better but also stressed the importance of food supplies. “We cannot allow Corabastos to become a risk to the health of Bogotá, but neither can we allow food shortages,” he said.Jorge Colmenares, an opposition city councilman, tweeted: “Thanks to Bogota’s carelessness, the coronavirus has hit the food supply of millions of citizens.”At Mexico City’s mammoth Central de Abasto, which receives merchandise from around the country and in turn supplies markets throughout the capital, at least 25 cases of Covid-19 and two deaths have been reported, although local media suggested the true figure was much higher.After a brief lockdown, Mexico has already announced plans to re-open its economy, but while Cornejo was sympathetic with the urge to get back to work, he feared that the worst was still to come from the coronavirus.“Economically, it’s time to restart. But on the health side, I’m worried – I don’t think we’ve hit bottom,” he said.“I’ve lived through the H1N1 outbreak and earthquakes, but I’ve never experienced anything like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf6bf0aebb1690853e1b15748acf90448619d785/0_93_4552_2731/master/4552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d462f9ad2c7c2ebb13265d8c54ab364c","title":"covid 19 cases in brazil surpass italy as virus surges in latin america","story":"Mexico and Peru struggle to contain outbreaks as deaths in Spain fall to two-month lowConfirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy and are surging in Mexico and Peru as Latin America struggles to contain its fast-growing coronavirus outbreak.Spain announced that 87 people had died there in the 24 hours to Sunday morning, the first time the figure has been below 100 in more than two months and a sign the virus is being contained in western Europe as it continues to spread aggressively in Russia, India and parts of Africa.Brazil announced nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday, taking its total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. Its true number of infections is feared to be much greater, given that the country had carried out fewer than a 500,000 tests by the start of last week, compared with about 1.9m in Spain and Italy.The country’s response has been hamstrung by the resignation of two successive federal health ministers in the past month and complaints of inaction by the president, Jair Bolsonaro, a rightwing populist who continues to be critical of the shutdown measures implemented by Brazil’s state governments.“Unemployment, hunger and misery will be the future of those who support the tyranny of total isolation,” Bolsonaro tweeted, a day after Nelson Teich resigned on Friday after less than a month as health minister. Brazil is expected to post its biggest annual economic contraction this year since records began over a century ago.On Sunday Bolsonaro again undermined social distancing measures attending a small rally of supporters outside the presidential palace with two sons and several top ministers.“We hope soon to be free of this matter,” Brazil’s president said of Covid-19, according to the Folha de São Paulo newspaper. “Brazil, I’m certain, will be stonger for it.”Mexico, whose leftwing populist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has also been accused of not taking the virus seriously enough, is nearing 50,000 confirmed cases and experiencing what the country’s assistant health secretary has described as the most difficult moment so far in its effort to contain the virus.India’s official caseload passed that of China at the weekend. Nearly a third of the country’s 90,000-plus cases have been detected in the financial capital, Mumbai. The Indian government has said the spread of the virus is slowing despite the difficulties of physical distancing in many cities.The Narendra Modi government on Sunday extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks though some elements would be relaxed to relieve the economic burden of the quarantine, which has triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers back to their home cities and villages.Cases in Russia increased by more than 9,700 on Sunday, a greater rise than on the previous day. The nationwide total stands at at more than 280,000.Spain recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months on Sunday. The country has confirmed 231,350 cases of the virus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and has reported 27,650 deaths.The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced on Saturday that his socialist-led coalition would be seeking a final, month-long extension of the state of emergency underpinning one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.“The path that we are taking is the only one possible,” he said. The government secured the current extension, which expires on 24 May, despite fierce opposition from the conservative People’s party and the far-right Vox party.Both parties claim the state of emergency is excessive and no longer necessary, but the government says Spain’s hard-won gains against the virus must be safeguarded.

But scientists cannot agree on the causeOn 8 March this year, the Amsterdam Mixed Choir gave a performance of Bach’s St John Passion in the city’s Concertgebouw auditorium. It was one of the last major classical concerts to be held in the Netherlands before the country went into Covid-19 lockdown.The performance had unexpected consequences. Days later, singers began to sicken, one by one, until 102 of 130 choristers had fallen ill with Covid-19. One 78-year-old died, as did three partners of choir members singers ended up in intensive care and conductor Paul Valk displayed serious symptoms.Nor was this the only major chorus to suffer from Covid-19. Members of the Skagit Valley Chorale, based in Washington State, met for a rehearsal in March and within three weeks, 45 of them had been diagnosed with the disease or had symptoms. Three were hospitalised and two died. Similarly 50 members of the Berlin Cathedral Choir contracted the coronavirus after a March rehearsal, and in England many members of the Voices of Yorkshire choir became infected with a Covid-like disease earlier this year.These alarming developments raise a critical question. Does public singing – not just in choirs, but at football matches or at birthday parties – help transmit the coronavirus that is the cause of Covid-19? Jamie Lloyd-Smith, an infectious diseases researcher at University College Los Angeles, said it was possible that an infected singer might disperse viral particles further than other infected iniduals. “One could imagine that really trying to project your voice would also project more droplets and aerosols,” he told the Los Angeles Times. In this way, the virus would cause increased numbers of infections.The idea is alarming. A traditional pastime imbued with widespread cultural importance appears to be posing a distinct threat to the health of singers, concert-goers, football fans and a host of others.But not all scientists agree with the idea that our musical appetites pose a health. In particular, fluid mechanics expert Professor Christian Kähler of the Military University, Munich was highly doubtful about the dangers posed by concerts and decided to conduct experiments in the wake of the Amsterdam outbreak to find out how far singers and musicians expel air and droplets.“I have been studying how droplets and aerosols behave for decades and I was very doubtful that musicians and singers were spreading the virus. So I decided to measure just how strong was the airflow from them,” Kahler told the Observer last week. “We studied singing in low and high frequencies and all sorts of things like that. We also studied different instruments. And based on the flow analysis we did of these performances we could clearly see what was going on.”And yes, one or two instruments did pose threats in terms of their powerful air flow and might spread virus particles dangerously if some form of protection was not added. In particular the flute is especially strong while the oboe and clarinet also posed problems. “The large wind instruments like the horn were not dangerous but the flute could be, it turned out. Its air flow is considerable.“However, we also found out that singing is quite safe. It was not the cause of the outbreaks of Covid-19 at these concerts ,” he said. “Air was only propelled about half a metre in front of a singer, and that is not far enough to cause the infection levels of these outbreaks.”Kähler said the virus was probably spread among chorus members because of their close proximity to each other before and after rehearsals and performances. As he pointed out: “These outbreaks among choir members all occurred during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, before lockdowns were imposed and before our minds were concentrated on the importance of social distancing. Choir members probably greeted each other with hugs, and shared drinks during breaks and talked closely with each other. That social behaviour was the real cause of these outbreaks, I believe.”This point was also stressed by Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “The evidence for a link with singing and spreading the virus may look compelling but is still anecdotal,” he said. “Without data from comparably large groups who interacted in the same way but didn’t sing, it’s hard to be certain that the singing was responsible.“The point is that we now live in a world where the constant need for risk evaluation is suddenly noticeable. Before, we did it all the time without thinking about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd3c85059852c298d1c17f8777a5d0ff80b77aca/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6487fec7c2246f2adbc7abe86d2c93e0","title":"egyptian editor held in covid 19 reporting crackdown","story":"Lina Attalah, founder of Mada Masr, arrested while talking to jailed activist’s motherEgyptian security forces briefly arrested the founder of the country’s last independent media outlet in a growing crackdown on freedom of expression linked to Covid-19.Lina Attalah, the editor-in-chief of the website Mada Masr, was arrested outside Tora prison in the south of Cairo while interviewing the mother of a jailed activist attempting to bring medication and hand sanitiser to her son.The activist, Abd El Fattah, has been on hunger strike since mid-April in protest at deteriorating prison conditions, including the risk of the spread of coronavirus as well as the suspension of visits and trial hearings due to the pandemic.Atallah was taken to a police station and held for undisclosed charges, before she was questioned by a prosecutor. She was later ordered to be released on bail of 2,000 Egyptian pounds (£105).Mada Masr reported that Attalah’s mobile phone was seized and the media outlet’s lawyer was prevented from seeing Atallah while in detention.The journalist was recognised by Time magazine as a “new-generation leader,” in 2017, when she was branded the “muckraker of the Arab world”. Mada Masr is internationally recognised as the last bastion of press freedom in Egypt, a lone award-winning independent outlet in a repressive media environment where the majority of newspapers are state-controlled.Plainclothes security officials raided Mada Masr’s offices last November and Attalah was detained. She was released following international pressure. The website of Mada Masr has been blocked in Egypt since May 2017, one of at least 500 sites blocked in the country.Attalah’s arrest is part of a pattern of repression connected to Covid-19. Egyptian security forces detained another journalist, Hassan Mahgoub, at his home in early May after he reported a series of stories about the virus. Atef Hasballah, an editor, was bundled into the back of a police van and accused of joining a terrorist group in April after questioning the government’s official statistics about Covid-19 on his Facebook page.Egypt is considered one of the world’s leading jailers of journalists, ranked 166 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders.Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service and the head of the journalists’ syndicate, did not respond when contacted for comment.Timothy Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy and a longtime friend of Attalah, said: “Lina’s arrest is yet another example of Egypt’s persistent assault on journalists. It’s worrisome that the latest round of crackdowns coincides with the Covid pandemic. Egyptian authorities may presume this leaves foreign capitals distracted and unprepared to emphasise concerns about political freedoms. A free press that the public can trust for information is all the more vital during a health crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ddf792119f8dcb67d3a152530342592b9f4ed3/0_150_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dd107cc3e653ace2512d0d2ece97eb0","title":"michael gove tells councils to look to their responsibilities and open schools","story":"Minister asks local authorities refusing to allow pupils back on 1 June to ‘think again’Michael Gove has told local authorities refusing to reopen their schools on 1 June to “look to their responsibilities”, saying: “If you really care about children, you’ll want them in schools.”Appearing on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, the Cabinet Office minister said: “We are confident that children and teachers will be safe.”He said schools could implement staggered lunch breaks and arrival times, seat children at inidual desks and teach them in classes of 15 at most, supervised by one adult.Asked what he would say to councils, including Liverpool’s and Greater Manchester’s, which have questioned the plan, he said: “I respectfully ask them to think again.“The clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen, accompanied with social distancing.”He added: “Children only have one chance at education. Over the course of the last decade we’ve made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and the poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that backwards.“If you really care about children, you’ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.”The government has asked schools to prepare to open their doors to children from reception, year 1 and year 6 from next month.But some councils, including Liverpool, Hartlepool and Greater Manchester, have said they will not be implementing the plan.In a letter to parents, Liverpool’s director of children’s services, Steve Reddy, said: “Our guiding principle is that schools can only reopen to other pupils when it is safe to do so and not a moment before.”In the clearest explanation yet of the government’s rationale for its “stay alert” approach to the next phase of the crisis, Gove said it was impossible to eliminate completely the risk of catching Covid-19, unless people were kept “perpetually imprisoned in their homes”.“The whole point about life is that you need to manage risk,” he said. “We cannot have a situation where we keep our economy and our schools and our public services continually closed down, because the health consequences of doing so would be malign as well.”In a separate interview on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Gove announced that the government had recruited 17,000 coronavirus contact tracers, and would be ready to roll out the system nationwide by the end of this month.Building up the ability to find and control new local outbreaks is a central part of the government’s approach to progressively reopening schools, and the wider economy.The outsourcing giant Serco was given the contract to recruit the call-centre workers needed to run the new system.The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 had been hired, but when Gove was asked for a number on Sunday, he said, “just over 17,000”.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, had suggested 18,000 contact tracers would be in place by the middle of this month.Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. “We’re on course to meet that target. It’s more evidence that we have, in Matt, an energetic and determined health secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against this virus,” he said.The government gave up trying to track every case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community, with the deputy chief medical officer for England Jenny Harries saying at the time: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.”But the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, and Hancock’s predecessor Jeremy Hunt have consistently called for community tracing.The government also announced this weekend a third large-scale study to track the progress of the virus, and try to establish how many people may have built up some immunity to it.Teaching unions have said the implementation of a testing and tracking system should be a precondition for schools reopening – so that inidual outbreaks can be controlled.The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, backed their stance on the BBC Marr show, saying: “We urge the government to publish the science, and to ensure the test, track and isolate is in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c31a9952d4dabdddb2d5baf14c6eb54eee0e12d3/0_24_1047_628/master/1047.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a38b881014cdf7970d638f44fa9ca848","title":"plan study nicotine patches potential coronavirus treatment covid 19","story":"Doctors in Wales could stage trial after suggestion smokers may be less at risk of Covid-19Plans are being made to investigate the potential of nicotine patches to combat Covid-19 after the idea was raised by doctors at a hospital in Wales where the improvised treatment is being practised.France moved last week to prevent the stockpiling of nicotine products after its health minister took an interest in a French study that suggested smokers may be much less at risk of contracting the virus.However, doctors in Wales who published their own suggestions in January on the use of the stimulants in coronavirus treatment have been discussing the possibility of a formal trial.“We saw the pandemic coming from China and then the horrific stories from Italy, so we were doing our own research and looking at as many papers as we could,” said Jonathan Davies, a consultant trauma surgeon at Royal Glamorgan hospital, where physicians have been routinely giving out nicotine patches to patients with coronavirus and who had been smokers.The result was a short paper published in the British Medical Journal which stated that, at least in chronic smokers, the lung injuries in those infected with Covid-19 were being exacerbated by nicotine withdrawal. The addictive stimulant could interfere with the production of elements that led to inflammation, according to its authors.“Of course, everyone should stop smoking. If you are a smoker then you are at risk of all the secondary complications if the virus does take hold,” said Davies. But he suggested in such cases nicotine could be used as a supplement.The suggestion by Davies and colleagues led to conversations with Prof Judith Hall of Cardiff University, a medical innovator involved in global development who has said she will approach British funding bodies for support to trial the potential role of nicotine in managing Covid-19.The idea was an interesting one, she said, though its value would be difficult to prove.“Getting trials under way is of course time-consuming and complicated business, but we must try and advance new ideas as quickly as possible in this crisis,” she added.In France, research at a major Paris hospital suggested a substance in tobacco – possibly nicotine – may be stopping patients who smoke from catching Covid-19. Clinical trials of nicotine patches are awaiting the approval of the country’s health authorities.While nicotine may protect smokers from the virus, those who have caught it often develop more serious symptoms because of the toxic effect of tobacco smoke on the lungs, they say.The team at Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital questioned 480 patients who tested positive for the virus, 350 of whom were hospitalised while the rest with less serious symptoms were allowed home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7af8bae3a94e9a9c40cf6681d767ce230b00ce/0_110_4293_2575/master/4293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3711ca0cf0b85a8552d71a8c1bf6966d","title":"quebec masks mandatory veil ban coronavirus","story":"The Canadian province passed a law less than a year affecting religious minorities’ face coverings – now the pandemic may prompt a rethinkLess than a year after passing a secularism law forcing certain members of religious minorities to uncover their heads and faces, Quebec is now debating whether to force everybody to put masks on.As the province at the centre of Canada’s coronavirus outbreak, Quebec is currently “strongly recommending” that citizens wear masks – but the measure will not be mandatory.Asked why not, Horacio Arruda, the province’s public health director, told reporters: “You need to have a good argument for infringing on inidual rights for the sake of a collective right.”But such arguments ring hollow to Nour Farhat, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work.The law – known as Bill 21 – mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors.“Bill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we’re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people’s rights,” Farhat said.“For them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities.”Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law.But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women’s heads in the province. And only last year did Montreal reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests.The contradictions have inspired wry commentary: the Canadian satire website the Beaverton recently published a story headlined “Quebec suddenly fine with people covering their faces”.There is precedent for making masks mandatory, said the prominent civil rights lawyer Julius Grey, who said that the ban on smoking indoors was upheld despite suggestions that it infringed on aspects of the country’s charter of rights.He added that physical distancing measures currently enacted may already violate some charter rights, such as freedom of association – albeit for good reason.Quebec has seen more cases of coronavirus and more deaths than any other region of Canada, but the provincial government has delivered mixed messages on whether masks help limit the spread of Covid-19.On 18 March, Arruda said in a minute-long video public service announcement: “Masks don’t prevent community transmission … If you want to protect yourself, it’s not the mask that matters. Just wash your hands.”A string of conflicting statements from provincial and federal officials followed, until Canada’s chief public health officer, Dr Theresa Tam, said in early April that wearing masks in public would help limit the spread of Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have made similar statements.Globally, examples abound of communities that implemented mandatory masks. Jena, a German city of about 110,000, did so in late March and saw a swift slowdown in Covid-19 infection rates. Its approach has been so successful that it was able to reopen bars and restaurants this past week.A spokesperson for the Quebec government said there were no plans to make masks mandatory until scientific evidence is published showing that they reduce community transmission of Covid-19 and enough can be provided to supply the entire province.Meanwhile, Quebec’s own public health institute has published reports strongly recommending everyone wear masks in public.Farhat said she found the bureaucratic back-and-forth frustrating and hypocritical.“This is life and death. This is the best example we can have for the government to infringe on human rights for a good reason – and the government won’t make the call. This is really irresponsible,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4361503416f1399edc222b7ee8deaf70ad15b6e7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e492e9ddea6a66b91cc1f5577f204e2b","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 17 may 2020","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 4,702,603, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus resource center.

Oranga Tamariki’s chief executive, Gráinne Moss, told the  that reports of harm always drop over the school holidays, because the “eyes and ears” that usually identify harm – education, social and health workers – aren’t around.But the prolonged nature of lockdown and the added stress of job losses among already strained families was creating “a perfect storm”, Moss said, and rises in family violence overseas are likely to hold true in New Zealand too, though no local research has been conducted yet.“Lockdown is a lot longer than the school holidays so we are right to be concerned that there is hidden, invisible harm occurring to children,” Moss said.In the US, the Republican senator Ben Sasse’s attempt at humor during a speech for high school students has drawn strong criticism, the AP reports.

The iPhone maker in March shut all its stores outside of Greater China in response to the spread of the coronavirus. It started shutting its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March.“Our commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,” Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s head of retail, wrote on Sunday in a note on the company’s website.The stores will impose social-distancing rules, limit occupancy and some will offer only curbside or storefront service, she said.Last week, Apple reopened its first five stores in the United States, requiring customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the premises.Apple has 510 stores worldwide and 271 in the United States. The website 9to5Mac reported that the company would reopen 10 of its stores in Italy beginning on Tuesday.

It says it is providing the service to about 300 secondary schools.Emily Brick, the firm’s founder, says its predictions are based on students’ previous in-house results in fifth- and sixth-year exams, combined with national data on Leaving Cert results trends.The fact that, nationally, results in each subject fall into a bell curve in line with previous years makes predicting results a challenge suited to predictive analytics.“We tested this model including all other past results but found that using results any earlier than that, including aptitude tests done on entrance to school, did not improve the accuracy of the predictions,” she said.Even with subjects where there are no previous results – which is often the case with students studying minority languages like Polish, Russian, Romanian – it is possible to predict results accurately by examining their other subject results. The main limitation, she says, is that a statistical solution will only take into account past results and cannot allow for students whose potential is not reflected in their exam results to date. “The other limitation, which is of course not a concern, is that a statistical solution will not take into account students who do not meet their potential on the day of the exam, for whatever reason,” she says.Mock exams and past papersSchools in Ireland which offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) – an internationally recognised equivalent to the Leaving Cert – also say predicted grades are a long-standing feature of their exam process.Chis Charleson, director of SEK Dublin International School near Greystones, Co Wicklow, says there is about 60 per cent accuracy in use of predicted grades versus final grades.“Our teachers use mock exams and past papers to give students a predicted grade in advance of the written exams, which are marked externally,” he says.“It can flag an error in the marking process if a child is, for example, two grades out from their predicted grade. If that’s the case, there is an automatic check of the grade.”The cancellation of the written exams for the IB this year means students are being awarded grades based on their completed coursework, which is being marked externally.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255697.1589736196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gifts for teachers to be treated as serious attempt to undermine leaving cert grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh has defended the process and says schools will award students’ grades and not the Department of Education. Photograph: Crispin RodwellAny attempt to offer teachers gifts or inducements in relation to students’ Leaving Cert results will be treated as a “serious attempt”to interfere with an entire school’s grades, under new Department of Education rules.Department officials are finalising official guidance for teachers and schools over the use of calculated grades for students and it is likely to issue to teachers’ representatives in the middle of this week.Unions have been pushing for a protocol to be included in the guidance which states that any inappropriate contact with teachers or schools will be formally recorded and forwarded to the department.The draft guidance document is understood to state that parents or students must not under any circumstances contact, directly or indirectly, a teacher or other staff member to discuss estimated marks or class rankings.“Such contact would be regarded as totally inappropriate and a serious attempt to interfere with the fairness and objectivity required of teachers and schools in the assigning of estimated marks and ranking for the inidual student concerned and for the students in the school as a whole,” according to new department guidance.It also states that any attempt by teachers to allow discussion of estimated grades before the process is complete would interfere with the process being carried out properly and fairly. InfluencingIt says that if teachers discuss the marks with some students but not others, or if some teachers did this and others did not, these discussions might actually influence or be construed as influencing the mark the teacher submits to the subject alignment group.Teachers’ Union of Ireland president Séamus Lahart said while calculated grades was not the preference of its members, teachers will work to implement them to the best of their ability.“We’re working with other stakeholders to produce guidelines to enable teachers to do this as best as possible,” he said.“We hope it will issue to teachers very soon. Our advice in the meantime is to wait until guidelines are issued before engaging in the process. When this happens, teachers will assign appropriate grades to students.”The Labour Party, meanwhile, has written to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission urging it to investigate whether the use of “school profiling” in the use of calculated grades will penalise disadvantaged students.This is a reference to the standardisation process that will occur when schools submit their calculated grades for students.Under its official guidance, the department says estimated marks from each school will be adjusted to bring them into line with the “expected distribution” based on previous years.Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán O Riordan said the use of this approach was “fundamentally unfair” and will impact on the capacity of some students to achieve their potential.“This issue cannot be relegated to a mere political charge. It is appropriate that the commission assess the potential impact of this measure and make a statement accordingly.”Recognise achievementMinister for Education Joe McHugh has defended the process and said schools will award students’ grades and not the department.He also said the calculated grades process will recognise achievement by students or classes in disadvantaged schools – such as an honours maths class in the school that was not there a year ago.Mr McHugh said a standardisation process was needed to ensure there is fairness across the system.In an interview with Bere Island Community Radio on Sunday, he said independent experts will also be appointed to ensure the department’s standardisation process is fair to all students.He confirmed that guidelines for teachers are due to issue later this week and hoped Leaving Cert students will have their results in mid-August, or as “close to the traditional date as possible”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Getty ImagesOpticians will be unable to carry out full eye tests during a single appointment when they reopen on Monday, forcing patients to pay higher fees for routine care. The Association of Optometrists Ireland (AOI) is also worried about an increase in common conditions which can cause blindness because people are afraid to visit opticians even as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions are eased. Mark Daly, a former president of the association who runs practices in Dublin’s Drumcondra and Sandymount, said health guidance for their reopening is “very restrictive”. “We’re going to find a lot of the regular examinations we do, we can’t do within the 15 minutes we’re allowed to stay within close proximity to the patient,” he said. “We are going to have to bring them back to do a second appointment to finish certain things off. There are a number of examinations we could do within the 15 minutes, but in most cases we probably won’t be able to.”The AOI confirmed this would mean extra fees, although it suggested these would be at a “reduced rate”. Medical card holders will be spared the additional costs. Before the pandemic, full eye tests would typically take between 40 and 45 minutes. Because of social distancing and extra hygiene precautions, opticians expect they will now take about an hour. Under the new regime, it is expected eye patients will will be interviewed for about 15 minutes by telephone before making a timed appointment to visit the optician in person. More triage – socially distanced – will be carried out in the practice before basic tests can begin. Crucial devicesMeasures to stem the spread of the coronavirus also effectively bar opticians from using some crucial devices for tests. Many who used non-contact tonometers – which measure the internal pressure of the eye – will no longer be able to do so, because the pump of air from the machine causes particles to “fly all over the place”, said Mr Daly. “If we can’t use that, we can’t check the pressure in the eye and pressure in the eye is very important for picking up things like glaucoma,” he said. Glaucoma can lead to blindness if not diagnosed and treated early. Opticians have also been ordered not to carry out ophthalmoscopy procedures, a routine part of eye examination involving the use of a special torch to look inside the eye. One alternative will be the use of digital photography to forensically examine the eye. Furthermore, Mr Daly said he was concerned about late diagnosis of conditions – “which could get beyond control by the time they do come to us” – as he expects some people will stay away from eye tests over fears of contracting Covid-19. BlindnessMacular degeneration ( a degeneration of the back of the eye), glaucoma and cataracts can all can cause blindness if not detected and treated in time. “I would be worried there will be an increase in the number of these people,” Mr Daly said. “I’d be afraid of people who will have sight-threatening conditions, that we could sort for them, that they wouldn’t come in.” Sean McGrave, chief executive of the IOA, said he expects the “vast majority” of Ireland’s more than 350 opticians to reopen on Monday, but that some may stay shut over health concerns, lack of childcare or where part-time staff are better off on the emergency pandemic welfare payments. Opticians “have been hurting” for the past eight weeks as they had “no income whatsoever” and were forced to pay out substantial sums for personal protective equipment, perspex screens, signage and other safety measures. On the increased fees for patients forced to attend a second appointment, he said: “There will be some cases where we will have to get patients back in to complete tests. It wouldn’t be a full fee – it will be a reduced rate.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Varadkar had objected to Martin over TDs\u0027 attacks over election contingency plansEfforts to make dog walkers obey rules to safeguard birds in nature reserve \u0026lsquofutile\u0026rsquoMinister also dismisses idea of non-jury courts for ordinary crimes during pandemicOfficial guidance for schools over use of calculated grades to issue this weekAs certain categories of shop reopen on Monday, retailers focus on safety measuresHarris urges \u0026lsquocollective cop-on\u0026rsquo so that easing of restrictions does not reverse progressFears independent investigation could jeopardise pending criminal cases\u0026lsquoI know it\u0026rsquos an awful situation worldwide but treatment can\u0026rsquot stop or be withheld\u0026rsquoReopening restrictions on Monday could result in extra fees, but will be at a reduced rateConsultants will also face \u0026lsquooperational costs\u0026rsquo bill for seeing private patients at the hospitalGarda appeal for witnesses to incident which took place at 7. 15pm on the M1 northboundThe total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the State now stands at 24,112Section of the route has been closed to vehicles to aid social distancing amid Covid-19Nurseries, growers, centre owners count the cost of lockdown restrictions as easing beginsNurseries, growers, centre owners count the cost of lockdown restrictions as easing beginsThirteen garda\u0026iacute died by suicide in last three years 16,116 days lost due to mental illnessDepartment of Social Protection has withheld the \u0026euro350 payment to 46,000 peopleJosepha Madigan makes comments at National Famine Commemoration in DublinStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255785.1589746425!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fg accuses ff of damaging government formation talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Taoiseach Leo  Varadkar:  the pair  were in contact on Saturday nightSenior Fine Gael figures are now suggesting that Mr Martin should publicly disassociate himself from comments made by party TDs Barry Cowen and Thomas Byrne over government election contingency plansrevealed in The  on Saturday.Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin were in contact on Saturday night, and some in Fine Gael suggested that Mr Martin had time to take action prior to the Fine Gael statement being released on Sunday. Talks are continuing between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens on government formation, and the three party leaders will meet today (Monday). Mr Martin requested the meeting to discuss the slow pace of talks and leaks to the media.The Government says the election contingency plan being drawn up – including spreading voting over a number of days, giving “cocooners” a postal vote, and allowing polling in nursing homes – will also apply to potential referendums and byelections. Fianna Fáil was unaware of the plans, and party sources insisted it should have been told.Mr Cowen claimed Fine Gael was acting in “bad faith”, and suggested it was “putting party before country”. Mr Byrne, the Fianna Fáil education spokesman, claimed it was “utterly sick” to link nursing homes to suggestions of an election. A senior Fine Gael source said: “If we are in government in a few weeks’ time and Barry Cowen accuses FG of being unpatriotic, either he’ll be resigning or all FG ministers will be. “And if Thomas Byrne is a junior minister and attacks a Fine Gael colleague as being ‘sick’, a withdrawal and apology will be expected.”A Fianna Fáil source said confidence and supply was over, and that Mr Martin’s party was now in opposition. “We have to hold them to account,” the source said. It was also suggested by numerous Fianna Fáil sources that Mr Byrne was being targeted because he had highlighted difficulties with the Leaving Cert in recent weeks. Doing their job After Simon Coveney and Dara Calleary, the two deputy leaders of the parties, attempted to calm the issue, Fine Gael released a statement on Sunday, claiming officials were only doing their job, and that the attacks by Mr Cowen and Mr Byrne were “unwarranted” and “damaged” the talks process. The statement also singled out Mr Cowen on comments he made recently suggesting a referendum on land prices would be held by a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael government, suggesting he “had recently claimed falsely that both parties had agreed to hold a referendum within weeks of forming a government, presumably during a pandemic”.There was concern on Sunday night across Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about the lack of trust between the two traditional rivals.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255521.1589722331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"majority of covid 19 test results within three days says hse","story":"The vast majority of Covid-19 testing and contact tracing will be completed within the target time of three days from tomorrow, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid.

Photograph: PAThe vast majority of Covid-19 testing and contact tracing will be completed within the target time of three days from tomorrow, according to HSE chief executive Paul Reid. Last week, 80 per cent of tests were being completed from swabbing to completion of contact tracing within four days, against a target of 85 per cent within five days, he said.From next week, the HSE expects to be able to complete “end to end” testing and contact tracing within three days in 90 per cent of cases, Mr Reid told the weekly HSE briefing.Almost 98 per cent of people tested for Covid-19 will get the result by text in two days or less, he said, as the process of informing people of negative results is automated.The positivity rate has fallen to 2.4 per cent, down from a high of 24 per cent at an earlier stage of the pandemic, meaning no contact tracing is needed for the vast majority of people tested.Mr Reid said on Sunday swabbing tests were now being scheduled “practically always” on the same day as they were sought.The system was now geared up to provide 100,000 tests a week, in 41 labs in Ireland and Germany, according to Mr Reid, had an average turnaround time of two days or less.With a limited reopening set to start on Monday Mr Reid urged the public to continue to “stay safe” and said everyone still had a collective duty of care through their actions to protect loved ones and healthcare workers.He said the health service can go into next week and the easing of restrictions with “a level of confidence”. The number of Covid-19 patients in ICU, at 54, is 67 per cent compared to early April and there had been a “significant downward climb” in confirmed cases in hospital.The HSE now wants to scale up non-Covid services but this would be happening in an “unpredictable environment”, he said.In relation to the controversy over the reporting of cases by the Mater hospital, Mr Reid said the HSE has received a draft outline report on the issue.Mr Reid said the legal requirement to report data had been met by the hospital, and that contact tracing there has been completed.However, the information from the hospital that was submitted to the labs did not have full details - including full names of cases.‘’Therefore it did not allow the HSE to compile a complete correlation of the data at the appropriate time,’’ Mr Reid said.HSE chief Clinical Officer Dr Colm Henry has sought assurances from all hospitals that the data submitted to labs is complete.Currently, the HSE is performing an average of 4,000 tests per day.

Photograph: Laura HuttonNever have so many waited so long for so few shops to open. While the green light for handpicked retailers to resume trading this morning will be met with relief by many and viewed as a tangible sign that the end of the beginning phase of the coronavirus crisis is within sight, there will be anxiety too.A hardware shop or optician or bicycle shop opening on a Monday morning would not normally be greeted with excitement or require barriers, but it is a measure of how much our world has changed that tentative steps towards reopening Ireland have been met with palpable enthusiasm.David Fitzsimons, chief executive of Retail Excellence, says today marks “the first steps on the road to recovery” and said retailers were “ingenious and resourceful” and had “invested great effort in planning for today to ensure they open safely for their customers and colleagues”.He also stresses “the importance of our local independent stores” and encouraged consumers to use them “as we don’t want to lose them”.One such retailer is Rachel Doyle, of the Arboretum Garden Heaven in Carlow and Kilquade, Co Wicklow. She says the company has “put a huge effort in to be ready” and bemoans a lost season of planting.Many retailers have put in similar efforts, and the manner in which most have announced their return has been striking. Gone are the bold and brash promises of sales and special offers that would normally follow even the briefest of breaks from business-as-usual instead retailers allowed to reopen have been boasting about the measures they will take to ensure customers can keep their distance from one another and stay safe.Declan Ronayne, chief executive of Woodies, was not talking deals and discounts when he spoke on radio late last week, stressing that his company’s “primary focus when we reopen ... will be managing queues of people ... We have a steely determination to keep everyone as safe as we can.”Ronayne said he was both nervous and excited to reopen after the seven-week closure, the longest Woodies has experienced since it opened its doors in the 1990s.Barriers have been installed outside many of the larger DIY shops across the country to facilitate safer queuing, and staff will be policing the lines.Child banEven before Woodies restarted trading it was making headlines after announcing on Twitter that under-16s would not be allowed into the shops due to social-distancing concerns.It later reversed the decision and said under-16s were welcome if accompanied by an adult.“However, where possible, we would still encourage customers to shop on their own. We value all of our customers and do not want anyone to feel excluded and look forward to a day when family groups can again shop together.”The move initially dismayed many solo parents of young children who risked being left behind as they could scarcely leave their children at home or with friends and family as they shop.The lead-up to the tentative beginning of the end of the lockdown has seen missteps and there has been a degree of confusion and disappointment for some retailers left behind in the first wave.Ikea announced last week it would be back in business today. Then, at the last minute, homeware shops were struck off the opening list, leaving the flatpack kings – and other shops that had been dusting off their soft furnishings – deflated.Minister for Health Simon Harris was unapologetic, saying “now is not the time to decide I’m going to dicky up the house”.The lifting of restrictions has been carefully managed and tweaked over fears that people will “descend on hardware stores and garden centres in large numbers”, which could result in a rise in rates of infection.Harris has warned consumers they are facing the “biggest national test so far” and pointed out that “we have to find a way to live with this virus. There is no vaccine, there is no effective treatment. It has not gone away.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4254619.1589722712!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"third generation cork building firm ready for return to work","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConor Cahalane with his son Donal at a Cahalane Brothers site in Dunmanway, west Cork. Photograph: Daragh McSweeney ProvisionCork builder Conor Cahalane knows what it is like to weather economic storms, having survived recessions in the 1970s, 1980s and the brutal collapse after 2008.Now the 63-year-old, at the helm at Cahalane Brothers Ltd, a third-generation construction company founded in the 1930s, where his sons, Donal (35) and Cian (33),also work, is preparing to get back to work on Monday.“It’s always a case of boom and bust in the building sector. It’s a cycle. If you work in construction, you have to be optimistic,” he says. “This is a new challenge, but we’re used to problem solving.”From Monday, as part of the nation’s first steps out of the Covid-19-imposed lockdown, Cahalane Brothers and 70-plus permanent employees will return to 15 construction sites across west Cork and Cork city.The thought of getting back to work cheers him, even with all the necessary restrictions, but Conor Cahalane – whose business is based in Dunmanway – has no illusions about the challenges that lie ahead.However, there are some positive signs. Unlike 2008, the construction sector is not coming off a debt-fuelled boom. “It’s at a good steady level, whereas prior to the last recession it was out of proportion,” he says.The Government’s next move will decide everyone’s future, he says. After 2008, the State’s capital budget dried up. This time, the Government must continue to invest, he adds.“Unless the Government continues to spend on the construction sector, we’ll be in for a big fall. Investment in the construction sector is one of the best ways of stimulating the economy.”Like everyone else, Cahalane Brothers shut down in March, although a small number of workers continued at a few essential sites, including a west Cork food plant and pandemic-linked emergency construction at Cork University Hospital.Safety rulesThe company is building a €10 million expansion of Clonakilty Community College and an extension for another school, along with 20 two-, three- and four-storey social houses in Dunmanway.Ten employees will return to work on the houses, which are nearing completion. “We expect seven of the 20 houses to be ready for handover in the next month, and the rest should be completed by the end of the summer,” he says.The company’s full-time workers will return first, with contractors coming back on a phased basis.Health and safety rules will be obeyed, says Donal Cahalane, the company’s project engineer. “We’re confident we have the means and procedures already in place and we’re familiar with them.”Extra hand washing and sanitary rules will be the norm, along with mandatory use of visors, masks and gloves in places where the 2m social-distancing rules cannot be observed.“The precautions we have to take now will be an expense that needs to be considered. Everything needs consideration and planning, but we don’t feel the restrictions will prevent projects from continuing or commencing,” he says.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255631.1589728475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu urges vigilance to avoid coronavirus second wave","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean commissioner for health Stella Kyriakides as she prepared to address a media conference on tourism in Brussels. Photograph: AP Rigorous testing and tracing regimes and real-time reporting of Covid-19 cases are essential to avoid a second wave of the virus as countries ease restrictions, the European Union’s health commissioner has said.“We cannot risk, and I’m sure you agree with me, an uncontrolled resurgence of this virus,” Dr Stella Kyriakides told The . “We have over one million cases now in the EU. We cannot lower our guard. And we are going to have to adapt to a new reality.”A Cypriot clinical psychologist and politician, Dr Kyriakides was appointed to the health and food safety portfolio under European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in December.She was thrust into the unprecedented position of trying to help co-ordinate the response of the 27-member states to a pandemic, which revealed the commission to be awkwardly caught between expectations of pan-European response, and the reality that powers over health and border policy are solely in the hands of member states.She rejects accusations that the commission was slow to react, noting that when it asked national governments whether they had sufficient supplies of protective equipment in January, they responded that they had.Dr Kyriakides spoke to the  after the EU’s executive released guidelines intended to help member states to edge towards reopening borders and international travel, while managing the risk it could lead to a resurgence in cases.Designed in co-ordination with the bloc’s disease prevention agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the guidelines emphasise that rigorous testing and tracing regimes, including contact-tracing apps, should be in place so that national authorities can identify and corner new cases before they spread.“Whether we have an upsurge cases . . . will very much depend on the way that we manage this next stage of lifting of containment measures,” said Dr Kyriakides. “There are certain criteria that have to be very robust so that we don’t have a second wave.”When assessing whether to open up borders and ease travel, countries must examine how prevalent the disease is in the other country. For this, it is essential for national authorities to have accurate data on the level of their outbreak.“It’s very important that member states . . . that their surveillance system themes are able to capture all iniduals with symptoms compatible with Covid, and to be able to test and if necessary isolate, so that there is a very transparent picture in member states of what their epidemiological situation is,” said Dr Kyriakides.Finding a vaccineThe European Commission led an international fundraising drive earlier this month to raise finances for the search for a vaccine and for treatments for coronavirus, gathering some €7.4 billion in pledges from world leaders to pay for research and development.“The only way forward out of this pandemic will be after we find the vaccine, and we have the effective therapeutics, because the virus is going to be with us for a very long time,” said Dr Kyriakides.The EU is now co-ordinating on a plan of how to prioritise the distribution of doses if a vaccine is developed, potentially starting with those most vulnerable to the disease and healthcare workers.She admits however that whether or not a vaccine is found is “not a given”.“One needs to look at this in a continuum,” said Dr Kyriakides. “There is no situation where suddenly everything is finished.” The commissioner has proposed using funds from the common EU budget to increase the limited capacity of pharmaceutical laboratories to make vaccine shots. The next step is to adopt a long-term pharmaceutical strategy that would reduce dependence on international trade for vital medical supplies.“The EU depends for production of active ingredients, and also for some medicines, on countries outside the EU,” said Dr Kyriakides. “This pandemic has highlighted some of the weaknesses that we have now in terms of medicines in Europe.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"churches poised introduce drive services northern ireland","story":"Churches are poised to introduce the first “drive through” services during the UK national lockdown in an attempt to encourage churchgoers to return to worship.Enforced social distancing measures could see congregations confined to their vehicles as leaders conduct hymns and bible readings from a stage in church car parks.First popularised by American evangelicalists in the 1950s, the services are designed to allow worshippers to attend church events before numbers of people allowed to gather are widened.France and Germany are among countries that have introduced “drive-in” religious gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic.It comes as Boris Johnson faces increasing pressure from the clergy to reopen churches.In a letter published in The Times earlier this month, more than 800 clergymen claimed the excessive ecclesiastical lockdown represented “a failure of the Church\u0027s responsibility to the nation”.On Friday, Mr Johnson disclosed he had spoken with the Most Rev Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, about allowing churches to reopen in a call with the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs.Under the Government\u0027s current lockdown strategy, places of worship could reopen on July 4 at the earliest but some leaders warned church services might not return to normal before the end of the year.The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, said there would need to be significant changes to key aspects of Christian worship “for some time” to come.She said: “I don\u0027t envisage, even up to the end of the year, we will be back to our normal services. We\u0027ll have some churches doing things differently.”In Northern Ireland, ministers are due to discuss allowing “drive through” services as part of a gradual relaxing of restrictions.The proposals, which have yet to receive final approval, were published by the Northern Ireland Executive last week.Church officials have welcomed the plans with arrangements under way on how to transform facilities.Billy Jones, pastor of the Dunseverick Baptist Church, told The : “Hopefully from next Sunday, I will be leading the sermon from a lorry which has a platform attached with a sound system. People can tune in to a specific radio frequency from their vehicles too if they want.”“It will mean the local community can come together with a desire to encounter god and can enjoy the fellowship by expressing faith - even if it is from their cars.”Churches in England have said they are monitoring the situation and will consider adopting similar “drive through” services if the measures prove successful.Kevin Felix-Hollington, pastor at Halling Baptist Church, in Kent, said:  “We could convert our car park, block the entrance and space chairs out at a two metre distance so worshippers would be able to follow the rules and listen to a sermon. I think this could happen in the near future.”“We have even considered the possibility of having open air meetings, where people could come in clusters and sit down on the grass at the local park to listen to a pastor pray and sign.”“At the moment we are doing our services on Zoom, which involves bible reading and sing-a-longs, with a discussion at the end to follow up on the message.”The Church of England said it was unable to comment, while the Church of Scotland ruled out allowing “drive through” services in its churches.Other churches have adopted imaginative measures to spread their message to worshippers at home.St John the Baptist Church, in Leicester, has turned to Minecraft to teach youngsters about Christianity during the lockdown.The church has been digitally recreated on a server so that the youth club can play Bible themed games online with each other every Wednesday.On Minecraft, instead of a field and houses surrounding the church as they do in real life, there is a sea with the whale from the story of Jonah to explore, for example.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"felicien kabuga captured africas wanted mastermind behind rwandan","story":"French police seized the man regarded as the intellectual and financial mastermind behind the Rwandan genocide on Saturday, ending a transcontinental 26-year manhunt for “the Eichmann of Africa”.Félicien Kabuga, Africa’s most wanted fugitive, was arrested in the northern outskirts of Paris after a dawn raid on his flat in the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine. Officers said the 84 year-old had been living there under an assumed identity.French authorities released few details about the operation, beyond hailing the capture of “one of the world’s most wanted fugitives”. It is believed that a series of simultaneous raids were carried out on addresses across France, some linked to Kabuga’s children, to ensure that he did not escape.Those familiar with the investigation suggested that the operation, at least in terms of the painstaking intelligence work involved, had echoes of the Mossad mission to seize the Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann from Buenos Aires in 1960.The British security services played an “essential” role in the operation that led to Kabuga’s capture, according to United Nations prosecutors. So, too, did investigators in the United States, which has long had a $5 million (£4.1m) bounty on his head, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland.Kabuga will not be sedated and spirited away to Rwanda in the way Eichmann was smuggled into Israel, where he was tried and hanged for his role as a primary architect of the Final Solution.Instead he will eventually be handed over to a United Nations tribunal to answer longstanding charges of crimes against humanity.Even so there will be considerable relief in Rwanda, where 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered over a 100-day period in 1994 — a massacre carried out by a cabal of Hutu extremists with Kabuga, one of the country’s richest men, allegedly at its core.Without the fortune he acquired through his tea and coffee estates, the genocide might never happened have happened. In 1992, Kabuga ploughed money into Radio Television Libres Milles Collines (RTLM), a radio station that steadily dripped hatred towards the country’s Tutsi minority.The following year, he allegedly began to import into the country hundreds of thousands of machetes, which were doled out to the Interahamwe, an extremist Hutu militia accused of overseeing much of the slaughter.As the genocide began, Interahamwe militiamen, wearing uniforms reportedly provided by Kabuga, were transported from killing site to killing site in his organisation’s vehicles, investigators say.Meanwhile, Radio Milles Collines provided the soundtrack of the genocide, urging Hutus to hunt down and kill the Tutsi “inyenzi”, or cockroaches. “The graves are only half full,” the station’s presenters would warn. “We must complete the task.”After the genocide, which ended when Tutsi rebels led by Paul Kagame, now Rwanda’s president, swept into the capital Kigali, Kabuga vanished.After a quarter of a century of leads that grew ever colder, many had given up hope of bringing him to justice.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which tried 76 key genocide suspects, ceased operations on New Year’s Eve 2015 without ever laying its hands on the suspect many prosecutors most wanted to put in the dock.Instead, Kabuga will now be tried by the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, an obscure body created to mop up the unfinished business left behind by the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.For the body’s chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, the capture of Kabuga is a triumph as unalloyed as it is unexpected.“The arrest of Félicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even twenty-six years after their crimes,” he said. “This arrest demonstrates the impressive results that can be achieved through international law enforcement and judicial cooperation.” But amid the relief in Rwanda there will also be anger that it has taken so long to hunt Kabuga down. According to UN officials, he had lived in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya during his years on the run. His move to France is thought to have happened in the last three years.How one of the world’s most wanted men managed to cross international borders with such ease remains an unanswered question. But money and connections almost certainly had something to do with it.The bulk of Kabuga’s years as a fugitive are thought to have been spent in Kenya. Here he is said to have enjoyed the protection of officials close to Daniel arap Moi, the former Kenyan president, who died in February.Moi was a close friend of Juvenal Habyarimana, the Hutu president whose killing on 6th April 1994 triggered the long-planned genocide. Two of Kabuga’s daughters married President Habyarimana’s sons, giving the tycoon close access to the Kenyan leader.According to a Kenyan government source, the FBI came close to arresting Kabuga shortly after Moi retired in 2002 when a local journalist, William Gichuki, walked into the US embassy in Nairobi and said he knew where the Rwandan was hiding.But before the FBI could act, Gichuki was murdered. Whether Kenyan intelligence had tipped Kabuga off is unclear. The US embassy never acknowledged its connection to Gichuki but it did release a pointed statement after Kenyan police showed reluctance to investigate his murder.Kenya’s apparent refusal to hand over Kabuga strained relations with the United States. In 2009, Barack Obama sent Stephen Rapp, his adviser on war crimes, to Kenya to deliver a public and pointed message to Moi’s successor, Mwai Kibaki. The US, Mr Rapp said, “had credible information on the fugitive’s location and the powerful people protecting him.”But the Kenyan government would not budge. In late 2017, a prominent human rights activist, Ken Wafula, told The Daily  that Kabuga had been tracked down to the Kenyan town of Eldoret by two men, the editor of a local newspaper and a whistleblower who had previously worked as an agent for the International Criminal Court.Both men were murdered. Wafula said he had approached the US embassy to share the fugitive’s whereabouts but was told that nothing could be done “because they didn’t trust the Kenyans”.“They were afraid I would be killed.”There is no way of corroborating Wafula’s account. Four months after speaking to The , he died from a short illness. Although there is no suggestion of foul play, it was common knowledge in Kenya not to look too closely into Kabuga’s whereabouts.“Anyone who looked too closely, anyone who got a tip and tried to act on it tended not to live too long,” a Kenyan senator said. “He had powerful connections and deep pockets.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no one immune economic storm come1","story":"I blame this blasted weather. It lulls us into thinking that we are passing through a sunlit dreamtime, a holiday from reality after which things will get back to normal. But things won’t get back to normal. Our problems are only just starting.Even if, either because we find a cure or many more of us turn out to be immune than was realised, we are able to lift the restrictions speedily, the damage has been done.Our economy is in collapse. We have taken on debt at a rate not seen since 1945. A new generation is about to learn what mass unemployment feels like. How, in the circumstances, can we be so relaxed about extending the closures? When every day in lockdown adds billions to our debt, and months, even years, to the eventual recovery, how can so many of us think it reasonable to leave things as they are “until we can be absolutely sure”?Why, when other European countries are firing up their economies, do we remain the most timorous of all the electorates polled?The answer, I think, can be found in a YouGov survey last week which asked people whether the lockdown was having a positive or a negative effect on various aspects of their lives.Most of the results were unsurprising: people thought that the impact on their family relationships was positive, the impact on their social lives negative, the impact on their diet and exercise neutral. But there was one especially telling response.Asked about their personal income, only 26 per cent of respondents felt the lockdown had made them worse off (with 21 per cent saying the effect was positive and 50 per cent saying it was neutral).Think about those figures for a moment. Closing down most economic activity is bound to make almost everyone poorer. That should be an obvious, indeed indisputable, statement.Look around you. Businesses are already going under, two million more people have been driven on to benefits, and the sums we are borrowing, hour by hour, will condemn us to decades of tax rises, inflation or both – which will in turn hit our productivity.No one is immune. If you’re a pensioner, your pension will lose its value. If you’re a public sector worker, you’ll find that, as its tax take evaporates, the Government can’t afford to pay you.If you have savings, they will be inflated away. If you’re a student, you’ll be working off these debts for the rest of your life.​Britain, as a whole, is perhaps 25 per cent poorer. Yet, so far, few of us are feeling it. That 26 per cent figure is a reminder that our economy is an inverted pyramid resting on a relatively small number of profitable enterprises. The rest of the population – whether state employees on full pay or furloughed workers who, without travel or childcare costs, are no worse off – naturally find it easier to call for caution.“We need to put lives before the economy,” say the majority – as though the economy were some abstraction removed from human endeavour.Perhaps we can’t help thinking this way. We are flesh-and-blood creatures. We can picture getting sick much more easily than we can picture a fall in GDP.Only when that fall hits us directly, leaving us unable to afford the things we used to buy, will we understand that “the economy” is what we call the transactions people make to improve their lives.And, even then, we may struggle to link our misfortune to the closures we have spent the past two months demanding.Weather conditions along the lines of King Lear act three, scene two would be more appropriate. They might just give us a premonition of what is heading our way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy investigating leak aboard 3bn aircraft carrier hms","story":"The Royal Navy has launched an investigation following a leak aboard HMS Prince of Wales, its £3 billion aircraft carrier, while it was docked at a naval base.Video published on Facebook showed water pouring through the ceiling into an accommodation area of the 65,000-tonne warship. The leak is understood to have taken place on Friday while the £3bn warship was at Portsmouth Naval Base.A Royal Navy spokesman said: Following a minor issue with an internal system on HMS Prince of Wales, the ship\u0027s company were required to remove a small volume of water from the ship.An investigation into the cause is now under way but this will not affect the ship\u0027s programme.It is understood that the pipe was isolated quickly and the water was mopped up by the crew.The leak comes after sister ship HMS Queen Elizabeth had to cut short sea trials last July after a seal burst causing a large quantity of water to pour from a pipe and to flood through several decks.Following the incident, the ship\u0027s then commanding officer Captain Steve Moorhouse said it was safe and that in his experience leaks were a weekly problem for warships.HMS Prince of Wales has recently been testing its safety systems including the deployment of life rafts and emergency chutes while the Queen Elizabeth set sail from anchor off Gosport, Hampshire, on Friday to carry out sea trials off the south coast.The older of the two carriers had to delay its departure from Portsmouth last month to enable its 700-strong crew to be tested for Covid-19 of which two tested positive and were removed from the ship.The rest of the ship underwent a period of quarantine at sea prior to commencing the training exercises.Last month it was reported how residents had complained how noise and pollution from HMS Prince of Wales had kept them awake at night. Neighbours in Gosport, Hants, claimed the hum of the generators from warship was disturbing the neighbourhood.Resident Neil Sutton, 59, told the Portsmouth News: No resident in this long stretch of waterfront can escape the sound of this ship, particularly at night time.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"r rate reliable might reopening schools impact","story":"The Government is basing its lockdown release strategy on the reproduction, or ‘R’ rate, and has warned that if it goes above one, restrictions will remain in place.But how is it calculated? Is it reliable? And will schools reopening have a significant impact?The reproduction, or ‘R’ rate, is the number of people that a single infected person will go on to infect.Anything above one, means that each person will be passing the virus on to more than one person allowing the epidemic to grow exponentially. For example an ‘R’ rate of 1.5 would mean every 10 people who became infected, would infect 15 more people. Those 15, would, in turn, infect 22.5 people who would then pass the disease on to 33.7. The opposite is true if the ‘R’ rate is below one. The Government announced last week that it is somewhere between 0.7 and 1. Scientists cannot be completely accurate because different models are used to come up with the figures and they do not often agree.If it is at the lower end of the estimate — 0.7 — then every 10 people will infect seven others. Those seven will infect 3.5, and those 3.5 will infect 1.75. If the ‘R’ rate is at the higher end of one, then the disease has plateaued, so 10 people would infect 10 others, and the epidemic would neither increase nor decline.The ‘R’ rate is calculated by The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).However it is only an estimation and it is usually out of date because it relies on testing, admissions and death data. So there will always be a 14 to 21 day lag because people are infected weeks before they enter hospital, or die. Contact pattern surveys are also used to calculate how much people move around but these also tend to have a lag of around a week and are open to bias because they rely on self-reported behaviour. Household longitudinal surveys — which sample the same people repeatedly — allow a direct estimate of the infection rates, but these have only recently started by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and no long-term data is currently available.Therefore the current ‘R’ rate reflects the situation in Britain at the end of April. It is also crucial to look at the ‘R’ value alongside the actual number of people infected. For example, although the countrywide ‘R’ rate is between 0.7 and 1, Public Health England (PHE) modelling suggests that in London it could be as low as 0.4, with daily infections down to fewer than 24 a day, and critically, halving every 3.5 days.In London’s case, the virus could potentially stop spreading within the capital by the end of May.In contrast, the same study estimated that thousands of people are still being infected in the North East each day, where the ‘R’ rate could be at 0.8, and halving at a far slower rate, meaning that it will take longer to eliminate the disease in that area.The other problem is that the ‘R’ rate can vary not just regionally, but also by subsections of the population. Government scientists now believe that the epidemic is largely confined to care homes and hospitals and there is very little community transmission at all.“Nobody catches it by passing someone on the street,” said one Government expert. “That isn’t how you get it. This is now epidemic of care homes and hospitals.” There are fears that reopening schools will have a big impact on transmissions, potentially sending the ‘R’ rate above one again, but there is little evidence to show that will happen.Research published in April, by University College London (UCL), suggested that schools only play a small role in transmission, perhaps accounting for two to four per cent of deaths and 10 per cent of the ‘R’-rate. Those estimates were based on the entire school population without extra measures, such as social distancing, so the impact is likely to be even smaller with class sizes restricted to 15 and communal tables replaced by traditional single desks.There is also no evidence that those schools which stayed open for the children of key workers have seen extra infections in their communities.The Chief Scientist of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Dr Soumya Swaminathan also said she did not think reopening schools would pose a threat of increased infections.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show Dr Swaminathan, who specialises in paediatrics, said: “Children don’t seem to be getting seriously ill from this infection.“We do know that children are capable of getting the infection, but there’s less data on how effectively they are able to spread it to others. What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.“Where there have been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms and it’s often been associated with an adult, who has the infection and who has spread it. The risks to children are extremely low.”Schools were closed in Britain on March 20 and a report published by Imperial College on March 30 suggested that might have taken the ‘R’ rate down from three to just above two.However only nursery, Year 1 and Year 6 are going back to begin with which means the impact is likely to be far less.Prof Matt Keeling, Professor of Populations and Disease, at the University of Warwick, said: “Any form of additional mixing will inevitably lead to an increase in ‘R’, and hence more cases — however, all the current evidence suggests that children are not suffering substantially from this pandemic.  “This could be because they are less susceptible or because they show fewer symptoms when infected, there is no firm scientific data to determine which of these is true.  This means that opening some school classes is unlikely to push ‘R’ above one a conclusion supported by our mathematical modelling studies.“The idea of only half the children being in school should mean that classes can be half the size, which will help with social distancing, further preventing a substantial rise in ‘R’.”Some experts believe the ‘R’ rate should not be used at all to determine policy.Prof Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, who also sits on Sage, said: “The ‘R’ rate shouldn’t be a policy objective. It’s not the direct measure of the public health burden, it’s not a direct measure of capacity. It restricts your options very substantially.“The R being below one for the whole country is meaningless when in fact when it can be different in different portions of the population,“Particularly now we have a situation where it’s almost certainly below 1 for the whole country, but is around 1 or higher in care homes. Now if you think about it that’s the wrong way round.“The public health implications of ‘R’ greater than one are very different in hospitals than in the general population and the elderly and specific regions and having this single number directs policies.”Prof Woolhouse said that the regional lifting of lockdown had been discussed by those advising the Government.“It’s a discussion point, he said. “As I understand they prefer to move forward in the UK as one but the devolved administrations are doing things independently so there is an argument.“There may be epidemiological circumstances where it would be justified to relax the region of the UK if the R value was lower.”A Government source said: “We have always been clear that loosening depends on ‘R’ being below 1. “Without that, we risk seeing the kind of exponential growth we faced at the height of the pandemic. R must be below 1 for further opening up of society.”Prof Saul Faust, Professor of Paediatric Immunology \u0026amp Infectious Diseases, University of Southampton, said: “Society has to reopen, children need to return to school as there are negatives for many of having to stay at home and we need to be able study transmission dynamics in all ages to help us learn how to manage this virus.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/03/16/gettyimages-691594048.jpg","title":"music industry royalties small bands income lockdown coronavirus weddings streaming revenues","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The legendary Captain Ska made just £20k from its top 10 hit ‘Liar Liar’.

That’s more than twice as bad as the ADB forecast in April.However, government measures to mitigate the economic impact could reduce that figure by as much as 40 per cent, ADB’s chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs some countries, including the UK, lay out plans to ease lockdowns and get more people back to work, Mr Sawada cautioned that containing the pandemic is key to reducing the economic cost. Testing, tracing, isolation, effective social distancing, and securing protective and medical equipment are all “essential elements” of containing Covid-19, he said.

For all of this, having adequate data and information is key.”His words came as the UK government faced criticism from scientists over its easing of lockdown restrictions this week.The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Tuesday that the UK faces “inevitable” future lockdowns if the government implements its “potentially dangerous” coronavirus strategy.Ministers laid out plans this week to get sectors including construction and manufacturing back to work, and to restart the housing market.However, the government was accused of confusing people with it’s new message to “stay alert”, replacing a previous instruction to “stay at home”.The number of deaths in the UK has fallen in recent days but the Independent Sage, an alternative to the government’s official scientific advisory panel, said numbers of infections were still too high to implement an effective policy of tracking, tracing and isolating cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?He also pointed to the importance of government support for struggling families and businesses to lessen the adverse effects of the pandemic and to avoid long-term consequences for growth and development.“Rapid and effective containment will allow for a faster recovery,” he said. “Then, it is critical to identify industries and occupations in terms of essentiality and economic importance, and their ability to operate safely with adequate social distancing.“Finally, governments should reopen the economy sequentially, balancing health risks and economic considerations, and being ready to tighten if outbreaks reoccur. For all of this, having adequate data and information is key.”His words came as the UK government faced criticism from scientists over its easing of lockdown restrictions this week.The Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned on Tuesday that the UK faces “inevitable” future lockdowns if the government implements its “potentially dangerous” coronavirus strategy.Ministers laid out plans this week to get sectors including construction and manufacturing back to work, and to restart the housing market.However, the government was accused of confusing people with it’s new message to “stay alert”, replacing a previous instruction to “stay at home”.The number of deaths in the UK has fallen in recent days but the Independent Sage, an alternative to the government’s official scientific advisory panel, said numbers of infections were still too high to implement an effective policy of tracking, tracing and isolating cases.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The comments came after a CNBC report that said multiple anonymous AI researchers said they saw Musk’s views on the technology as inappropriate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn AI executive speaking to CNBC, who asked to remain anonymous because their company may work for one of Musk’s businesses, said that “A large proportion of the community think he’s a negative distraction.”He is sensationalist, he veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the AGI (artificial general intelligence) agenda. Whilst his very real accomplishments are acknowledged, his loose remarks lead to the general public having an unrealistic understanding of the state of AI maturity.”It’s time to draw the curtain on celebrity businessmen like Musk“AGI” stands for “artificial general intelligence,” which is the hypothetical benchmark whereby a machine can learn anything that a human being could. This is distinct from \u0027standard\u0027 artificial intelligence, which is when a machine is capable of carrying out a task like a human could, such as voice recognition in Siri or Alexa.Another specialised focused on speech recognition said that Musk is “not always looked upon favourably,” while an AI researcher at a UK university said that they “instinctively fall on dislike, because he makes up such nonsense.”“But then he delivers such extraordinary things. It always leaves me wondering, does he know what he’s doing? Is all the visionary stuff just a trick to get an innovative thing to market?” they continued.On Twitter, Pesenti said that many people in the AI community would be happy to criticise Musk publicly, stating that Musk “has no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI. There is no such thing as AGI and we are nowhere near matching human intelligence.”While Facebook team declined to give an official comment, Pesenti said that it was his “personal opinion” but that others at the company – including Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and a Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Edward Grefenstette, a Facebook AI Research Scientist – agreed.LeCun quote-tweeted Musk’s disparaging comment, saying that Tesla’s engineers still needed access to Facebook’s PyTorch to develop their products. PyTorch is a free, open source machine learning library primarily developed by Facebok’s AI Research lab.The researchers, Tesla, and SpaceX were contacted by The Independent for comment.

The BBC hosted a TV special on the night of the would-be grand final on 16 May titled Eurovision: Come Together, as part of a wider celebration taking place all this week. The Come Together show was hosted by Graham Norton it reflected on the UK’s best Eurovision moments, past and present, and was ultimately won by Eurovision stars ABBA and their performance of “Waterloo”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe BBC organised a number of shows to lift the spirits of Eurovision fans everywhere, starting with...In February, BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat began filming a documentary that follows the UK’s Eurovision entrant, James Newman, through rehearsals, as well as backstage during the live debut of his Eurovision song, “My Last Breath”.The documentary jumps to when the contest was cancelled, and interviews Newman as he reveals what the cancellation means for him. Other contestants speak about how their experiences of Eurovision differ, and what their future plans are.Eurovision 2020: The Cancelled Coronavirus Year is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer, and on the BBC Newsbeat YouTube channel.Eurovision at 60In 2015, Eurovision at 60 aired on BBC to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the song contest. It includes interviews with Graham Norton, Eurovision champion Conchita Wurst, and the late Sir Terry Wogan.Eurovision viewers moved to tears as monuments around Europe light upABBA crowned the UK’s favourite ever act at Eurovision: Come TogetherEurovision Song Contest winners ranked from worst to bestFifty years ago, an 18-year-old schoolgirl left the Bogside in Ireland and journeyed to Amsterdam to represent her country in the 15th Eurovision Song Contest. Against the odds, she won! Dana: The Original Derry Girl looks back at the life of Dana, and how she became Ireland’s first-ever Eurovision winnerGraham Norton hosted Eurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gave the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The event was ultimately won by ABBA performing “Waterloo”.Right after the Come Together show you’ll get to watch Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, which will honour all of the 41 songs that would have competed in the 2020 contest in Rotterdam.This non-competitive show was broadcast across Europe, just like the usual contest, with a special hosted by the original Dutch presenters who were supposed to present the live event this year: Chantal Janzen, Edsilia Rombley, and Jan Smit from the Netherlands. Graham Norton provided additional commentary. A virtual singalong also took place, with fans dressing up in costume and forming a huge Eurovision choir, which will perform “What’s Another Year”, Ireland’s winning song originally performed by Johnny Logan.The liveblog is now closedBBC show Come Together includes performances by Mahmood and Bucks FizzSee a ranking of every Eurovision winner ever!Vote for your favourite performanceRead about the Russell Crowe-approved Iceland representativesHere\u0027s what\u0027s been happening over the past couple of months.As an alternative to the Song Contest, our Eurovision Correspondent Rob Holley has\u0026nbspbeen running #EurovisionAgain watch-a-longs on Saturday nights, where disappointed\u0026nbspfans of the contest have been simulcasting contests from years past, with legendary ESC participants tweeting along too. Katrina (of the Waves), Alexander Rybak and Dami Im have all dipped in to the #EurovisionAgain twitter stream, providing insights into their time at the world’s biggest pop party.The EBU have enjoyed the fan-run project some much that they’ve started to source classic contests (the pre-2004 Eurovisions are usually mired in complex copyright conundrums, but the original broadcasters have been happy to help during these weird times) to debut them on the official Eurovision YouTube channel! Nearly 200,000 uses of #EurovisionAgain have made it the most popular Twitter trending topic on a Saturday night, dwarfing primetime shows like Britain’s Got Talent on the popular social media platform.Rob says: “It’s really been great for the fans. We’ve been able to e deep in to nostalgia while raising loads of money for some really brilliant charities”.As well as tweeting along, fans have raised over £14,000 for the charities Mermaids, Terrence Higgins Trust and Stonewall, often chipping in a tenner on a weekly basis in return for being entertained. On top of watching the show, Rob and friends also open the virtual phone lines and run a vote which attracts thousands of participants, and often gives a scoring outcome different to the original broadcast.“Schlager a Carola knocked Lordi off the Athens 2006 podium, which I wasn’t happy about - but Scooch did jump 14 places at our screening on Helsinki 2007, so there is an amount of justice being dished out, Rob says.\u0026nbspInstead of reporting from Rotterdam for the Independent, Rob has been publishing his interviews with 2020 participants as the podcast VISION AGAIN, for those wanting to know what the disappointed acts thought of their chances and whether they’ll be invited back.“It’s been really great and I’ve been lucky to get some of the biggest names onto the podcast. I chatted to Iceland’s Daði Freyr, favourite to win with Think About Things, who said he’d be interested to compete at 2021 should he be asked and the right song comes around, he says.\u0026nbsp“Similarly, UK act James Newman also wants a shot too –\u0026nbsphe’s busy gearing up to release his new single \u0027Enough\u0027, but Eurovision remains the goal, and getting way ahead of the game is Ireland’s Lesley Roy, who told me she’s already started plotting an absolute banger for next year. With an extra 12 months under their belts to write epic entries, expect 2021 to blast away all the disappointment of Eurovision being cancelled.”But it’s not all great news: “Other acts like The Mamas from Sweden won’t necessarily be gifted a golden ticket because the national final selection shows are too big not to go ahead., Rob explains. Sweden’s Melodifestivalen is just this huge pop behemoth, so if they want to go to Rotterdam they have to compete again.So what\u0027s actually happening at 6.25pm?Graham Norton is hosting\u0026nbspEurovision: Come Together, a one-off TV special that gives the UK a chance to vote for their favourite Eurovision performances.The choices will come from a short list of artists who will all give virtual performances on the night, and\u0026nbspthe public will be given the chance to vote for their favourites.A reminder of WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING tonight:\u0026nbspQuite a lot, actually, starting with Eurovision: Come Together at 6.25pm on BBC1. The show is a celebration of Eurovision past and present presented by Graham Norton, and will include a vote on your favourite out of a short list of contestants (also past and present).Right after that there\u0027s Europe Shine a Light, a live broadcast which the European Broadcasting Union is airing\u0026nbspin 45 countries + as an online show.There\u0027s no official competition this year, but you can bet I\u0027m going to be passing judgement on each and every one of the performances with my usual sparkling wit.Now we\u0027re seeing Dami Im and her performance of ‘Sound of Silence’, which won the jury vote for Australia in 2016...\u0026nbspbut then came fourth in the public vote and ended up second overall... Dami ultimately lost to Ukraine, who didn’t win either vote. Yes, the voting system is mad and it was a weird year.Feel free to compensate by voting for her (and that incredible dress) this year instead.The A-Z of EurovisionYes, there’s more! Rylan Clark-Neal narrated The A-Z of Eurovision at 10pm on Saturday 16 May, this time on BBC2. The special took us through all of the disasters, outlandish costumes and other memorable moments that have taken place over 65 years of Eurovision.Hosted by Steve Wright, this Eurovision-themed special was originally shown at the beginning of the 2007 edition of the competition.Catchup with all of the 2020 Eurovision broadcasts on YouTube and BBC iPlayer.

It is my opinion that this is a feasible scenario.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis hopeful comments come days after a new study in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, using local authority “R” transmission rate data, estimated some 19 million people are “likely” to have already contracted the virus in the UK.Epidemiologists’ efforts to surmise and monitor the true spread of the virus have been hindered by the government’s decision to abandon widespread testing and contact-tracing in mid-March.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?While hopes for a return to what ministers have dubbed a “new normal” are pinned to the development of extensive testing and contact-tracing programmes, many have suggested that a full return to pre-outbreak freedoms will only be truly possible with the advent of a vaccine.Boris Johnson last weekend stressed that the “only feasible long-term solution lies with a vaccine or drug-based treatment”, which he said may be more than a year away, admitting: “In a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine.”Recent polling by Opinium suggests the public are similarly pinning their hopes on a vaccine. Researchers found more than a quarter of UK respondents said they would not feel comfortable taking public transport until a vaccine is found. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has previously said that the government is “throwing everything” at finding a vaccine, and two leading development projects at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have received at least £42.5m to support their vaccine trials.Oxford’s Professor Sir John Bell, a member of the government’s coronavirus taskforce, revealed this week that the initial results could be ready by June. The team hope to produce one million doses of the resulting vaccine by September, if successful.Writing on Twitter, Prof Sikora – who is currently chief medical officer at Rutherford Health – caveated his hopeful comments with the statement: “Nobody is claiming to know what will happen for sure – I believe in an unknown situation this is a possibility.“We need to continue to keep our distance and hope the numbers continue to improve.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The accords are named in keeping with the Artemis programme, which is the plan to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024.They would include a commitment to be transparent in their work, to only explore space for “peaceful purposes”, and to guarantee they would work together to save any astronauts that came into danger during a mission.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa was explicit that the agreements would be made in keeping with the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which currently sets the legal framework for space exploration. That requires a set of commitments from countries which are intended to ensure that space missions are as safe and transparent as possible.But the new Artemis Accords go further than those commitments, requiring more detailed principles from the countries prepared to work with the US to head to the moon and beyond.Nasa reveals Tesla car that will drive astronauts to new launch“While Nasa is leading the Artemis programme, international partnerships will play a key role in achieving a sustainable and robust presence on the moon while preparing to conduct a historic human mission to Mars,” the agency said on its website.“With numerous countries and private sector players conducting missions and operations in cislunar space, it’s critical to establish a common set of principles to govern the civil exploration and use of outer space.”In full, the principles are that any mission should be conducted with peaceful purposes should be transparent and use technology that is interoperable and conforms to open, international standards that everyone can use. International partners also have to agree to provide emergency assistance to astronauts in trouble publicly register any space objects release the scientific data they gather protect the heritage of historic space artefacts gather resources according to international agreements not harmfully interfere with other missions and dispose of any debris or spacecraft responsibly.When drafts of the accords were leaked earlier this month, they attracted ire from Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos. He suggested on Twitter that the US was planning to invade the moon like it had Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the accords would be a way of building a coalition of other countries that would allow for it to take over the lunar surface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Representatives also indicated that they hope for Russia to sign a version of the accords.As well as drawing criticism from Russia, the accords appear to be something of a rebuke to the Chinese space programme, which has traditionally been less transparent than the US. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine explicitly referenced the problems around its recent rocket launch as an example of where the accords could help.“The empty core stage of the Long March 5B, weighing nearly 20 tons, was in an uncontrolled free fall along a path that carried it over Los Angeles and other densely populated areas,” Mr Bridenstine told Ars Technica.“I can think of no better example of why we need the Artemis Accords. It’s vital for the US to lead and establish norms of behaviour against such irresponsible activities. Space exploration should inspire hope and wonder, not fear and danger.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up.

I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was an 81 per cent increase in emergency food parcels given out during the last two weeks of March compared to the same period in 2019.Warning that the enormous level of need was likely to continue, she said: “If would be false of me to say we can continue to meet indefinitely an unspecified level of increased demand.”How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is seeking to raise £10m for the food surplus charity The Felix Project so it can provide food for NHS staff, the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies or remain stuck at home for health reasons.The Trussell Trust chief said food aid charities had done “incredible work” since the beginning of the outbreak, and said more than 50 per cent of food banks had adapted to the lockdown by doing home deliveries.However, Ms Revie argued that unless the government strengthened the financial safety net, the UK would continue to see “the kind of destitution that drives people to food banks”.She added: “The problem is people falling into financial hardship. The answer to financial hardship is not food. We are treating one symptom of an underlying problem … The issue we must be focusing on reducing the flow of people into foodbanks.”Advocating a “cash-first approach”, Ms Revie said: “If we’re identifying families in financial hardship ⁠– the most straightforward and dignified response is to provide them with the cash.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together.

You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if, for any reason, there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.”He added: “We can’t have a situation where we keep our economy, our schools and our public services continually closed down, because the health consequences of doing so would be malign as well.Labour is pressing the government to publish the scientific evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools, and to keep talking to unions, teachers and councils to ensure parents can be confident their children will be safe if they return.Rachel Reeves, shadow Cabinet Office minister, told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The government have got a lot more work to do to give that confidence that it will be safe to send children back in two weeks’ time.“The government have got two weeks to get this right. They haven’t approached this in the right way so far.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they have received backing for their cautious approach from the British Medical Association, while local authorities including Liverpool and Hartlepool have said they will not reopen schools on 1 June unless they are absolutely confident it is safe to do so.Asked for his advice to those opposing a return to classrooms next month, Mr Gove said: “I respectfully ask them to think again, to broaden the range of the scientific advice that they look at.“I know the BMA has the best interests of its members at heart, but actually the clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen accompanied by social distancing.”The former education secretary added: “Children only have one chance at education. Over the past decade we have made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that backwards.“If you really care about children, you will want them to be in school, you will want them to be learning, you will want them to have opportunities. Look to your responsibilities.”Ms Reeves said that parents and teachers’ anxieties would be “a lot less” if the government had got in place a programme for widespread coronavirus testing, followed by tracing of contacts of those infected and isolation of those who test positive.Mr Gove announced today that more than 17,000 of the government’s planned army of 18,000 contact tracers have now been recruited and said the authorities were “on course” to begin the programme by the end of this month.Ms Reeves said: “Government need to put in place some of the measures to improve confidence and that includes the test, trace and isolate strategy. The government abandoned that back in the middle of March. That was a mistake.”She added: “We want to see our children in the classroom, but to do that in a safe way two things need to happen. First of all, the government needs to work with parents, teachers and their unions to make sure that the new plans have the confidence of everybody so that parents feel confident to send their children to school.“But also we need more transparency from government.  The prime minister said last Sunday that all the decisions that are going to be made about easing lockdown will be based on the science and here we are, a week later, and those details have not been published and that is a cause for concern and adds to the anxiety amongst teachers and teaching staff and parents about the safety.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We welcome the fact that Michael Gove ... acknowledged unions have proper concerns for the health and safety of school staff, children and their families.“We stand ready to engage this week, with the publication of Sage’s advice and underlying modelling and data and with some understanding of how the government intends to assess the progress on its five tests.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, suggested the timetable for schools reopening should vary according to the R value – recording the average number of people infected by each coronavirus patient – in different regions of England.The former Labour MP warned that the prime minister could fracture national unity unless he listens to concerns that the lifting of lockdown measures is coming too quickly for the north.Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “People do not have the R information at the moment. They can get it, but it’s not formally published by the government.“There’s a very different picture in the north, particularly in the northeast, where the R is the highest, so I can understand concerns.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He announced that six drugs to treat coronavirus have now entered initial live clinical trials as part of a UK study, and will move on to larger-scale trials if results are positive.The announcement comes after Mr Sharma today committed £93m to fast-track the construction of a vaccine manufacture centre in Oxfordshire, now due to open 12 months early in summer 2021 with the potential to produce enough doses for the entire UK population in the space of six months, and a further £38m for a rapid deployment facility to allow production at scale from this summer.Mr Sharma said that a global licensing agreement struck between Oxford and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca would allow 30 million doses of the vaccine to be made available for the UK in September if it proves effective, as part of an eventual 100 million doses.Created with Sketch.Giving birth during the coronavirus outbreak Show all 23Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nancy Pedroza, 27, who is

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet. And these are Peruvian penguins, so we were speaking a bit in Spanish, and they really appreciated art history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 28 patients are still in hospital, 95 have been discharged and nearly 1,000 close contacts are under observation.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a bid to prevent the virus from spreading further, the majority of transport to 1,205 villages and their surrounding areas has also been halted, NBC News reported officials as saying, in a likely reference to measures imposed last weekend.Shulan’s mayor, Jin Hua, told a press conference on Saturday that fresh measures had been “strictly implemented in accordance with the central government’s decision-making and the requirements of provinces and cities”.

China’s state-run press agency Xinhua reported 40,000 tests have been carried out so far.More than 500 medical staff also rushed to neighbouring Jilin City to offer their assistance on Sunday as the alert level was raised from medium to high, state-affiliated media reported.Cluster infections in the city have seen some 8,000 people quarantined, according to the Global Times, after a partial lockdown was reimposed on the city on Wednesday, with long-distance public transport stopped, mass gatherings banned and indoor public venues closed.China’s vice premier Sun Chunlan – who became the face of efforts to manage Wuhan’s Covid-19 response – visited the province this weekend, demanding local authorities step up their efforts to tackle the new outbreak.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domestic flights have also resumed to 60 per cent of pre-crisis levels, according to the country’s civil aviation regulator, with numerous tourist sites reopening, such as Beijing’s Forbidden City and Shanghai’s Disneyland resort.Meanwhile, Reuters reports that China and South Korea have both consulted Japan about loosening border controls on some travellers to help revive business activities between the three nations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Afghans have proven that they are committed to their national interests with common thinking, Mr Ghani said during the signing ceremony.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the coming days, we hope that with unity and cooperation, we will be able to provide the ground for a ceasefire and lasting peace, he added.Discussions over the final sticking points including the allocation of some key posts had been underway throughout the day, three sources said.Thanks to the Taliban and Covid-19 – Afghanistan is facing a dark timeAbdullah had wanted to control a major portfolio such as finance or foreign affairs, and while Mr Ghani has not agreed to this, he could offer control of the interior ministry, sources said shortly before the deal was signed.It was not immediately clear which ministries each camp controlled after the agreement was struck.Washington has been frustrated by the growing impasse between the two men, even after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to Kabul in March to mediate. It had announced a plan to cut $1 billion (£830 million) in aid because the men could not agree.Mr Pompeo welcomed the agreement but chided Mr Ghani and Mr Abdullah for taking so long. He said the United States looked forward to prompt intra-Afghan talks and a political settlement.Secretary Pompeo noted that he regretted the time lost during the political impasse, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.It was not clear whether Sunday\u0027s agreement would result in the aid commitment being reinstated. Afghanistan is facing growing fiscal pressures, with tax revenues falling and foreign aid pledges due this year expected to shrink.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 13 March, Poland closed its borders due to the ongoing pandemic of the Covid-19 and has extended the measure until at least 11 AprilNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed the deal and called on the Taliban to reduce violence and for all sides to work towards peace.Officials say a deal between Mr Ghani and Mr Abdullah is crucial to launching peace talks, as Abdullah\u0027s camp represents much of the country\u0027s north-west.But the talks face a number of stark challenges, as violence in the country increases. An attack on a Kabul maternity ward this week prompted Mr Ghani to switch the military to an offensive stance against insurgent groups.The Taliban has denied involvement in the attack, but the government has remained sceptical and angry at ongoing Taliban attacks against the Afghan military, fraying the momentum for peace talks, which were due to start in March.US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that a new date for intra-Afghan peace talks was under discussion, and that he would soon travel to the region and try to encourage a reduction in violence.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

With an expected 36 ministers and 16 deputies, it will be the most bloated front bench in Israeli political history.The pair decided in April to set aside their differences to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic chaos, agreeing a power-sharing deal that will see Mr Netanyahu govern for the first 18 months and Mr Gantz take over for the second.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut opponents fear the newly created “alternate prime minister” position could allow Israel’s longest-standing leader to remain in office after the swap and throughout his looming corruption trial, which starts next week.There are also deep suspicions about whether Mr Netanyahu will maintain his side of the bargain and ultimately cede control to Mr Gantz.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Healthcare workers, nurses and doctors, unified under the movement called Take Care of Care wearing face masks protest against the Belgian authorities\u0027 management of the coronavirus crisis, at the MontLegia CHC HospitalA girl watches over goats on the banks of the Dal Lake during rainfall in SrinagarLife-size cardboard figures with photos of football fans are positioned on the stands of Borussia Moenchengladbach\u0027s football stadium for their next game, which will be played without spectators, due to the coronavirus outbreak in GermanyNurses wearing face masks take part in an event held to mark International Nurses Day, at Wuhan Tongji Hospital in ChinaIraqi protesters gather on the Al-Jumhuriyah bridge in the capital Baghdad during an anti-government demonstration.

The complete contempt for the crisis facing the Israeli public.”Mr Lapid and Mr Gantz had previously been allies, but their partnership collapsed after Mr Gantz abandoned his central pledge not to serve under Mr Netanyahu due to the looming criminal trial.Rowing back on this pledge and splitting his own centrist Blue and White party in the process, Mr Gantz had argued that teaming up with Mr Netanyahu offered the country its only way out of stalemate at a time of crisis.In his speech to parliament, Mr Netanyahu also acknowledged that compromises had been made, but said a fourth election would have been far more devastating alternative, after more than 500 days of political upheaval.“The public wants a unity government and this is what the public is getting today,” he said. “We chose to serve the country together.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Others say the sheer size of the operation is bound to lead to errors. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review.She also added that its plausible restrictions could be in place for longer than that.This is the first time the UK and Europe has had to deal with a pandemic on this scale since the outbreak of Spanish Flu in  that killed around  million people and infected  per cent of the world population.Weve had a few close calls with illnesses like swine flu in -, but it wasnt on the same scale as coronavirus.However, the reason we are in lockdown now is that we have a better understanding of how the pathogens work and what we need to do to stop them.China implemented what was then the largest quarantine in human history to try to contain the coronavirus, locking down at least  cities at the end of January.The lockdown on the eight-million-strong city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, ended on April .Wuhan was completely barricaded, with people literally being welded into their homes.Six European countries in Europe - Spain, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic - who have previously imposed restrictions are beginning to lt lockdown measures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Alok Sharma said freight is being looked at as one of the exemptions to a quarantine system that is due to launch in the next two weeks. He told the daily No press conference: I recognise that the quarantining measures will put restrictions on businesspeople being able to travel. We will be setting out shortly the exemptions. One of the exemptions we have talked about is people who are bringing freight in, so freight drivers. It comes as the UK government prepares to force all arrivals at all ports and airports to go into self-isolation for  days, starting in a few weeks. People will be ordered to give the address they are quarantining at, andthey do not, could be forced into a government-run quarantine facility. Itaposs understood officials are looking at exemptions for some people who arrive to the UK, especially from France through the Channel Tunnel or Eurostar. But government sources have said those exceptions will be tightly drawn, to include freight drivers or scientists working on the pandemic. That means holidaymakers - including any Brits ing home - are unlikely to be exempt from quarantinethey go on a trip to France.  The UK lockdown is still largely in place and the Foreign Office advises against all non-essential travel, anywhere in the world. Exemptions to the quarantine policy, which Mr Sharma said would be limited, will be published in the coming days. And he stopped well short of saying there would be an exemption for all people coming from France. He said: There have been discussions between the Prime Minister and President Macron, when details become available we will set them out.

It is an early step in trying to solve one of the great answered questions about the virus - one which will be crucial as lockdown eases.If having coronavirus makes you immune to getting it again, the government could use a system of immunity passports to get people back to work.

Experts also warn employers could discriminate on the basis of immunity status or people could attempt to game the system, or get a  result. However, for now such systems are simply not an option due to the lack of knowledge about immunity. Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye today said he could be in favour of immunity passports - but onlyplans existed similarly across the world.

The alert comes in the first report from the John Mills Institute for Prosperity, launched by the multimillionaire shopping channel tycoon and ex-Labour donor. His think tank aims to spark a revival in “left-behind” parts of the country, such as industrial heartlands and coastal towns.They include constituencies which formed the “Red Wall” – Labour strongholds seized by the Conservatives at last Decemberaposs election. Manufacturing makes up less than % of the UK economy, but the study calls for that to rise to %. Boosting output would help less well-off regions sell more goods to the rest of world, the Institute says. Otherwise, it fears living standards may be “signicantly lower in  than in  – leaving today’s generations the worst off”. Blasting “decades of deindustrialisation”, Mr Mills told the Mirror: “Never before have we faced an economic challenge of this magnitude, but our prospects for recovery have been made more bleak by a decade of low growth and a deeply unbalanced economy.  “When we have defeated this virus, the UK government must begin to create a more competitive and favourable environment for British manufacturers. “Increased private sector investment in mechanisation, technology and power will produce a largerof GDP growth than other sectors.” He said the “manufacturing industry has been depleted and left unable to compete globally”. Backing the report, former Labour minister Caroline Flint who said: “Facing the greatest period of uncertainty in our letimes, in a Britain that doesn’t train enough, invest enough or make enough, there is no certainty of a fair or sure recovery.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “It is absolutely safe,” then said the only way to be sure was to “stay at home” as there is “always, always... a risk”. Teaching unions fear it is unsafe for pupils and staff to go back to school on June . And Labour wants the test and trace system to be put in place before schools .Teachers demanded clarity on the safety of going back to school after Michael Gove plunged the Government’s lockdown exit strategy into further confusion.The Cabinet Office Minister initially promised teachers would be safe from Covid- as a phasedfor primary school kids starts on June . But seconds later he backtracked – admitting the only way to completely avoid infection was to stay at home. The standoff between the Government and teaching unions intensied as Hartlepool council in Co Durham joined Liverpool in saying its schools will remain shut as cases locally continue to increase. Labour and teaching unions insist a testing and tracking system should be a precondition for schools reopening, so that inidual outbreaks can be controlled. But testing again fell below the , daily target, with , tests carried out or dispatched in the  hours to am on Sunday. It came as sunseekers flocked to beaches over the weekend after a partial loosening of lockdown restrictions, despite the UK death toll rising by  to , on Sunday. Beaches including Southend in Essex were packed, cars crammed into a car park at Durdle Door, Dorset, and hundreds of bikers were among visitors to Matlock Bath, Derbys. The rush came despite pleas not to flock to hotspots after the “stay local” rule was lted in England. Asked about teachers’ safety, Mr Gove told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Yes, teachers will be safe in schools... “Some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to , absolutely safe for teachers and other staff toas well.”  But askedhe could guarantee no teacher would be infected as a result of ing to the classroom, he said: “The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely.There is always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk, but... it’s extremely unlikely any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak, andfor any reason there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.” Teachers’ unions have said they will provide health and safety guidance for their members so they can saythey feel it is too dangerous to work. But Mr Gove said: “The clear scientic and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen accompanied with social distancing. Children only have one chance at education. Over the last decade we have made signicant strides in closing the gap between the richest and poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that at risk.” He said the Government was on track to meet its target of , contact tracers by next week, with , now recruited. But last week, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said just , had signed up. Hartlepool leaders said: “Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool borough council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday st June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we will be taking a measured and cautious approach.” Liverpool has confirmed that its schools will only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on June . Sunderland City Council leader Graeme Miller described the lockdown changes as “nonsense”. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham warned: “”Nervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pubs could start selling food","story":"NewsPubs could start selling food and drink from street stalls within weeksThe government is looking at making clear pubs, cafes or restaurants can set up market stalls - but theres no sign beer gardens will reopenShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPunters queuing outside a Liverpool pub which has already started selling takeaway lockdown pints \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sources confirmed ministers are looking at letting firms set up aposmarket-styleapos stalls for takeaways within weeks. There is a big condition, though - these firms must have a licence for tables and chairs at the front of their premises. The plan, which is still being considered, could let some pubs creak slowly back into le before they can actually open their doors. Existing plans say pubs, cafes and restaurants could start to reopen from July, but only limited open-air dining areas would be included in this first wave. Sources have made clear pubs have next to no chance of reopening fully in July, and may not even open in July at all. So according to the Sunday , Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick will issue guidance to give pubs a tiny bit more freedom.The guidance will reportedly say shops, restaurants and pubs can set up stalls out front - but only in areas where they already have a licence to place tables and chairs. A Whitehall source said it could lead to a more vibrant style of continental town centres in the summer. Pubs, cafes and restaurants are already able to run as takeaways during the pandemic. And separately, outdoor market stalls that sell food are already allowed to carry on running. However, these two dferent rules have not been formally combined until now. But those hoping for aof beer gardens will be left disappointed.  There is still no sign that any seating areas of any kind, even outdoors, will reopen at all before July. Instead, people might be expected to take their food or drink and move away to a public open space like a park, where they are allowed to sit down. People must still stay two metres apart and gatherings of more than two are banned unless youaposre from the same household. If two people from dferent households meet, they must sit two metres apart.It seems likely any guidance would only apply to England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all set out their own lockdown easing plans. It comes despite pubs and trade bodies calling on the Government to go further and let them open beer gardens, as long as tables are spread out. Peter Borg-Neal, founder of Oakman Inns, told the Mirror last week: “We could use free standing screens to separate tables, or use a natural gap of two metres, have staggered bookings, contactless payments and handwash stations. “Simple common sense, carefully applied with trained staff should work.” Pub, cafe and restaurants will only begin after England enters step three of easing the lockdown. Step one happened in the last week, and involved being able to exercise unlimited times per day and sit still in an open space.

Labour peer Lord George Foulkes, who was a minister when the benefit was introduced in November , urged the Tories to honour a pledge to protect free licences.He said: “This year we will mark the th anniversary of the introduction of the concessionary TV licence for over-s. “We should be celebrating how this progressive Labour policy has helped reduce pensioner poverty and combat loneliness. “It should not be the year we mark its end.”  The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until . But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the leline from June , under a deal agreed in . The corporation is restricting eligibility to OAPs who receive Pension Credit. It says keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -. Some . million pensioner households must fork out £. a year from August .Curbs were due to come into effect on June  but were delayed for two months because of the coronavirus outbreak.Writing exclusively for the Mirror, Lord Foulkes, , urged ministers to save the benefit.  He says: “If they have any compassion at all, they should now honour their manesto promise and keep the concession indefinitely – not just because it makes sense but, as the Conservatives put it themselves, to promise our over-s aposthe security and dignity they deserveapos.” He will tackle the Government over free licences in the House of Lords on June . Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: “To start charging the over-s now on the th anniversary of free TV licences would be an insult to all those older people who are already struggling with the loneliness and isolation that this lockdown is creating and will continue to do for months to come, as well as having to dig deep to find the finances to pay for it.”  Bectu broadcasting union chief Philippa Childs said: “The -year anniversary of free licence fees for the over-s is a landmark that we should, as a nation, be celebrating. “Instead the Conservative Government has forced the BBC to take on this cost, abdicating its responsibility for what is essentially a welfare benefit. “The Government must take back responsibility for funding free licences for all over-s.” The Silver Voices campaign group highlighted tributes offered to war veterans last weekend as the Government marked the th anniversary of VE Day. Pointing out over-s were alive at the end of the war, director Dennis Reed said: “For  years they have had the right to free TV licences in recognition of their long contributions to society and the low level of the state pension. “The VE Day generation need the threat of losing their free licence on August  like a kick in the teeth.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma told the public that the country is moving toward level three on the five-tier Covid alert system - which would see some of the strictest measures reduced. Since the lockdown was put in place on March , it has been in level four - meaning the threat is classed as severe. Level three means it is classed as substantial. But Mr Sharma warned that bringing the country back to normal must be done in careful steps in order to avoid a second peak of cases. He said at todayaposs daily Downing Street briefing - in which he confirmed that the Covid- death toll has risen by a further  - that progress was being made. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Describing five threat levels - with five being the most severe and one being the least - he stated: “Throughout the period of lockdown we have been at level four. “Thanks to you, people across the country, we have collectively helped to bring the R level down. “We are now in a position to begin moving to level , in careful steps.” And he continued: “‘We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully mody the measures, gradually ease the restrictions and begin to allow people toto their usual way of le while avoiding a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.”  The Business Secretary said the UK would move to level three “when it is safe to do so”. The five tier aposCovid Alert Systemapos will be used to determine when it is safe for measures to be relaxed, and for le to gradually get back to normal. There are five tiers to the Covid Alert System. Level Five: Critical  - The virus is spreading rapidly and the NHS is overwhelmed. A tight lockdown is required.Level Four - Severe  - The NHS is stretched but coping. There is still community transmission of the disease . Level Three - Substantial-  The disease is in general circulation and the NHS is operating at extra capacity. Restrictions remain on the public sector and normal le.Level Two - Moderate  - There is low transmission of the disease, and the NHS is operating normally. Schools and businesses can open, with some special measures still in place.Level One - Low  - The disease is no longer present in the UK.

The artwork that once adorned the walls will have been torn down, their desks spaced two metres apart and toys, Lego blocks and even old fashioned counting beads will have disappeared. Lunchtimes will be spent at desks, outside play equipment cordoned off, toilet times will be scheduled and contact with teachers so limited that they won’t even be able to put a plaster on a child who falls over. This will be the sterile reality of le in the UK’s , primaries when they open in June. And teachers fear it will have a huge emotional impact on kids.  One East Yorkshire teacher said: “We are worried how this will affect children’s mental health and also educational outcomes. “I’m concerned that parents are not being made aware of what education will look like and that their child’s experience will be far from normal. “Children have already undergone a lot of disruption and, at a time when we wish we couldto our normal routines in order to reassure them, I fear this will only unsettle them further.” Health Secretary Gavin Williamson has left it to inidual schools to have “flexibility” to follow Government guidelines, which mirror the approach of schools in Denmark which started a phasedin April. Head teachers now face the headache of making their schools safe for reception and Year One and Six primary classes and in just two weeks. The guidelines suggest schools introduce one-way systems for kids, ide corridors to keep them apart and stagger breaks as well as arrival and home times so parents don’t congregate. It’s also advised youngsters are placed into small gangs of friends who will not be allowed to mix with other sets or dferent years. Constant hand-washing will be in place when kids arrive, come in from play and before and after eating. The guidelines state: “Consider how to encourage young children to learn and practice these habits through games, songs and repetition.” One head teacher this week took the unusual move of spelling out the changes to parents on her school website, writing: “Some of the parents who want their child tohave stated this is for their mental health and well-being. “This worries me more as I do feel some of the measures I will have to take will completely work against this.”  In a list of changes, headed ‘The Truths’, headteacher Marianne Allan, of Cambois Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, told parents that all unnecessary furniture and equipment will be removed, teachers will not be allowed to sit beside pupils who need help and lunches will be eaten in classrooms. Ms Allan said children who fall over or have a toilet accident will be encouraged to change themselves or clean their scrape or cut. Otherwise parents will have to collect them. In a poignant message she wrote: “Today I looked at a memory on my phone. It was from a year ago today when some girls in year  and  made me the most beautul table for my lunch, it was covered in lip gloss to smell nice and full of sparkle and jewels. “This is the school I miss. These are the activities we hope to resume. “This will NOT be possible in June. This is the school we want to see back, where children run up and hug their teachers and friends. The school children can walk safely around a building without measures or go to the toilet without supervision and for them to be cleaned afterwards.”  The Government has prioritised reception and Year one learners because they are learning “basic essentials” and Year Six so they can prepare for the move to High School. In Secondaries, Year  and  will get some “face-to-face” time with teachers. But one primary teacher in Bridlington said: “The classrooms will be striped bare of any joy. “Art work will be banned from the wall, resources like counting bricks and beads will be banned to stop the spread of the virus. “Our school has made the decision not to mark exercise books for  hours just to be safe. “it’s so sad because there will be no toys for the little ones in reception and we won’t even be able to help them take bottle lids off their juicethey struggle. “I don’t say this to make parents feel guilty because I know some have no choice but to send their children, but they have a right to know what the reality will be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"anne diamond disgruntled meghan make","story":"NewsopinionAnne Diamond: Disgruntled Meghan will make a mint from her diary on royal leMeghan Markle kept a personal diary all the time she lived in Britain documenting her engagement to Prince Harry, the wedding and beyond which will be published as a bombshell memoirShareCommentsByAnne Diamond:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionMeghan Markle and husband Harry are already releasing a book on royal le \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It’s been revealed that she kept a diary all the time she lived in Britain, covering everything from her engagement to Harry, the wedding and beyond. Well,any of us wondered how the Sussexes would finance their new le together “out of the limelight” in Los Angeles, we need wonder no more. A diary, even a tame one, would make a bombshell memoir and a prize beyond price for both Meghan and any publisher brave enough to bid for the rights. And we’d all be daft enough to buy it. We’re already pre-ordering the book we KNOW she’s been ­controlling. It’s called Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, and it’s due out in August. If the very title ­annoys you like it does me then you can only imagine what self-serving conceit lurks inside. How, only two years married, can they claim to understand the making of a modern Royal Family  Especially since they’ve turned their back on royalty  Meghan says she hopes it will “finally set the record straight and show the world why they were left with no other choice than to leave the royal le”. She also apparently believes “readers will finally understand the monumental anguish and turmoil she had to endure with a stf upper lip” and “see her ­vulnerable side, something the book does in great detail”.  We may be curious, even scornful, but she’ll be laughing all the way to the bank. As for the diary, we don’t knowshe’s even thinking of making it public – but what a nest egg, should she ever need it. I can’t help but wonderHarry knew his lovely bride was sitting down to chronicle her thoughts as the royals flailed around in their futile attempts to welcome her and make her happy. In my day, women were ­encouragedto build themselves a ‘F*** Off Fund’, should their relationships go bad.

It got scared by my presence and this was when you could tell it was a large cat, from the way it ran through the long grass. I have now been told that just up the road from this sighting, there was a lamb discovered with its head missing in a unclean manner. Wild cat sightings have been claimed across the British countryside, with numerous alleged sightings in rural Devon and Cornwall. Their existence in the wild here in the UK is still a much debated topic. Plenty of people believe we have enough evidence to suggest they do exist. Brett Bennett recently took photos of huge, four-clawed cat paw prints pretty close to where the black cat was supposedly seen, in Holbeam Wood in Newton Abbott. Brett said: These woods arenapost used very much at the moment due to lockdown, and itaposs only about a five-mile walk from here to Dartmoor, so when I saw the prints it made me think. I sent the photos to my partner, and she said that there had been sightings around this area before. Brett said heaposs recently been finding more animal remains, like deer legs, during walks with his dog, Kalba. Rumours of big cats on the moors of Devon and Cornwall have been around for a long time, often referred to as the Beast of Bodmin, Exmoor or Dartmoor. This theory, made public in July last year, mainly comes from Benjamin Mee, owner of Dartmoor Zoo, revealing three pumas were due to arrive their nearly  years ago, but instead were supposedly released into the wild by circus entertainer and former Plymouth Zoo owner, Mary Chipperfield. Mr Mee said Dartmoor Zoo was expecting a delivery of five pumas after Plymouth Zoo was forced to close down in . Rather than surrender them to another zoo, Ms Chipperfield is thought to have released her favourite breeding pair into the wild, plus a young male to keep them company. Thereaposs been loads of alleged sightings of the animals over the years in Devon and Cornwall. Initially it was rumoured to be prowling across Bodmin Moor, and was called the Beast of Bodmin. The mysterious creature is described as a phantom wild cat, possibly with two sharp prominent teeth like those found on a leopard. It was first spotted in  and ever since reports of the Beast of Bodmin have flooded in. Since , more than  sightings have been reported in the Devon and Cornwall force area. Information supplied following a Freedom of InformationAct request show that officers were called on  separate occasions between January  and July . On at least four occasions officers attended but took no further action to investigate.

The Mirror is building on this by connecting people for unique online conversations – it’s a chance to meet someone dferent, find out what others are going through and even help people feel less lonely. Before the coronavirus crisis, Joan Pons Laplana and Thomas Webb might never have met. Joan, originally from Barcelona, is a senior charge nurse at a busy ­intensive care unit in Sheffield. Thomas, Norfolk born and bred, is a supermarket checkout worker. Joan, , is an outgoing father-of-three who is passionate about the NHS and Spanish music.  Thomas, , is a self-described introvert who is into his girlfriend, video games and a drop of cider. But this pandemic has changed who matters in our country. Now, in May , Thomas and Joan are both key workers keeping Britain fed and alive – two of the heroes we all clap for on our ­doorsteps on Thursday nights. For our ground-breaking Britain Connects project, we asked Joan and Thomas to meet up via a videocall and chat about their experiences. The result was a fascinating conversation that touched on love, loneliness, le, death and everything in between. “As you can see from my accent it’s not a Yorkshire accent, I’m Spanish,” says Joan, introducing himself. “I’ve been here for  years, working in the NHS. I’m a nurse. I’m working tonight in intensive care.” Thomas, from Great Yarmouth, smiles. “I work in the local ­supermarket, I’ve lived here most of my le, I’ve got a typical Norfolk accent, I guess,” he says. “According to the Government we’ve gone from being low-skilled workers to key workers,” Joan says. Thomas modestly says his job just isn’t as important as Joan’s. They chat about protective equipment. Joan feels like Robocop in PPE – it takes him  minutes to put on. Thomas says he uses endless hand sanitiser, and that Asda has introduced measures such as screens and one-way systems to keep staff safe. Out and about though, he doesn’t use a mask because he wants there to be enough for people like Joan.Joan speaks eloquently about how he’s felt since Brexit.“In the past few years, people very quickly wanted to know where I came from,” he says. “That has disappeared, now people are not bothered where I come from, they’re just happy to see me and happy that I’m a nurse. “That feeling of belonging has come back because in the past few years, as a non-British national, I felt a bit ‘not wanted’ from the Government and part of society. “In a way, we’ve come back to when I came here years ago. It doesn’t matter where you come from. I hope that this feeling will carry on after.” Thomas looks serious. “It shouldn’t matter where you come from. You’re more than welcome. You call the UK your home.”Thomas has kept apart from his girlfriend Paris in lockdown – to protect her and her parents from the risks his job brings. But they work together at Asda, making it hard. Joan is amazed by Thomas’s resolve in not being tempted to see a loved one. “I would be,” admits Joan. “We’re human. My kids don’t live with me and I’m finding that very hard. “My -year-old... I haven’t seen him for over four weeks. “He’s just had his th birthday over Zoom. But as soon as he turns  you can’t see your kid, because they’re adults. One day I’m allowed to see him, the following day I’m not...” Thomas agrees. “It’s been lonely,” he says. “I work with my partner on a few of my shts and it’s very tempting just to go over there but I can’t because I’ve got to do my job. It’s lonely but she does her best to make sure I’m not by Facetiming as much as she can.” He is worried because his mental health hasn’t been great in the past. “I look at my front door and feel like I can’t open that, I’m locked in,” he says. “I go to work, interact a bit. You can see your work mates but you can’t see your mate mates.” Joan looks serious. “When I see colleagues getting poorly and maybe die, I think, ‘I may be next’, that’s at the back of my mind.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad schoolgirl genette tate who","story":"NewsDad of schoolgirl Genette Tate who vanished  years ago dies without learning her fateThe -year-old went missing on her paper round in Aylesbeare, Devon in August  but her remains have never been foundShareCommentsByAdam Aspinall:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsDevon schoolgirl Genette Tate went missing  years ago\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He has an ex-we and a young daughter – she left him, although he’s never been altogether clear about why she walked out on  the marriage.

Horus, Dadou, Thea and Cersei are believed to have been taken from their mothers before they were weaned as part of the exotic wildle trade. The Born Free Foundation said they were kept in “completely inadequate conditions” in France. The four, now known as the Lions of Lyon, were just a few months old when they were rescued by French wildle charity, Fondation  Million d’Amis. Dadou was found on Paris’s most famous street – the Champs-Elysees – in the back of a Lamborghini missing the tip of his tail after his owner was caught by police officers taking photos with the cub.  Horus, the largest of the four cubs, was found on a child’s bed in an apartment on the outskirts of Paris while his owner was hiding in his neighbour’s cupboard. Police were alerted after images of the cub had been posted on Snapchat. Cersei was found on the same day as Horus in a garage in Marseille and was suffering from a catalogue of illnesses. As well as being very underweight, she also had skin irritation, a dull coat, gastrointestinal problems and corneal ulcers. Thea, the smallest and youngest of the cubs, was surrendered by her owner. She had glaucoma, and was under-developed and underweight, with extreme hair loss and diarrhoea.

Cynical Boris Johnson fibbed in Parliament to hide his culpability for mass deaths in care homes. Three MPs, including Health Minister Nadine Dorries – once forced to confess her blog was “% fiction” – shared a far-Right-distorted video to smear Keir Star­­mer after he skilfully exposed Johnson’s fatal failings. The Labour leader was attacked for buying his disabled mam a field in  to look after donkeys she rescued – a generous act by a caring son any mother would adore. Teachers are bullied for demanding proper protection before going back to school after the lives of NHS and care home staff were sacriced by government incompetence. And London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Labour and a Muslim, is blamed for fare increases the Tories are imposing infor a £.billion rescue package, after the same Tories told passengers to stay off his buses, Tubes and trains.  Tories doing what Tories do – blaming others for their own mistakes – is why a PM who lied repeatedly to win the electionisn’t to be trusted about what comes next. The recession to end all recessions will, estimates the Office for Budget Responsibility, multiply the £bn deficit that existed before Covid- to £bn – double the peak under Gordon Brown after the  global financial crash.

Many say even the limited easing comes far too soon - with England still seeing thousands of new Covid- infections and hundreds of deaths per day. And Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all stopped short of easing the lockdown in the way Mr Johnson has.

But it will take more than  years for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to clear the sum. The cash was spent renovating Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage to the pair’s high standards after they married in . Meghan, , is understood to have chosen eco-friendly, toxin-free, vegan paint for the walls. Five apartments were knocked together to re-form the cottage, while beams, floors and the water and gas systems were replaced. But in the past six months the couple have spent just two weeks in what was meant to have become their family home. That is unlikely to change after they moved into a £.million, -bed Hollywood villa, loaned to them by actor Tyler Perry. And when they quit being full-time royals earlier this year, Harry vowed to repay the cash. Now it is believed the couple have agreed a “rental-plus” deal, above market rate, to keep Frogmore as their official UK base. The Queen has made it clear they can use it indefinitely. This year Buckingham Palace said they “will no longer receive public funds for royal duties”. But Graham Smith, from anti-monarchy group, Republic, said the couple are still more than rich enough to repay the money, “plus interest”, in one lump sum. He said: “Taxpayers need their money back, particularly now we’ve been hit by the huge costs of the coronavirus. “The couple, with their vast amount of millions in the bank, should explain why they aren’t paying it back immediately.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with everything you need in one placeThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

After many people spent the weekend sunbathing and having picnics outdoors, public transport operators are now preparing to carry extra commuters to offices, factories and building sites on Monday. The move comes at the start of the first full working week since Boris Johnson set out his plan for the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, urging those employees unable to work from home toto their places of employment as he sought to re-start economic activity. He has faced criticism from some unions and opposition MPs who accused him of moving too quickly while the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have refused to follow suit.

Researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group began testing the vaccine candidate ChAdOx nCoV- in humans on April  to see whether it can protect healthy people from Covid-. The programme will allow researchers to assess the safety of the candidate, and its ability to generate an immune response. - How does the study work  Up to , participants have been recruited across multiple study sites in Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol. The volunteers have been randomly allocated to receive either the ChAdOx nCoV- vaccine or a licensed meningitis vaccine that will be used as a control for comparison. A separate small group of  volunteers were set to get two doses of the candidate four weeks apart, the first administered at the start of the trial.- Who is participating Volunteers must be aged -, and cannot have tested positive for Covid-. They must also be in good health, not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and must not have previously taken part in a trial with an adenoviral vaccine or received any other coronavirus vaccines. - How will the trial work  The dose used in the trial was chosen based on previous experiences with other ChAdOx based vaccines. Participants will not know whether they have received the Covid- vaccine or the control vaccine until the end of the trial. On April , the first two participants were vaccinated, one with the ChAdOx nCoV- vaccine and one with the control vaccine. On day three, six more volunteers were vaccinated, half with the Covid- vaccine and three with the control vaccine. On the fth day, researchers began vaccinating larger numbers of participants. - What happened next  The participants were given an e-diary to record any symptoms they experience in the seven days after receiving the vaccine, andthey feel unwell for the following three weeks. During a series of follow-up visits, blood samples will be taken to assess their immune response, and their observations checked. If they develop Covid- symptoms during the study, they can contact a member of the clinical team, who will checkthey have become infected with the virus. If a participant becomes very unwell they will be reviewed by staff at the hospital. - When will the results be available  The statisticians will compare the number of infections in the control group with the number of infections in the vaccinated group.. Therefore, it is necessary for a small number of study participants to develop Covid-. How quickly researchers reach the numbers required depends on the levels of virus transmission in the community. If transmission remains high, enough data may be available in a couple of months buttransmission levels drop, this could take up to six months. - What is the vaccine  ChAdOx nCoV- is made from ChAdOx, which is a weakened version of a common cold virusthat causes infections in chimpanzees. It has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans. Researchers hope their version will make the body recognise and develop an immune response to the spike protein - recognisable in images of the virus - that will help stop Covid- from entering human cells and therefore prevent infection. Imperial College London is also progressing with its vaccine candidate and will look to move into clinical trials by mid-June, with larger scale trials in October.:Soccer-La Liga chief confirms clubs will resume group training from MondayFootball in Spain has edged closer to ing after a long pause due to the COVID- pandemic after La Liga president Javier Tebas confirmed clubs in the top two isions will begin training in groups of up to  players from Monday.Theto group training follows a government announcement on Saturday allowing sports teams toto activity regardless of the status of the lockdown in their own region.Previously, only teams from regions that were in phase one of the de-escalation of the national state of emergency would be able toto training in groups.

Although full respect to those who choose to, she added.Instead, Elise hasnapost shaved for the last couple of months simply because it hasnapost made the top of [her] to-do list, she said, writing about her experience for Somerset Live.She explained the task is in the back of her mind as something she will eventually do when she has a spare spot. But Iaposve been busy, she said, really busy. While many people have expressed how bored theyaposve been during lockdown Elise has said sheaposs working harder than ever and is certainly not sitting around with nothing to do. She explained: There’s lots of stories about how to fill time during lockdown boredom – but there’s plenty of us out there who are working harder than ever. I don’t just mean the healthcare heroes on the frontline, who have rightly been the focus of any mention of work still going on. There’s plenty of us who are working less noble – but still very demanding jobs. Elise went on to explain that, at her new site, a number of employees have been furloughed but sheaposs still working and thereaposs a lot to be done. I’ve also been working hard to prepare for my senior journalism qualications, spending hours of my own time on that each day, she added. Concerned about the usual exercise she gets running for trains and in her regular netball training sessions, Elise added that sheaposs also followed a workout routine during lockdown. She said: So I’ve come up with a full-on daily exercise checklist– looking to take long walks, - minute hard cardio workout videos and - minute dance videos each day. Most days I do it, but it takes way longer than my non-lockdown routine would take. Elise went on to point out that she doesnapost necessarily think sheaposs shedding any pounds but that sheaposs doing the exercise more because it makes her feel better. It gives me structure and purpose and clears my head, she said. So why specically has Elise struggled to find the time for a quick shave  Because she doesnapost actually shave. Sheaposs never done it in her le. She explained: My headline isn’t entirely accurate. I’ve never actually shaved . You will have to forgive me because ‘de-hairing’ as I would accurately call it would have confused you. Usually Elise uses a combination of hot wax strips and hair removal cream so she can avoid having to shave every day and that horrible prickly feeling you get in between shaves. The only downside to her method is that it takes her around and hour to do it properly. So itaposs much more of a commitment than a quick shave in the shower. Elise continued, saying that usually events in her le will spur her on to de-hair as she puts it. That could be anything from a party or an important, face-to-face work meeting. Of course, there’s none of that at the moment during lockdown, she pointed out. Honestly it’s not just de-hairing – it’s all vanity really. Elise admitted she has felt a bit self-conscious about it all at times. She said: When I’ve been out for my walks in a sleeveless top or dress and it’s crossed my mind – I have tried to consciously keep my arms down to hide my hair .

The Good Omens and American Gods writer made the journey to his home on the Isle of Skye in breach of Scotlandaposs lockdown rules, the Daily Record reports. Writing on his blog, the writer said he travelled after he and we agreed they needed to give each other some space. He is married to singer Amanda Palmer. He described how he flew masked and gloved from Auckland Airport to Los Angelesand then on to London before borrowing a friendaposs car and driving north to Skye. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Only essential journeys are permitted under lockdown rules in Scotland, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressing the message north of the border is aposstay at homeapos. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is also the MP for Skye, said: Can I just remind anyone  thinking of coming to the Highlands this is against the regulations. To come from the other end of the planet is gobsmacking. We will welcome all to the Highlands when it is safe to do so. For now stay away.  In a post on his blog on Thursday, science fiction and fantasy author Gaiman wrote: Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockdown on my own. He said he was in New Zealand with his we and son Ash until two weeks ago, when the country went from level four of lockdown - which it had been on for the previous five weeks - to level three. Gaiman wrote: I flew, masked and gloved, from empty Auckland Airport to LAX, an empty international terminal with only one check-in counter open - the one for the BA flight from LAX to London. Both flights were surreal, especially the flight to London. Empty airports, mostly empty planes. It reminded me of flying a week after  : everythingaposs changed.  I landed in London about  in the morning, got a masked car service to a friendaposs house. He had a spare car , with some groceries for me in a box in the back, waiting in the drive, with the key in the lock. He added: I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and Iaposve been here ever since. He said his family are looking forward to being together again once the world opens up and travel gets easier, and that Amanda and I are still very much together, even with half a world between us. But Gaiman has been criticised on social media for making the journey.

The original photos were taken last month during Holy Week and show Father Pelc, of St Ambrose Parish, standing in his robes and a face mask, spraying people through their car windows.

The priest, who has served his parish for over  years, told TODAY heaposs got a pretty wacky mind and pretty accepting congregation - admitting they squealed in delight. The original idea was to do something for the kids of the parish, he told BuzzFeed News.They were about ready to have an Easter unlike any of their past, so I thought, what can we still do that would observe all the protocols of social distancing  Father Pelc first consulted about the safety of the idea with a doctor friend who then provided him with PPE and even joined the priest with his own kids. Referring to the imagesapos popularity online, Father Pelc said: I’m not objecting to it, this whole idea of combating evil is a good one. We all want to believe that the devil is not the most powerful force on the earth and neither is COVID-. Father Pelc went on to tell TODAY while his water pistol ploy was light hearted, the people of Detroit are taking lockdown very seriously.  He said his parish could be re-opened next Sunday for public masses but the feeling he has from people is itaposs too early. People are saying they don’t want to come out just yet. There’s still a lot of fear out there and I don’t blame them. In the meantime, the parish has been making use of livestreams and pre-recorded services, with up to three masses worth tuning in.

The Russian girl’s story was earlier seen around the world after her claim highlighted in a nationwide TV show the pregnancy was from consensual sex with a boy, . Now in a new posting to her , social media followers, Darya, now , said: Here is my long awaited post about the biological dad…. “It is a painful issue for me. “I could not move away for a long time and the pain still remains in my soul.” To a question ‘Who is the father ’, she posted: “It was a rape. “I cannot tell how it happened, because it is painful to recall. “For the long time after that accident, I could not do anything, it was scary and lonely at the same time.” She previously strongly denied as “complete nonsense” a report in Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that she had been raped on an apartment block staircase by a teen boy. She continued for four months to insist the father was her friend Ivan , , with whom she says she is now in a relationship. Darya now says the report was inaccurate and that her attacker was at least  and not from her school. She said: “This man was very fat for his age. And very tall. “The most scary is that he lives in the same town, and our town is small.” Zheleznogorsk, where Darya is from, is closed to outsiders and is a key location for Russia’s nuclear industry. “I am really scared to meet him somewhere on the street,” she said. “It was in November and really on the staircase. “It was dark already and that is why no one could help. “I cannot say more, think you understand me.” But she added that she knows the name of the “rapist” and the case is being handled by a state investigator from Moscow. I told the Moscow investigator everything that happened,” she said. “This man is so far free, as after I give birth they will do a DNA test andit confirms that man, they will decide what action to take.” She said that she had been unable to tell her mother the truth for a long time. “The most offensive was that I could not tell anyone,” she said. Earlier she and the -year-old boy had stuck to their original story of how she became pregnant, despite doctors saying it was impossible. Last month they revealed the baby would be a girl who they planned to call Karolina and raise together. In January, Darya told TV viewers: It was Vanyaaposs idea [to have sex]. “But I did not mind. “He closed the door leaving the key in the lock, so his mum could not open the door. “It was scary a bit, that it would be painful. “It was just a little - and then everything was normal. “It was a bit shameful, we were just hiding under the blanket. “I did not think that aged  he can do such things... I thought that nothing would happen.” Dr Evgeny Grekov, a urology and andrology expert, who examined Ivan told TV viewers in a show called ‘Father at ! ’ : “We rechecked the laboratory results three times so there cannot be any mistake.” The medic said on camera: “There cannot be sperm cells. “He is still a child.” Ivan’s mother Galina backed this version. “I believe my son that he is the father,” she said. “I understand that he himself maybe doesnapost realise what happened.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"coronavirus live the key updates on may 16","story":"Keep up with the latest updates as the coronavirus pandemic continues throughout Scotland and the UK.Reporters from across the DCT Media titles will keep you up to date with the latest closures, cancellations, health information and more.We’ll bring you all of the news as it happens throughout the day:The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/727898-1-505x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc foreign legion scottish steel barry smith","story":"Dundee legend Barry Smith has lted the lid on how he adapted to the Bonettis’ “off-the-cuff” approach to le at Dens Park.It’s  years since the managerial duo of enigmatic brothers, Ivano and Dario, arrived to take charge at the Dark Blues.Having played under some of the biggest names at the biggest Italian clubs, challenging for league titles and European trophies, the pair arrived with a burgeoning contacts book and plenty of ambition.An influx of foreign players followed, with Claudio Caniggia, Juan Sara, Fabian Caballero, Marco de Marchi and Georgi Nemsadze arriving in the first year.The second saw the likes of Temuri Ketsbaia, Julian Speroni and Fan Zhiyi come in.The excess that funded all of these big names eventually caught up with the club as they failed to sell them on and administration beckoned a year after the Bonettis departed.Prior to their appointment, the Dark Blues had enjoyed a positive campaign under Jocky Scott.But huge changes lay ahead and former club captain and manager Smith knew he had two options – leave or get with the programme.He said: “There was probably a mix of anticipation and trepidation among the players, we really just didn’t know what to expect.“We had a good squad when they came in, we had finished a point off fth under Jocky Scott but the first day back in pre-season there were a few new faces around.“I always said thatyou think your face doesn’t fit then it’s up to you to make it fit. My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53741458-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee fc john nelms spfl","story":"The result of Tuesday’s failed SPFL inquiry vote has vindicated Dundee managing director John Nelms, according to a Dark Blues fan chief.Following weeks of back-biting and sniping over the Dens Park supremo’s now infamous voting U-turn at the start of April, two thirds of league clubs voted against an independent inquiry.With nine out of  Championship clubs voting ‘no’, chairman of the Dundee Supporters# Association, Kenny Ross, believes a “clear statement” has been made in relation to Nelms# actions.And Ross also insists the response from Dundee fans at large has been one of acceptance.He told the Tele: “The club seem quite relaxed about what’s been going on the past couple of weeks, not saying anything.“John Nelms doesn’t say much at the best of times but I think that relaxed attitude is echoed by the fans.“With nine out of  Championship clubs voting no, there is also a clear statement there and I think it vindicates John Nelms.“Personally, I would have liked an inquiry because there are questions that need answered but it was pretty overwhelming from Dundee’s fellow Championship clubs and % of all the clubs that it wasn’t wanted.“It’s clear from that there isn’t really a problem from most clubs on the U-turn – the majority wanted it with over % voting that way and the Deloitte inquiry said there was no wrongdoing.“With reconstruction talks ending, fans do wonder what John Nelms achieved through the U-turn but I think we are all past it now. I’ve not had anyone on to me about it all, there’s very little online about this week’s vote – I don’t think anyone really cares now.”Rangers vehemently led the call for a vote on an independent inquiry into the SPFL’s conduct during the coronavirus shutdown, as well as Dundee’s actions in changing their vote.That led to Gers fans bombarding online posts from the club and DSA social media, but Ross believes the reaction from fellow Dundee supporters is telling.He added: “Anytime the DSA are posting stuff on social media, we have to go through and delete loads of stuff.“It’s almost amusing now – Dundee fans responding generally laugh at them. Dundee have been getting hammered but they are not rising to it all and that, I think, shows the general feeling of the support.“It is bizarre because Dundee’s vote hasn’t affected Rangers really – our club has been affected more because there’s now no play-offs.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/ginkin/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2020/05/pink-grapefruit-tonic-cheesecake-612x360.jpg ","title":"revealed dario bonetti kicked rugby park","story":"The Bonetti era at Dundee didn’t throw up many dull moments – and Kilmarnock fans will certainly remember the night assistant Dario entertained them in the stands at Rugby Park.A combination of a car accident, a paperwork error and Bonetti missing a Killie goal saw Ayrshire fans that night experience both sides of the charismatic and, at times, volatile Italian.With no place on the bench for Dark Blues assistant manager, Dario watched the game from the press box behind the home supporters in the main stand.The Evening ’s former senior football writer, Tom Duthie, had a front-row seat to the spectacle.He said: “Most of the squad had travelled the night before the game, but Dario Bonetti was heading west on the Saturday.“Unfortunately an accident blocked the main road between Glasgow and Kilmarnock and along with most fans, and press, Dario did not arrive at Rugby Park in time for kick off.“When he got there he found his name had not been included on the official list of those in the Dundee technical area and, for once, the assistant manager had to head for the stand to observe the action.“Along with full-back Marcello Marrocco, who was injured, he decided to join us in the press box at the back of the main stand.“Given that the stand is for home fans, it crossed my mind this could lead to problems because I knew there was no way the passionate Italian would stay quiet. He didn#t.“But as well as kicking every ball for his team, big Dario also engaged with the punters sitting nearby and gave them what must have been one of their most entertaining match experiences ever.“Unfortunately for Dario his late arrival meant he missed an opening goal for Killie and although Dundee equalised before the break he was still unaware of it as he headed for the dressing-room at half-time.“There were some confused players in there as he blasted them and told them they were lucky to be ahead.“When he repeated that opinion on retaking his seat for the second-half I can remember a couple of awkward minutes as Marrocco, Dundee#s press officer Niall Scott and I discussed who should be the one to tell him the correct score.“I escaped that dangerous task by pointing out I was not a club employee and they were.“If memory serves me, it was Marrocco who broke the news, to be met with an eruption from his assistant gaffer.“I should add that outside of game time, Dario was as charming as his brother.“In their first season together the pair steered Dundee to a top six finish and produced a team capable of playing football that was as pleasing on the eye as anything theof the country.“As their second season progressed, however, Ivano was making increasingly frequent trips back to Italy and it was clear all was not well behind the scenes.“It came as no surprise when he was replaced by Jim Duffy in the summer of  and in just over another year the extent of the club#s spending during the Bonetti experiment became clear as it plunged into administration and was on the brink of extinction.“For all that, Dundee fans understandably remember those two years with great fondness, as do press men like myself who experienced a time the like of which is highly unlikely to be seen again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

I think I’d prefer to do that.’McNaughton went on to explain, although Stavrum#s workrate wasn#t the highest, he was the type of talent who would #do nothing for  minutes and score two goals#.Injury and a less warm relationship with Paterson during Pele#s year-and-a-half at Pittodrie saw #Super Kev# making fewer Aberdeen starts, before his final two seasons under Calderwood, where he was once again a mainstay of the team.McNaughton revealed he thinks Calderwood#s tendency to chop and change his team and the lack of a domestic cup run were his downfall, despite top-six finishes and # after McNaughton#s departure # a fantastic run in the UEFA Cup which included meetings with Atletico Madrid, Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen and Bayern Munich.In the episode of Northern Goal, which is available on your favourite podcast app, McNaughton also reveals the real story of his Dons departure, his reflections on owner Vincent Tan, FA Cup and League Cup losses in his time at Cardf City, as well as counting the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Fowler as team-mates.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of other things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.This week we discuss the effect of the Corona virus  on the tours, Steevie#s discovery of old golf clubs which he hopes might make him his fortune, Rangefinders and other golf tech and we take a quick visit to the old course in St. AndrewsAn entertaining listen which you can download for freePlay or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rallyers in inverness action","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe opening round of the  KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championships took place in and around Inverness last weekend with a good entry of  cars.The event, on Saturday March , was three weeks later than usual to try and avoid the worst of the weather. There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings. They had a good day and brought the car home in th overall and eighth in a competitive Class . They plan to do the full season, so watch this space for updates on their progress.The closely contested event was finally won by Michael Binnie and Clare Mole in a Mitsubishi Evo, with the ever present Jock Armstrong and Cameron Fair taking second place in the TEG Sport Impreza, after leading the rally for much of the day. Freddie Milne and Patrick Walsh in the Fiesta R were third overall.Next up is the Speyside Rally in Elgin on April ."},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre has its finger on the pulse","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Soccer Centre volunteers have received vital first aid training.Sports clubs are required to ensure a number of their volunteers have a valid first aid certicate and when Lochgilphead Soccer Centre looked to secure the services of an accredited firm to provide the required two-day course, outdoor and first aid coach Andy Craven was happy to help.Covering theory and practice of all fundamental aspects of first aid, the volunteers were grateful to Andy for his informative and interactive approach to learning important skills and knowledge to safeguard the welfare of players and spectators.Soccer Centre chairman Stuart Green  said: #It is not just about having the relevant certicate, but ensuring a good number of our volunteers have the knowledge, skills and equipment to look after our youngsters and their friends and families.#Knocks and sprains are common in football and we deal with them every week, however, even as volunteers, we have an obligation to be prepared with any eventuality and Andy was first class in guiding our volunteers through a range of scenarios.#Andy said: #Whilst first aid is a serious business, the folks at Lochgilphed Soccer Centre were a great bunch. They were keen to learn and kept me on my toes with a range of questions.#I am a qualied outdoor and first aid instructor and have been working with community and sports groups throughout Argyll and Bute and their enthusiasm and desire to develop skills to look after members of their community in the event of something going wrong never ceases to impress me.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

Harbour seal pups shed their whitecoat in the womb before being born and so can be in the water and swim almost straight from birth. Females need to give birth on land though.ldquoGrey seal pups are born with the white lunugo fur and have to stay on land much more until they moult this off around three weeks after giving birth.He saidanyone spots a seal entangled in material such as fishing gear, they should contact British Divers Marine Le Rescuebdmlr.org.uk index.php, which has trained people in East Lothian who will try to capture and free the seal.Mr Malone, who studied zoology at University of Glasgow, has been through this training and has had to aid hundreds of seals all over the world.He was delighted to capture on camera a large group of around  seals, some pregnant, near the Musselburgh lagoons while out for his daily exercise on a cycle from his Edinburgh home.They were hauled out on exposed rocks, just offshore and past the lagoons, heading towards Prestonpans.Mr Malone said: ldquoHarbour seal numbers have actually been in quite drastic decline around Scotland, especially on the east coast, so it was good to see this big group of them.ldquoI am a bit of a fan of seals, having worked on numerous projects on them. This included a project at University of St Andrews where we were looking at the diet of both harbour and grey seals all around Scotland.He now runs his own environmental education organisation, Wildside Nature, which offers workshops and projects to all stages of learners, designed to bring real le science and nature experiences to students.He said: ldquoI use my background as a zoologist to deliver fun, active and engaging workshops on a wide iety of wildle subjects.ldquoI have run workshops in schools and nurseries all over East Lothian including both the Burgh and Loretto RC Primary Schools in Musselburgh and Law Primary School at North Berwick.ldquoI also run sessions at many other schools, nurseries and even with elderly groups all around Scotland and the north of England.Mr Malone is continuing to support childrenrsquos distance learning during the Covid- lockdown.He said: ldquoI have been making activities that people can do at home to help them connect with nature during the current period.ldquoThis has included making bird food from kitchen waste and putting out material that birds will use for nesting material.

being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to

reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

This could have added benefits such as a drop in carbon emissions as people will spend less time on the roads.Here the government has a role by making sure connectivity is improved. Kumar is hopeful this will happen with the advent of G and believes those areas where connection is poor should be prioritised.Online business is also expected to become more relevant. Digital payments and online commerce have already increased.ldquoMore of us are ordering online and that trend will continue, he said.ldquoBusinesses will have to improve their digital footprint to manage these changes in citizen and consumer behaviour.It is not only the private sector that will have to change but also the public sector as people will expect better communication, for example.Many local authorities still use snail mail to communicate with residents even though simple messages could be sent more cheaply, quickly and safely by SMS or email.ldquoElectronic communications are better in situations like this and local authorities will have to think about how they engage with citizens as opposed to the traditional ways for simple communications, said Kumar. ldquoItrsquos about being smarter in terms of dferentiating the services for dferent citizens.Good information sharing between dferent organisations has also shown to be lacking by the crisis.ldquoWhat we need across both the private and public sector is an infrastructure that allows us to share information securely and quickly, Kumar said. ldquoIt is really necessary for the infrastructure to be improved. We can see this especially in the social care sector - how do we get real time information out on what is happening in care homes, especially for families who have loved ones there and also for the health care agencies so they can provide a better service Another problem caused by the virus is the effect on the economy and Kumar warned there would be a lot of pressure on both the private and public sector to become more cost effective.ldquoFor some time there might be pressure on doing more with less and how we do that ndash itrsquos easier to use automation and so you can focus on more complex things where you need people to get involved, he said.ldquoThe key thing for organisations is to work with their employees and think about their development. They need to make sure their journey is managed with the right skills and training to help them move in their jobs.For example, said Kumar, many organisations have been giving low quality customer experience because their employees are bogged down by mundane tasks rather than focused on customer experience.ldquoAutomation can help that,he said. ldquoOrganisations should be enabling employees who have great insight and experienceand moving them into highvalue jobs.How technology can protect employees and the economyTALK ofrobots may have many people thinking of Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator but the reality is far from terrying and more about how they can improve our lives, according to Kirsty Ramsay, vice-president of CGI UKrsquos Consulting Delivery Centre.She believes the coronavirus pandemic is making society and business stop and think about where we could have been had automation been thoroughly embraced sooner.While public and private sector businesses, have established an element of automation, Ramsay thinks this will speed up in order to make sure employers, employees and students are safe, organise themselves quickly and are able to work and study remotely -there is a second wave of the virus or something similar.As someone with a background in the public sector, she is acutely aware of how efficiency could be improved with more automation and digitalisation. This will be crucial as so much of organisationsrsquo budgets are, quite rightly, being used to support critical services, support clients and employees and introduce new services that mitigate the effects of the virus lockdown.However automation, she says, is not about job losses but about making sure that employees are focussed on the most valuable tasks, so they are not swamped with mundane jobs but can concentrate on what is really important.ldquoWe are not saying that huge swathes of people will disappear and be replaced by robots, she said.ldquoThat is not what is going to happen but some organisations may not, for example, be able to carry the same amount of vacant roles and will start to consider how employees can focus on critical tasks and process exceptions.An example of how automation can help can be seen in a robot that speeds up the process of referral of a patient to a consultant by a GP.ldquoThe number of steps this one task goes through is signicant but actually the doctor is raising a request for a patient to see a consultant, the appointment is put in his diary and a letter is sent out to the patient, said Ramsay.ldquoWe have built a robot that can carry out this repeatable task. Introducing this into the mainstream processing means time is freed up and can be used to deal with exceptions or more value added tasks.ldquoMany organisations have staff with a lot of experience and we should be thinking about how we can reduce repeatable tasks and give them time back to deal with process exceptions or value added work. It is about how we can help organisations get more from the investment made in their people."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-people-can-begin-enjoy-great-outdoors-doorstep","story":"IT might not be a thought everyone would relish, but one lockdown concession for Scots is that they can exercise freely outdoors more than once a day providing they remain with people from the same household or alone.But while most people concede taking regular exercise can bring a range of health benefits, they might need a little inspiration to get moving.To help, Ramblers Scotland has developed Medal Routes which lists more than  walks in Scotland, ranging infrom  minutes to an hour, which are available for every local authority area.

This week saw the first virtual FMQs, with Liam McArthur being beamed into the chamber from Orkney. A landmark moment, but again, weeks after Westminster had done the same. Itrsquos a dark day for devolution when the House of Lords has better embraced technology.Reluctance to a virtual Parliament comes from the belief that it offers a poorer quality of debate and scrutiny than ldquothe real thing. Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees Mogg declared this week that the off-the-cuff remarks, the flow of interventions and the ldquobobbing of members waiting to be heard was much missed. Asthe theatre of politics was what makes good laws and holds the powerful to account.The New Zealand Parliament has long had a % rule in place, where the whips of one party can cast % of their partyrsquos vote as long as % of its members are present. That allows parties to not just manage caring responsibilities but it lets members focus on constituency work.Imagine a situation where a big employer goes bust or a landslide takes out an arterial route. Shouldnrsquot we facilitate a system that allows MSPs to stay in their community and dial in for  mins to ask the First Minister a fully informed question rooted in what theyrsquove seen first hand A virtual parliament may have been borne from crisis, but it could be so much more than a sticking plaster. A permanent hybrid system that allows members to be present physically or digitally as their circumstances allow, could do wonders for both equality and the quality of our politics. MSPs could spend more time in their constituencies at key moments when a campaign or issue demands their attention is not in Edinburgh. It also might just make elected office more attractive to under-represented groups, particularly those with caring responsibilitiesThe criticism of this system is that it puts too much power in the hands of the whips. But that ignores the untrammelled power they have already, often exercised on a whim and informed by baggage and trades.Keeping MSPs two metres apart at the moment brings the capacity of the chamber down to  MSPs. If that sees just % of MSPs in the chamber at present, aspiring to % in the ldquonew normal would be a serious improvement.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-normal-people-dog-owners-football-helicopter-head","story":"Billy Connolly had an observation about the Wee Frees wanting to ban sex while standing because it might lead to dancing.

Humans need art and culture to make sense of pain and suffering.Coronavirus will inevitably prompt a wave of great art ndash movies, novels, music and theatre ndash which will interpret and explain what it was like to be a human when the world closed down and sickness was everywhere.In fact, wersquore already seeing culture respond to the virus. One of the artistic highlights of the last few weeks has been a series of short TV dramas called Isolation Stories ndash subtle, sad, funny takes on le during the pandemic.OriginsWe see humanity struggling to deal with catastrophe and crisis in our earliest cultural offerings: our origin stories.Whatrsquos the story of Noah but a Bronze Age disaster movie  Nearly all cultures have a flood myth. The Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh recounts a flood legend, as do Norse, Celtic, Native American and Aboriginal Australian myths.The flood is a universal story of destruction and survival. Itrsquos thought most flood myths have some root in reality. Perhaps a memory of the Ice Age. The biblical flood was possibly inspired by the ldquoMinoan Eruption of BC when a volcano devastated what is now the island of Santorini. It was one of the largest volcanic eruptions in human history, triggering tsunamis which would have caused death on an unimaginable scale. The Minoan Eruption might also be the basis for the Atlantis myth.Some of our greatest ancient literature is about mass death and ruination ndash from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Viking Ragnaroumlk, to Homerrsquos Iliad and Virgilrsquos Aeneid, both recounting the fall of Troy.Living with the permanence of disaster and devastation laid the ground for a cultural obsession with death which shaped our global religions. End Times lies at the heart of Christianity ndash the final book of the Bible, Revelation, is also known as The Apocalypse, after all.The dance of deathNothing left such a lasting scar on human culture, though, as the pandemics of the second millennium: the Black Death of the s, the plagues of the mid-s, the cholera outbreaks of the Victorian age. For hundreds of years, until the coming of modern medicine, death by infection was commonplace. Disease, fear and grief fed into culture in extraordinary ways.One of the greatest works of literature is The Decameron by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio ndash an immediate and lasting response to the Black Death, which ravaged Europe, killing half the population between -. The Decameron tells of a group of aristocrats who retire to a country house to wait out the plague. While in self-imposed quarantine they tell stories to pass the time. If therersquos one moral to the tales itrsquos this: Death doesnrsquot care who you are, itrsquos just a matter of luck and timing when the Grim Reaper comes knocking.Without The Decameron it is unlikely we would have Geoffrey Chaucerrsquos The Canterbury Tales ndash the foundation text of English literature published around . One of its most famous stories is The Pardonerrsquos Tale, directly influenced by the Black Death. In the story, a group of men set out to kill Death ndash who, wersquore told, took their friend and a thousand others ndash but instead, they end up killing each other. Nobody beats death.But it was through painting that the pain and suffering of the middle ages found the most powerful expression. Memento Mori paintingswere everywhere the skull appearing in artwork after artwork, often alongside the hourglass showing the sands of time trickling away.One look at The Triumph Of Death by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, painted around , and you will immediately understand how omnipresent mortality and disaster were for our medieval ancestors.It is a carnival of death on canvas. The painting is of a wasteland ndash Bruegel almost invents the idea of the post-apocalyptic. Everywhere skeletons are killing, capturing, torturing and humiliating men and women, from kings to beggars. Itrsquos truly nightmarish ndash and remains terrying.The painting foreshadows the horrors of the th century. One could easily imagine SS guards as the murderous skeletons. In fact, nowhere is Bruegel more echoed than in the  artwork Hell by the Chapman Brothers, featuring miniature models of Nazis engaged in appalling violence.Paintings of the Dance Of Death, or Danse Macabre, became ubiquitous from the s as Europe rebuilt after plague. In Danse Macabre art, Death leads people of all social classes to their graves. Le is fleeting, the allegory says, and what you have on Earth ndash wealth, power, beauty ndash is meaningless.The Danse Macabre persisted as a cultural mot well into the modern period. Most people will associate it today with the music of Camille Saint-Saeumlns, and the theme tune to the TV show Jonathan Creek. With its scratchy, spooky violins and spidery, disorientating cadences, part of the Danse Macabre is even known as ldquodiabolus in musica ndash the Devil in music.Pain on the pageWhen the novel began making a mark on culture in the s, Daniel Defoe ndash a master opportunist ndash was quick to jump onboard and use the memories of his own brush with End Times as a child to artistic advantage.Defoe lived through the  plague which ravaged London. Three years after his success with Robinson Crusoe, Defoe wrote A Journal Of The Plague Year. Itrsquos a fictional account of one man surviving amid the ruins of London, but historians, critics and scientists tend to agree that Defoe was pretty accurate in his rendering of real events.Reading the Journal today is like seeing a mirror held up to coronavirus. The same fears, scandals, emotions and acts of kindness affected people then, as they affect us now. The rich thrive, the poor die therersquos isolation, quarantine and social distancing nurses do the heavy lting therersquos panic buying conspiracy theories science and government struggle to cope. Whatrsquos changed Early Romantic writers grappled with death on a daily basis ndash death in childbirth, infant mortality, outbreaks of cholera and typhoid. To many people,you say ldquoRomanticism theyrsquoll think of John Keats expiring of TB aged just  in . Romanticism and death go hand in hand.Edgar Allan Poe was the dark dandy of the Romantic movement. His story The Masque Of The Red Death both harks back to medieval horrors, and looks forward to the lurid post-apocalyptic sensibilities of the th century. Itrsquos a perfect bridge in the art of the apocalypse.The story tells of a prince who hides out in his castle and parties while the plague rages outside. Itrsquos a clear lt from Boccaccio. At midnight, Death arrives in a blood-splattered robe. The masque ends with a castle full of corpses. Death, here, is like a slasher from a modern horror movie.The Romantics also saw the apocalyptic possibilities of science. Electricity was cutting edge in the late s. It was the erarsquos equivalent to articial intelligence and robots . The cause ceacutelegravebre of the time was experiments with electricity on dead frogs which made their legs kick. Such tinkering with nature had a profound impact on the young Mary Shelley.Her novel, Frankenstein, is the response of a terried society to the suffering science could unleash on humanityunrestrained. The book also marks a turning point in apocalyptic art as plague takes a back seat to manmade threats. Both Frankenstein and The Masque Of The Red Death would become central parts of the horror movie canon in the th century ndash an art-form influenced by two world wars, the Holocaust, and the looming threat of global destruction posed by the Cold War.Nuclear nightmaresThe new science that frightened Mary Shelley was a terrying fact of le come the Victorian era. HG Wells was waiting in the wings to become the purveyor extraordinaire of tales of mechanised apocalypse. His The War Of The Worlds tells of Earthrsquos near destruction at the hands of alien invaders. No longer did disease dominate our fears of destruction, but technology.The mechanised mass death of the First World War saw fears of the apocalypse seep into the deepest recesses of culture ndash most notably in the outpouring of war poetry by soldiers like Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. However, modernism itself was shaped by the trenches. The epitome of modernist poetry, TS Eliotrsquos The Waste Land, is a fractured meditation on death and decline. It ripples with apocalyptic imagery and sentiment, such as the line: ldquoI will show you fear in a handful of dust.German art in the aftermath of the First World War was soaked in death and destruction. Painters like Max Beckmann and Otto Dix, veterans of the trenches, depicted a world of skulls and cruelty, crippled soldiers and deformity. European towns were at this time full of mutilated men, some with their faces hidden behind masks so bad were their wounds. German expressionist cinema became a laboratory for dealing with fear and suffering in films like Nosferatu and The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari.From the , films, TV and books were all exploring themes of the apocalypse, often in the same way ndash via science fiction. Memories of genocide, wartime super-weapons like the V rocket, and the arrival of the Cold War with its threat of total destruction loomed large in our cultural consciousness.Cold War fears played out in three ways: via the metaphor of alien invasion in movies like The Day The Earth Stood Still and Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers. In monster movies like Them! and Godzillashowing the dangers of nuclear radiation. Through gritty realism in films like Threads or Nevil Shutersquos novel On The Beach, about a group of Australians waiting for atomic fallout to hit Melbourne.Fear humansSomething started to change in the late s, though. In apocalyptic art, the threat of global destruction now started coming from us, ordinary people, not just impersonal war or disease. As we entered the mass media age and live footage of murder, assassination and terror entered every home with a TV, culture picked up on the fact that other people were just as scary as bombs and germs. What greater symbol of humanityrsquos gt for self-destruction than the ruined Statue of Liberty lying half consumed by sand at the end of Planet Of The Apes  Mad Max took this ldquofear humans trope to its commercial peak.The zombie film came into being in  with George A Romerorsquos Night Of The Living Dead ndash since then wersquove been deluged with a genre which is about two things: the end of the world and how itrsquos other people we need to fear. Ironically, the zombie genre has eaten itself alive with an endless parade of films and TV shows from The Walking Dead to World War Z, and Train To Busan to Stake Land. Its ubiquity has drained its power. A better exploration of the danger posed by other people is found in the  British TV series Survivors.Literature is now in hock to the post-apocalyptic too. Young adult fiction is dominated by death and disaster with franchises like The Maze Runner and The Hunger Games. Our greatest writers seem compelled to meditate on the end of the world in works like Cormac McCarthyrsquos The Road and Jose Saramagorsquos Blindness.Before the rise of the superhero movie genre , blockbusters over the last few decades were dominated by the end of the world. Think of Armageddon, Deep Impact, The Day After Tomorrow, the Terminator series ndash with their very modern fears of asteroids, climate change, AI and robotics.Even comedy now embraces the apocalyptic with Shaun Of The Dead, This Is The End, and the TV series Last Man On Earth. Documentaries look increasingly at our penchant for self-destruction in programmes such as An Inconvenient Truth or Le After People. Computer games explore apocalypse and pandemic in titles like The Last Of Us.You may not think it, but modern music ndash from punk to pop ndash is also filled with End Times imagery. REMrsquos Itrsquos The End Of The World As We Know It Nenarsquos Cold War anthem  Red Balloons Einstein A Go-Go by Landscape OMDrsquos Enola Gay about the flight crew which dropped the A-bomb on Japan Eighth Day, Hazel OrsquoConnorrsquos rf on the rise of the robots New Orleans Is Sinking by The Tragically Hip, foretelling Hurricane Katrina. The list goes on. Even the most popular, ephemeral and upbeat form of culture is dominated by death and destruction.What it all proves is that wersquove been dreaming this dream of mass crisis and global panic for a very long time. Now we just happen to be living it. But as everyone from Boccaccio to Otto Dix shows us, we can get through it, we will survive. And once we do get through it, therersquoll be a rebirth, a genuine renaissance of art and literature, to explain these strange and sinister times wersquore experiencing."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-first-steps-get-started-injury-free-running-programme","story":"Sue Gyford of JogScotland says the organisation is delighted that so many people are taking advantage of the opportunity to do daily exercise, but stresses the importance of starting gradually.She said: \"Itrsquos important to do it in a way that avoids injury, sopeople are taking up running, wersquod encourage them to follow a programme that helps them do it gradually and safely.

I feel overall [lockdown and isolation] is going to hold a lot of stuff back and itll take me longer to get to grips with it all.\"Tips on living with griefIn the aftermath of death, it is important to remember that grief is normal and although painful, will get better as time passes.Seek help from any close family members or friends ndash either practical or emotional. Grief can be lonely, so try to maintain connection with people.Sleep when you can, evenonly for a few hours at a time. It is well known that grief frequently disturbs normal sleeping patterns, and can bring unusual or disturbing dreams, and the lack of sleep can be exhausting. If this persists, speak with your doctor.Avoid tasks that require concentration, when our concentration is not as sharp as usual, thoughts of what has happened can flood our minds, making tasks such as driving dangerous.If you canrsquot face eating, just try small snacks little and often and remember to drink not to become dehydrated. Alcohol is best avoided.Talk about how you are feeling. Grief can be overwhelming, it is common to question the meaning of our own lives following a death, and thoughts of suicide are not unusual either.Dont expect too much of yourself. Grief is a major event and affects us in many ways.For support call Cruse Bereavement Scotland on    "},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

Then again, north, south, east or west, and whenever it happens, the basic question on school reopening is the same: Is it safe As is often the case when a steady hand on the tiller is required, the UK Government dispatched Michael Gove, Minister for the Cabinet Office, to Marr and Sky Newsrsquo Ridge on Sunday, this week hosted by Niall Paterson .Marr began by askingthe Minister could guarantee teachers [and pupils] would be safe. ldquoYes, came the unequivocal answer. As time went on, however, the interview became more of a discussion about risk and whether it could ever be eliminated.ldquoThe only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely, said Mr Gove.ldquoBut there is always, always, always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching the coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk. It is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak.On Ridge on Sunday, Mr Gove said the UK could learn from best practice where.ldquoOther countries have succeeded in ensuring children canto school safely. The nature of what happens in the classroom has changed.ldquoInstead of children working around the table they are sitting at desks separate from each other and, as a result, they are able to learn, they are able to benefit from being in school.ldquoWe recognise this requires careful working with teachers.

This includes the establishment of a joint ministerial committee to discuss the ongoing pandemic and its management.A statement, released this afternoon, Thursday, on behalf of Alistair Carmichael MP and Lord Jim Wallace of Tankerness said: “Across the country, people are worried about their loved ones and their jobs in light of coronavirus – and they are getting mixed messages from governments.”In a time of crisis, confusion and inconsistency breed fear and put people at risk. A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The UK is currently the co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition. We have a duty to uphold universal human rights.“Earlier this year I welcomed the legalisation of same sex marriage in Northern Ireland. I am proud that the Liberal Democrats have led the way in supporting equal rights. We legislated for same-sex marriage while in government and continue the fight for equality at home and internationally.”He continued: “There may be further to go but UK has made signicant strides on the road to equality.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England.

It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

He#s down there six nights of the week, has his half a dozen drams and gets a taxi home. He#s loved by regulars and visitors alike.#Everyone takes him under their wing # he#s a lovely man.#He took a turn after the new year and lost his confidence and ended up in a nursing home in Strontian. He then came back to Skye and went to Home Farm.“I contact him every Saturday to have a blether with him, but then Coronavirus struck.#However, I phoned and his nurse and carer said he was doing well. I then spoke to Norman and was chatting about this that and the other and said ‘you#ll be missing your mackerel and herring’, and he said #I#d rather mackerel’.#Norman#s request quickly sent his peers from the Pier into action and what would soon become known as ‘Operation Mackerel’ was up and running.#I put a blog up on the Pier Hotel Facebook page where I update people about how Norman#s doing,# said Sandy.#I mentioned that he was missing a bit of mackerel and the next thing I know I had several offers of mackerel from the village here all the way up to Uig.#I contacted Home Farm to seethey would accept some mackerel coming into the home for Norman and they said it would be no problem at all.#I expected two or three mackerel but Gordon McCririck gave me  fillets courtesy of Just Hooked fishmongers to take up to the home.#Sandy added: #Lo and behold I came home to see a photo of Norman tucking into his two mackerel and potatoes on Facebook.“It delighted a great number of people from the Pier Hotel to see Norman looking so well and sitting having what he asked for – and all thanks to the generosity of Gordon McCririck and Just Hooked.#Speaking to the Free Press, Norman#s niece Christina MacTaggart said: #The old man was absolutely delighted.“The nurse that has been looking after him has been fantastic, she took a fantastic photo of him and I had to share it with the ones from the Pier Hotel.#We had his th birthday party down at the Pier last year. I came up from Oban and when I walked in the place was absolutely bouncing.“It just showed how well thought of he is.“The staff and the customers there are like his family, they all look after him # I get up to Skye as much as I possibly can but they are fantastic with him.#Commenting on the love and care her uncle has received, she said: #He always wanted to come back to Portree.“He#s as happy as Larry there. The staff that have been looking after him have been absolutely amazing # because I am in Oban they have been an absolute god-send to me.“They keep me well informed, let me Facetime him so we can speak.#The girl looking after him # Claire is her name # she has gone beyond the call of duty and been brilliant.#He is in the home, and although all this has happened, it hasn#t changed our mind in any way or made us want him to be anywhere .#The staff have been risking their own lives and in a small community, it just makes it so much harder.”While Norman#s love of fish is well known, according to his great-niece, there is perhaps another key ingredient to his longevity.Christina explained: #My -year-old daughter was asked to talk at school about someone who inspired her and she told the class #my uncle from Skye, he has reached .

Of the  staff the council had considered making redundant,  will now be furloughed.SDLP councillor Ryan Wilson said the decision had spared the council from making hundreds of redundancies, but he was disappointed staff wouldn#t have their pay topped up, as other councils had done.He added: The council is clearly under financial pressure and the Minister for Communities must make additional funding available to ensure ratepayers do not bear this burden, either by a large increase of rates or a depletion of services.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council said it expected to lose about £m this financial year, but had no plans to cut back services. It added: To be in a position to sustain service levels into the future and emerge with a feasible long-term plan for economic recovery, greater financial assistance from central government will be required.Meanwhile, Mid Ulster District Council said furloughing just over a third of its workforce would reduce April losses from £, to just over £,.Solace NI, the body of council chief executives, warned last week that local authorities here could run out of cash for staff and suppliers within monthsthey did not get the support they needed.Belfast Most ReadFisheries staff given insufficient time to prepare for safeof angling: MLACommunity gathers to remember Clare and Bethany Smyth after quad bike tragedy Orcas swim alongside boat in Northern Ireland in rare and ‘stunning’ sightingBittersweet homecoming for virus survivor Geoffrey McKillop as he hears lelong friend and her daughter died in quad bike crashCoronavirus updates: Four further deaths in Northern Ireland ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sharma has announced further funding for vaccine research  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma has announced further funding for vaccine research By Gavin Cordon, PA Whitehall EditorMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Government is investing a further £ million in the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine as ministers announced a ground-breaking deal which could make millions of doses available in the UK as early as September.Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the additional funding would support teams at Oxford University and Imperial College London engaged in the global race to find a vaccine that could finally end the devastating pandemic.At the same time, he said Oxford had signed a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca which could see it supply  million doses of a vaccine – with  million going to the UK – as soon as Septemberone has been found by then.“The UK will be first to get access but we can also ensure that in addition to supporting people here in the UK we’re able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost,” he told the daily No  press briefing.While the announcement will be seen as a boost to hopes of finding a vaccine, Boris Johnson earlier cautioned that there was still a lot to do and that the search may never be successful.Writing in The Mail on Sunday, he said: “There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition.”Mr Sharma said, however, that trials of the Oxford vaccine were “progressing well” with the phase one participants having received their doses earlier this week.“The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented,” he said.He said the additional research funding would help with the mass production of the vaccine so thattrials are successful “we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away”.In a further move, he said that the Government was putting in £ million to accelerate the completion of the UK’s first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre.The facility at Harwell in Oxfordshire –  which is already under construction – is now expected to open in summer , a year ahead of schedule.Mr Sharma said that once it was operating it would have the capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months.In the event that a vaccine was found before then, he said the Government was providing £ million to build a “rapid deployment facility” which will be able to start manufacturing “at scale” from this summer.“The UK continues to lead the global response to find a vaccine, and the Government is backing our scientists to do this as quickly as possible,” he said.Howeverthe search for a vaccine was not successful, he said they were also looking at other drug treatments and therapeutics, with six drugs having entered initial live clinical trials.The announcements came as the latest Department of Health figures showed , people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of pm on

You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it’s extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak.“If for any reason there are risks then we can take steps to mitigate them.”Mr Gove said there are “big lessons” to be learned from the treatment of care homes during the outbreak amid growing criticism of the lack of Government support for the sector.While “signicant steps” had been taken to improve the situation, he said it remained a “challenge”.“We are still living through this pandemic and there will be lessons to be learned,” he said.“There will be a point in the future when all of us can look back and reflect and make sure we have learned the appropriate lessons.”PAMost ReadCovid- is deepening inequalities, says LGBT charityHottest day of the year expected with temperature forecast to hit CUK’s wealthiest lose billions to pandemic as Sir James Dyson tops Rich ListJeremy Corbyn’s brother among arrests at anti-lockdown protestsNavy launches probe after leak on board aircraft carrier,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

It was announced yesterday that fishing will be allowed as part of the easing of the lockdown restrictions. Glenowen Fisheries, which is based within Creggan Country Park, will be among the local facilities to re-open next. A spokesperson for the fisheries stressed that people would need to pre-book and pre-pay before arriving at the facility. Fisheries Minister Edwin Poots has confirmed that the Public Angling Estatewill gradually re-open to local anglers from Monday. Thirty PAE’s across Northern Ireland will re-open to the public for recreational use, but anglers should only use the DAERA facilities within their local area and should not travel long distances. Minister Poots also confirmed that car parking facilities will remain closed until  May . googletag.cmd.push Speaking about the announcement, the Minister said:“In the interests of public health, I shut down the angling estate on  March, to discourage unnecessary journeys and protect my staff as well as anglers themselves, given that the majority are in the + age bracket and many have concessionary angling licences due to underlying health issues. “While car parks will remain closed until  May to discourage long journeys, I have decided to permit local anglers back on to the Public Angling Estate so that they can participate in their favourite recreational activity. “By its nature, angling is a solo sport or hobby, and its participants can enjoy a day’s fishing without being in close contact with others. The sport has huge benefits for people’s mental and physical well-being and in this time of uncertainty, I know that many people have missed the solitude and peace that angling and being outdoors with nature, brings them. googletag.cmd.push “However, let me be clear – anglers must continue to follow social distancing guidelines, practice good hand hygiene and walk to their nearest PAE, fishing alone or with a member of their own household. I do not want to see crowds of people near the river banks and fisheries.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee.

This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area.

Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The borough’s five other sitesare to reopen at an unspecied later date.Addressing this plan, the Director acknowledgedthat the Executive’s announcementhad changed the nature of the debate.“There was an announcement this afternoon [Thursday] from the Executive that said travelling to recycling centres is, from Monday, an appropriate reason for travel,” said Mr Parkinson.“With that in mind, what I would suggest to members is that we progress with the proposed model initially. However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "}]
