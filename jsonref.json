Olsen’s UK Head Office has been sent to the island to assist these guests while we secure a new departure date for their cruise.           It comes after the MSC Meraviglia was turned away from two ports in the Jamaica and the Cayman Islands after a crew member fell sick         The Meraviglia was eventually allowed to dock in Cozumel, Mexico (pictured), on Friday after the crew member and another passenger tested negative for coronavirus\u0027We are keeping all guests, both on board and ashore, fully informed at all times.\u0027We believe that the refusal for us to commence debarkation operations in the Port of La Romana was the result of a very small number of influenza-like cases on board. \u0027Our medical team has confirmed that they are all feeling better. \u0027No guests or crew are, or have been, displaying symptoms that are considered to be consistent with those of coronavirus.\u0027  The cruise line\u0027s website shows the ship was due to dock in the Dominican Republic to drop off a load of passengers after a 14-day voyage.It would then pick up another load and set off on a new cruise on Thursday night.The MSC Meraviglia did eventually dock at Mexico\u0027s Caribbean island of Cozumel on Thursday and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said passengers would be allowed to disembark,Mr Lopez Obrador said Mexico had to act with \u0027humanity\u0027 after the ship was refused entry at ports in Grand Cayman and Jamaica.The cruise line had expressed frustration with the rejections, which came after it reported one crew member from the Philippines was sick with common seasonal flu. It said no passengers had shown evidence of the covid-19 virus.\u0027The ship is being allowed to dock and the passengers, those who are aboard the cruise ship can disembark,\u0027 Mr Lopez Obrador said, adding that health inspections will be carried out.         It also comes after a coronavirus outbreak on board the Diamond Princess ship (pictured) sickened almost 700 amid a failed attempt to confine people to their cabins         Six people - including a British man - have died after catching coronavirus on board the vessel, before being evacuated (file image)\u0027We cannot act with discrimination,\u0027 he said. \u0027Imagine if a ship arrived and it wasn\u0027t even allowed to dock, and they were told, \u0027Keep going on your way, see where you can dock.\u0027 That is inhuman.\u0027He added: \u0027We cannot close our ports, nor can we close our airports.\u0027\u0027Imagine the desperation and everything it implies, almost 5,000 people on a ship and they cannot get off,\u0027 he said. \u0027Why such backward attitudes?\u0027The case of the Meraviglia illustrated the crisis of nerves over the virus. Mexico has no confirmed cases and MSC Cruises said the crew member had only common seasonal flu, had been placed in isolation and had \u0027nearly recovered\u0027.Local media showed a small knot of Cozumel residents near the cruise ship dock demanding that passengers not be allowed to disembark, citing fears about potential contagion or effects on the tourism-dependent economy.Just minutes after Mr Lopez Obrador spoke on Thursday, the governor of the Quintana Roo state, where Cozumel is located, confirmed the ship had docked, but said \u0027no authorisation has been given\u0027 yet for passengers to disembark.Governor Carlos Joaquin wrote that health inspections would have to be carried out first."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/11/07/4EC18F1B00000578-0-image-a-10_1533967519895.jpg","title":"Thousands children prepare head Greta Thunbergs Bristol climate rally","story":"Share this articleSchool statement on \u0027adults coercing youths to march\u0027 ahead of Greta Thunberg Bristol protest - Bristol Live"},{"url":null,"title":"Solicitor joked novichok interview Russian speaker didnt job","story":"Share this article She found that, although Mr Levy\u0027s \u0027remark about poisoning may not have endeared him to Ms Udalova-Surkova,\u0027 his age was \u0027the principle reason\u0027 he was turned down.She pointed to notes from an internal board meeting which stated his wage level as an older and more experienced solicitor made him \u0027too expensive\u0027 and went on to order the firm to pay him £13,187.83 compensation, including £4,000 for \u0027injury to feelings\u0027.The judge said that Mr Levy, who was admitted as a solicitor in 1985 at the age of 24, had attended an interview on 7 March 2018 at one of McHale\u0027s offices in the north- west, after seeing an advert for a vacancy in the Law Society Gazette.Explaining the Novichok incident, the judge said: \u0027Before the interview started, Mr Levy was in the firm\u0027s reception area and accepted the offer of a drink.         Mr Levy\u0027s interview came at the time of the poisoning in Salisbury of Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Pictured: Crime scene investigators walk in hazmat suits in the town\u0027The television in reception was showing the news and there was a report about the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury.\u0027As Ms Udalova-Surkova greeted Mr Levy to take him downstairs to the room where the interview was going to take place, he made a comment to the effect of, I hope you aren\u0027t going to poison me.\u0027He did not make reference to her Russian nationality and was not directing the remark at her personally, but was prompted to make what he saw as a joke by the news report.\u0027Ms Udalova-Surkova was taken aback by the comment but said nothing in response and the interview went ahead without further reference to it.\u0027Mr Levy (was) interviewed, though he was then not offered the position.\u0027Going on to the age discrimination issue, the judge said: \u0027Mr Levy asserted that this was direct discrimination in that the firm rejected him because he was too old and they wanted a younger candidate.\u0027The firm undoubtedly did not offer Mr Levy the job he applied for and so the heart of the case revolved around the question: if there was less favourable treatment, what was the reason for it? In particular, was that reason discriminatory?\u0027Mr Levy\u0027s remark about poisoning may not have endeared him to Ms Udaloza-Surkova, but it did not represent an obstacle to his appointment.\u0027(The firm) expressed some concern about Mr Levy\u0027s remark about poisoning, as if to suggest that the comment had factored in their reasons for not making an offer (but) Mr Levy\u0027s age was the reason or principle reason for the decision not to appoint him.\u0027A representative of the firm had explicitly stated that \u0027the reason the firm did not employ him was nothing to do with his remark before the interview,\u0027 the judge said.\u0027The tribunal felt that the respondent firm has little understanding or awareness of discrimination legislation,\u0027 the judge said, criticising the firm\u0027s \u0027lack of formal training in ersity and equality issues\u0027 and \u0027complacency and its aggressive defence of the claim.\u0027The firm, which published an employee handbook and equality policy stating \u0027everyone is welcome,\u0027 had made \u0027threats to report Mr Levy to the Solicitors Regulation Authority\u0027 over his complaints. The judge said the threats \u0027were revealing of an employer which is impervious to the possibility that it may have discriminated, even without appreciating it has done so.\u0027\u0027Rather than keep an open mind and negotiate terms with Mr Levy the firm instead deprived him of an opportunity to obtain work at a time when he was unemployed.\u0027The direct discrimination claim succeeds,\u0027 the judge concluded. "},{"url":null,"title":"Moment girl confronts Boots worker accuses sleeping father","story":"Share this article And the customer shows no sign of giving in and she taps the screen of the phone and says: \u0027This is your address isn\u0027t it?

But, ahead of a Tate Britain show, we look at the pictures that were deemed just too outrageous. WARNING: explicit contentA woman who is naked except for fancy stockings touches what the artist calls her “coynte” while a winged cupid teases her bottom with a powder puff. A wizened man admires a young man’s elephantine erection, the glans as big as his bald head – all delineated in sharp black outlines and shadowed with inky pools against expanses of white. These are a few of the many explosions of obscenity that a slender, pale young man created in the room he checked into at the Spread Eagle hotel in Epsom, Surrey, in June 1896.The drawings Aubrey Beardsley completed in this suburban hideaway were to illustrate the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes. The works, that can be perused at your leisure in Tate Britain’s forthcoming exhibition, had an incalculable effect on the birth of modern art. Beardsley’s eroticism would soon be emulated all over Europe by revolutionaries such as Klimt, Schiele and Picasso, while James Joyce summed up his impact on modernism in a double entendre: “Kunstfull”.That isn’t generally how this unique artist is remembered, though. Beardsley is pigeonholed as a preciously eccentric purveyor of late-Victorian erotica. Rediscovered in the 1960s, when both Victoriana and sex were fashionable, he hovers in the subconscious of British art. His name sounds posh, which adds to the air of whimsy, but he was born into an economically unstable lower-middle-class family in Brighton in 1872 and left school aged 16.Beardsley was an insurance clerk before being discovered by Oscar Wilde’s first male lover, Robert Ross. This led to an artistic collaboration with Wilde, but his importance goes far beyond the aesthetic movement. He put sexuality at the centre of modern art for the first time, spreading his influence across Europe – to Vienna, Paris and Barcelona – 25 years before surrealism.Then in 1895, a year before he settled in at the Spread Eagle, Beardsley’s world fell apart. Wilde was arrested and charged with gross indecency. The author’s love for Lord Alfred Douglas became a scandal and anyone associated with him was suspected of sodomy. Beardsley, at the age of 22, had been chosen by Wilde to illustrate the printed edition of his disturbing drama Salome. Following that success, he became art editor, designer and illustrator of the Yellow Book, a bestselling magazine that brought avant garde ideas into respectable homes. But when Wilde fell, its publisher John Lane sacked him. Beardsley had only recently been able to give up his day job. Now he was vilified and poverty-stricken.The poet WB Yeats, a friend of Beardsley, remembered him looking into a mirror shortly after being sacked and saying: “Yes, yes, I look like a sodomite ... but no, I am not that.” The man in the mirror was an exquisite dandy: when Beardsley became a star in 1890s London, he started wearing suits in subtly contrasting shades of grey with yellow gloves over his ethereally thin figure. Yet there is no evidence that he ever went to bed with anyone of any gender – except maybe, biographers speculate, his sister, Mabel.And here Mabel is, naked in a back room at Tate Britain. To get a sneak peak at Beardsley’s drawings, I’ve visited the museum’s Prints and Drawings Rooms. The frontispiece he designed for the collected plays of a now-forgotten writer rests on a wooden stand. Mabel Beardsley is the nude at the far left, with layers of radiating hair that look like they belong in a psychedelic poster. She is looking ecstatically at Wilde, who stands beside her dressed as the ancient wine god Bacchus. In front of them is a goat-legged faun.Sex is Beardsley’s theme and, unprovable allegations aside, it seems to have existed for him only on paper. That makes him an artist for our time. Long before the virtual and fluid sexualities of the 21st century, Beardsley created an erotic fantasy world of shifting identities and infinite variety. His art is one long act of self-pleasuring that reached its consummation on Epsom High Street.His most famous illustration for Wilde’s Salome is actually called The Climax. In this intense symbolist design, Salome has persuaded her stepfather, Herod, to have John the Baptist’s head cut off in return for gratifying his lust with an erotic dance. She can now satiate her own lust for the Baptist – or at least his lips. She floats in the air, seemingly with orgasmic joy, as black blood pours from the fetishised dead head she embraces.Does that seem an over-explicit interpretation of this great fin de siècle image? Well, you should see his rejected designs for Salome. Several scenes were deemed too dirty by the publisher and he was asked to replace them with milder versions. In his original drawing of The Toilet of Salome, a pageboy stands naked holding a tray of tea things. Another near-nude youth sits with his hand between his legs, masturbating as he gazes at the tray-carrier. Meanwhile, Salome also masturbates.Sex is all in the head. That is Beardsley’s message, and the basis of the strange game he played with Victorian censorship. The reason Salome first appeared in English as a book, rather than on stage, was because it was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain. Beardsley’s drawings mock the censor by dancing a fine line between innocence and depravity. The publisher accepted his vision of Salome’s love of a severed head, but rejected his drawing of her sitting with her back to us in a dressing gown that’s open. What was the problem? She holds a conductor’s baton.Before he got sacked from the Yellow Book, Beardsley filled the widely read magazine with similar suggestiveness. His illustration A Night Piece shows a woman in a long black dress and gloves and a thin black ribbon round her white throat walking down a dark city street – she is, in Victorian parlance, a woman of the night. In another picture, called L’Éducation Sentimentale, a young woman is listening attentively to her older friend. Both have tough, pinched faces. It’s not a sentimental but a sexual education set in a brothel.Beardsley pictured his audience as young women. On the cover he designed for the Yellow Book’s publicity leaflet, his imagined female reader studies the latest volumes outside a bookshop. She looks rapt, for Beardsley depicts reading itself as the most subversive of pleasures. In his revised version of The Toilet of Salome, she has Émile Zola’s novel Nana on her bookshelves – a “dirty French novel”, as Lou Reed would later put it. The Yellow Book was yellow to evoke the typical covers of sexy French fiction. Wilde wrote Salome in French, intoxicated by the writings of Flaubert, Huysmans and Baudelaire. Beardsley was equally au fait, regularly taking the boat train to Paris. French artists loved him back: Toulouse-Lautrec ordered three copies of his illustrated Salome.When Beardsley checked in to the Spread Eagle hotel, he’d just come back from Brussels, another capital of fin de siècle culture. There he probably encountered the explicit art of Félicien Rops, including his 1878 gouache Pornocrates, in which a pig is held on a leash by a naked woman wearing a blindfold and black stockings. On the way back from the Belgian capital, Beardsley fell seriously ill. It was to get out of London’s smog that he fled to Epsom. He had known since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis when he was seven years old that his life would be limited. In the two years following his stay in Epsom, he would travel to France in search of better health, dying at Menton on the Riviera in 1898, aged 25.As his young life entered its premature twilight, he found sensual solace in Aristophanes’ Lysistrata, a play about love defeating death – or, in Greek, Eros defeating Thanatos. Aristophanes wrote it during a murderous war between Athens and Sparta that seemed to have no end. He imagines the women of both cities refusing to have sex with their husbands to stop the war. Beardsley turns this sex strike into an orgiastic triumph of lust over despair. Even as they listen to a speech, his Greek women can’t stop fondling each other. A Spartan woman gleefully taunts her lust-crippled husband with her body. Men gather in a mass display of monumental members.We tend to analyse erotic art in terms of power, but for Beardsley it was quite simply a matter of life and death.• Aubrey Beardsley is at Tate Britain, London, 4 March to 25 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0082ad7c3efeca1539f349b5c32d10fe4b1ad547/0_762_12150_7290/master/12150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fcf5d688a2b4a286cffadd4f1205ec5","title":"own a guardian classic photograph abandoned car peak district 1979","story":"This week’s photograph in our weekly archive print series is a wintry image of a Mini abandoned in the snow and surrounded by sheep, shot by Don McPheeA Mini appears to have careered off the road and been abandoned in heavy snow near Buxton, in Derbyshire.  photographer Don McPhee captured the image in January 1979.

I’m going to be talking about love, comedy, writing and everything in between: I understand that nothing’s out of bounds at the Primadonna festival (what a challenge!). And I can’t wait to meet readers and aspiring writers who are also excited by what Primadonna’s all about.”The international bestselling author, whose books include Watermelon and The Mystery of Mercy Close, is already married. But that is no bar.“It’s not only for single people. We’re happy to have conventionally coupled-up people marry at the Primadonna wedding chapel: only not to each other, just themselves,” said the broadcaster, comedian and author Sandi Toksvig, one of the co-founders of Primadonna.“The point is to show a commitment to being kind and good to the most important person in your life: you.”For the winner of the prize draw, Primadonna will provide the cake, the confetti and the congregation. “It’ll be much cheaper – and a lot more fun – than getting a wedding planner,” said Toksvig.On self-partnering, Toksvig added: “We like the message behind Watson’s headlines, which is that being in a relationship does not define a person as successful or approved or socially acceptable.“We set up Primadonna to create a space where we can push back against mainstream messaging like this that damages women in particular. And we’re fundraising to make what we do sustainable, so that more people can share in the Primadonna vibe of creativity and equality and fun. So we’re saying that this 29 February, let us be your significant other.”The festival, held at Laffitts Hall at Pettaugh, near Stowmarket, will feature writers, comedians, musicians, artists and other creatives with an emphasis on spotlighting female writers and voices from the margins. A full lineup is yet to be announced.The winner of the first Primadonna prize for unsigned and unrepresented new writing talent will be announced on Monday 2 March at a special event hosted by Toksvig."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f6e953189c3fac583c1cd4f5cc9b2a1c59a367/0_6_2876_1725/master/2876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2e7ecc38fd3adf36b46ba02b3ad98c0","title":"japanese minister goes lebanon press carlos ghosn return nissan","story":"Hiroyuki Yoshiie will meet officials to make case for ex-Nissan boss to be tried in JapanJapan’s deputy justice minister is travelling to Lebanon this weekend to make the case for the fugitive ex-Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn to be tried in Japan.Hiroyuki Yoshiie will leave Tokyo on Saturday and meet the Lebanese justice minister, Marie-Claude Najm, on Monday, Japan’s justice ministry said.The former leader of the Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance made a sensational escape last year from Japan, where he faces trial for financial crimes, including misuse of Nissan funds for personal benefit.

We must continue and we have to be patient. Remember that the changes required will not happen overnight.”Thunberg arrived in Bristol by train and was driven to the climate strike in a red Nissan Leaf electric car.Wearing a yellow raincoat and woolly hat – a look copied by some of her devotees – she took to the stage to chants of “Greta, Greta” from schoolchildren and teenagers.She told them: “We will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not. This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power.“Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire.”Thunberg flagged up the recent decision by north Somerset council to oppose Bristol airport expansion as an example of what could be achieved if activists worked together.The Swedish teenager went on to join protesters on a march through the city centre accompanied by a samba band. She waved at well-wishers and at one point consoled a child who was clearly overwhelmed by the experience.Avon and Somerset police had warned of the potential for protesters to be hurt and urged parents not to allow children to go unaccompanied.Bristol Cathedral, which sits on College Green, was ready to open its doors to anyone needing refuge but the organisers insisted they had put enough measures in place to make sure nobody was hurt.Emily said: “I think it’s really important that people understand what is happening to the Earth.” She was returning to school after the event to give a presentation on climate change.Isaac and Maya Swann, 11 and 15, had persuaded their mother, Karen Davies, to bring them along. Maya said: “We want to help make a change. Greta’s really brave and inspirational, giving up part of her childhood to spread this message. It was cold and wet but it is was worth it. It was exciting to see how many people care.”Davies said: “I was against them taking time off school but last night they came to me and said they felt if I was their age I would be there. They were right. I’d be in the thick of it. I sent an email to the school and they were supportive. I think many schools see it as educational. It was a lovely experience … It’s good to see that so many people can be inspired by one girl.”Hannah Burge, 12, and Harvey Hennessy, 16, have organised school strikes in Barnstaple, north Devon. Their biggest turnout has been 850. “It’s been amazing seeing so many people here,” said Hannah. “Greta is such a role model for us.”Mya-Rose Craig, 17, an ornithologist who recently became the youngest person in the UK to be awarded an honorary doctorate, said: “It’s so cool to see so many thousands of young people here ready to fight for our future.”Ed Thompson, a housemaster at Clifton college, took overseas boarders aged 11-13 and the school’s “green team” to the event. He said: “We have discussed Greta’s influence in school, and she is a true icon to all ages for her passion, determination, tenacity and likability. The word ‘inspiration’ is too often used, but she is a guiding light to the next generation for peaceful but powerful activism, and encouraging love and care for our environment, which is such a strong message for young people.”The crowd was swollen by many students who were missing lectures, tutorials and lab sessions. But it was not just young people who attended. There were groups of doctors, nurses and even a collective of wildlife film-makers.One moment of tension came when police equipped with video cameras moved through the crowd pointing their lenses at strikers, including a group from the Public and Commercial Services Union.Some employers had turned a blind eye to workers taking time to attend.

Flat at the front, with a tight black panel running from the abdomen to the throat, it puffed out at the hips and lower belly around the curve of a deep scooped bodice.That unfamiliar shape was presented three times, in forest green, cobalt blue and buttercream brocade, on the Loewe catwalk. Other novel shapes followed: three more gowns with tight black bodices, in cinnamon, cream and electric blue, covered the upper torso with a large off-the-shoulder ruffle, and sprouted out, in a cascade of brocade, at the mid-back. Later there were three dresses with drop shoulders, balloon sleeves and a drop waist at the side of which were two pannier-like points of fabric.“I was looking at building new kinds of silhouettes that can work in an abstract world,” said the creative director, Jonathan Anderson, backstage. “I like the idea of creating a totemic look,” he continued, describing it as “a fashion silhouette – pushed and experimental”.Loewe is a brand that is comfortable with weirdness. Its unconventional designs appeal to fashion heads who swoon over challenging shapes the way jazz fans thrill over certain configurations of grace notes. It is not, however, a brand that fills its catwalks with objets d’art designed to provoke thought but not to be worn, in the manner of a label such as Comme des Garçons.Being the ultimate label for the craft-obsessed wealthy gallerist crowd, the Spanish leather house is a huge source of highly covetable handbags – the puzzle and the balloon have become modern classics – and is a reliable source of trends. In a few seasons’ time, will our eyes acclimatise and these shapes end up in our wardrobes? Stranger things have happened.Further luxurious oddities came via a collaboration with the Japanese ceramicist Takuro Kuwata, whose “crater-like, meticulous” designs became “engineered panels” – as Anderson called them – that were embedded into gowns. He also made charms the size of a fist that looked like mutated flower heads, which hung from bags and around the neck of one of the models.There were plenty of more straight-up commercial pieces on the catwalk, too, such as the ruched flamenco bags, the covetable trench coats with thick tweed collars, camel-coloured trapeze coats with contrasting dove grey sleeves and neat black skirt suits with gold-buttoned jackets featuring subtle peplums. The shoes – kitten heels and loafers – looked like commercial winners, coming with bejewelled shoe clips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf9cfb2cd01fff9acc53cdfa6dca7e2c2de3350/0_273_6647_3989/master/6647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d0f5885d979c300850db541eb869c0a","title":"wendy benh zeitlin what went wrong","story":"After breaking out with Beasts of the Southern Wild, Benh Zeitlin has stumbled with his misjudged take on Peter PanIt’s a tale as old as time, or at least as old as Hollywood: a hotshot young director scores on their first outing and, awash with accolades and flattering box-office receipts, goes out to make their big follow-up. Then … nothing. The curse of the sophomore slump strikes, leaving a once-promising talent on the skids, their initial flickers of greatness now called into question. The latest retelling of this narrative also happens to be one of the most stark, in terms of the distance between a hit’s point A and a bellyflop’s point B. This week, the new film Wendy becomes the latest spurned by that fickle mistress show business.Back in the heady days of 2012, rookie film-maker Benh Zeitlin (born Ben H Zeitlin) was enjoying the kind of rarefied success that most fresh-faced film school grads can only fantasize about. He had completed his debut feature Beasts of the Southern Wild and landed a plum premiere slot at the Sundance film festival, where he took Park City, Utah, by storm. His film quickly emerged as a can’t-miss breakout, and to cement his reputation as revelation, he won the Grand Jury prize. Fox Searchlight took notice and snapped up the distribution rights in a low-seven-figures deal, then brought the film to Cannes, where Zeitlin picked up the Camera d’Or award for the best first film. More festival appearances and mounting word-of-mouth led to a handsome payday upon the release that summer, with a $23.3m haul dwarfing his $1.8m budget.By the end of the year, he was a fixture on critics’ best-of lists, and the Oscars were to be his victory lap. He landed four nominations, including best director and best picture (The film’s nine-year-old star, Quvenzhané Wallis, claimed the title of youngest ever performer nominated for best actress.) Though he didn’t win any, his presence at the Dolby Theatre that night was victory enough. There was his name, right next to Steven Spielberg’s. He had made it.He sure seemed to be on the fast track to the top as he detailed plans for his second project, a fable about a girl whisked away to a remote island, in early 2013. But the following years elapsed without a peep until 2015, when the film industry sounded a collective “Oh, yeah, that guy!” upon hearing news that Zeitlin was finally prepared to start production on Wendy. For those with a loose grasp of mathematics or time, that was five years ago, practically an eternity by showbiz metrics.Delay after delay left those invested in his career wondering whether maybe this would be the year he would return to Sundance, and this past January, it was. If he was feeling any deja vu, the premiere’s frosty reception would have cured him of that straight away. He went from darling to also-ran, and judging by Searchlight’s pre-assigned release date a couple of short weeks after the festival, the studio didn’t have too much faith in him to start with. In New York, Wendy has now been shuffled into two measly theaters, one of which this critic visited last night. The opening showing was, to put it charitably, sparsely attended. What could have possibly happened?A tell-all feature in IndieWire running shortly before Wendy’s bow at Sundance dispelled any notion of behind-the-scenes calamity, with Zeitlin claiming that he simply likes to take his time with preliminary research and post-production. At the end of the day, he made the movie he wanted to make – the only trouble was that after so much of the time afforded to him, he wasn’t really making the movie that America wanted any more.The DOA release speaks as much to changing tastes in the public as it does to Zeitlin’s slipping abilities. Wendy does illustrate how essential Beasts’ stabilizing parent-child dynamic was to its functioning, preferable to a gaggle of screaming kids all playing off of one another. And it appears that the mediating influence of Beasts’ screenwriter, Lucy Alibar (who also penned the play on which the film was based), counts for a bit, judging by the decline in the latest script ginned up by Zeitlin and his sister, Eliza. But Zeitlin’s real bugaboo extends beyond his control – his cinema has fallen out of vogue.A big component of Beasts’ initial success was the conversation surrounding it, which conferred its reputation as a raw transmission from the Louisiana heartland. Zeitlin drew much attention for hiring non-professional actors, most notable among them an area donut shop proprietor named Dwight Henry, who wowed audiences with his innate skill as the film’s second lead. He had fresh memories of starting over after Hurricane Katrina, the other part of Beasts’ winning formula. The social resonance of displaced rural populations and ramshackle government recovery centers lent the film an air of relevance and maturity that has not aged quite so well.Much of the reflection on Beasts places the focus on Zeitlin’s gifts as a formalist, whether that’s the radiant glow of the golden-hour cinematography or the rousing, oft-imitated score. The American public’s slightly refined sense of racial politics hasn’t shone quite so kindly on the film’s subtext, which sees a white director positioning his black characters as the magical half of a tale of magical realism. Wendy runs along similar lines, retelling the Peter Pan myth as a story of white youngsters taking refuge on an enchanted island people by little black children living happy and uncivilized. Rejecting the bondage of grownup society to be untamed and anarchic represents a central tenet of the philosophy Zeitlin’s conveying here, and the noticeable isions in the cast suggest an unfortunate subtext. The director tells stories about black life from the outside-in, and the critical establishment has at least partially wised up. An increased presence of black voices and a heightened awareness from the white ones both converged to remove Zeitlin from the zeitgeist.Barring some triumphant comeback with his next major work, by no means an impossibility, the director will occupy the outskirts of the field he once stood poised to conquer. Though for all we know, that will sit just fine with him. Zeitlin’s a proud New Orleanian, and has spent a goodly amount of time producing work for up-and-coming film-makers in the region. (Phillip Youmans’ indie gem Burning Cane wouldn’t have been possible without Zeitlin’s help.) He’s not nearly out of the game, but he’s never really conferred the impression of a game-player. Like the rambunctious kids on which he trains his camera, he seems content to luxuriate in the splendor of nature and run around releasing primal yawps. In other words, he makes his movies for himself. For some, it’s a strategy that guarantees they never lose their singular touch as an artist. For Zeitlin, it ensures that he’ll never evolve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1069f471ad09079e8f3d81fa8c1341f6fc71bb/690_574_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=482bd4296e82aecd66755a37d525afcf","title":"what noma did next new nordic food rene redzepi claus meyer locavore foraging","story":"In our time of climate crisis and inequality, as top chefs dream less of Michelin stars and more of changing the world, the New Nordic movement is reaching beyond haute cuisine into classrooms, supermarkets and parliaments. By  Kieran MorrisFew restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of “Nomaheads” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms.Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals – made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen – that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma’s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark’s prisons to reduce reciism, and he is partnering with Ikea – which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world – to “veganise” its menu.Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation’s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma’s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation’s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time.Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region’s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad – it means “food” in Danish – that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production.There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become “a Bauhaus of food”, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it – a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: “How do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?”It’s as if Fergus Henderson took his “nose-to-tail” philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food.Chefs were once courtiers then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics – vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l’oeil flourishes.The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adrià, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. José Andrés, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life.Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters’ groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way – even if it means paying more for that produce.Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds.But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing “more than just cooking” the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That’s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Joël Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma – often referred to as Noma 2.0 – just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original.Still, the movement – and the restaurant at its forefront – has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that “its borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn’t feel quite right for the present age more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.”The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement’s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have “exerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve”.Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. “Back then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,” the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. “There was no Danish food culture.”One of the New Nordic movement’s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark’s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country’s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France’s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. “I realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,” Meyer told me. “I found that so crazy.”So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma – the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (“Nordic food”) – with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region’s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 – a 10-point mission statement that sought “to express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region”.Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi’s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia’s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a “Nordic food culture”.What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma’s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined “eras” of haute cuisine – from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adrià, recognising the end of his restaurant’s journey.El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adrià’s at the height of El Bulli’s fame. Noma’s innovation was borrowing Adrià’s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible.Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space – which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant – developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary bioersity of Scandinavia.Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal’s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. “We’d be as scientific as chefs could be,” Williams said. “We’d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we’d been rigorous.” Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: “Things from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game – we didn’t just operate around a kilometre’s radius around Copenhagen.”A lot of what the lab worked with – Øland wheat flour, æggeblomme (“egg yolk”) potatoes and other native varietals – had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab’s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again.At the peak of Noma’s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers – everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan’s most celebrated soba noodle maker – would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland.These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other’s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands.In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to “unite a global cooking community with a social conscience”. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (“wild food”), to help users find what’s edible in their local park.Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and bioersity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia’s fauna and flora to create the restaurant’s idiosyncratic cuisine – llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa – and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant’s primary objective: training the restaurant’s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands.To do this, Gustu opened two Manq’a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food – one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia’s second city, El Alto. Manq’a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry exceptional students, such as Gustu’s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq’a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over £1.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from.Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq’a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia’s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country.Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls “social gastronomy” with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded iniduals in cooking and hospitality skills.Others, such as Noma’s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day – beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It’s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma.The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshaleøen is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli.Roberto Flore, former head of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia.Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world’s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region – including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration.When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto’s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male – all the signatories were men – and too focused on “encouraging cooperation” rather than challenging the region’s industrial food producers through legislation and policy.At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark’s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto’s toothlessness. “The manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret’s annual New Year’s speech,” Plum said. “There are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.”Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe’s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live.That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia’s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic.Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. “We’ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,” says Dan Giusti. “But there’s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven’t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there’s no telling how big the change could be.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51d6484100772a33540808141f828ac06c2c9dc/207_226_3375_2026/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e4bf20a1d446ff3bf7ff1946e02370","title":"norwich leicester premier league ","story":"Against the great escapologists of old Norwich pulled off a crucial win that suddenly brings a Houdini act of their own into view. Nobody expects them to emulate Leicester in steaming on to win next season’s Premier League but survival this year now seems achievable after Jamal Lewis’s superb 70th-minute goal settled a game that fizzed and popped throughout. Back in 2014-15 Leicester began eating into a seven-point deficit with nine games to play by that measure Norwich are two matches ahead of schedule and a season that had all but been written off as a learning experience pulsates, at least for a week or so, with fresh life.Inhibition has generally been the least of Norwich’s problems but Daniel Farke had been criticised for leaving their gifted, if mercurial, creative force Emi Buendia on the bench for the last three games. Farke had suggested his side win more points without the Argentinian but, with reward tending to require significant risk in straits like these, back he came into a team that had recently struggled to score from open play.If Norwich’s gloves were off, Leicester’s punch was theoretically dulled by the news that a calf injury had kept Jamie Vardy at home. They still began brightly in a game that zipped agreeably from end to end, an unmarked Hamza Choudhury heading over James Maddison’s corner in the seventh minute. Maddison was applauded by both sets of fans as he placed the ball he was the darling of these parts before his £25m move in June 2018 and, given that the money was vital in helping Farke shore up the squad that swept to promotion last year, neither party can be said to have fared badly since.Norwich have not wanted for playmakers in his absence and their latest addition, Ondrej Duda, dictated their best early work. The loanee from Hertha Berlin delivered for Ben Godfrey to nod straight at Kasper Schmeichel and then, midway through the first half, slipped Teemu Pukki through only for Caglar Soyuncu to intervene. There was no faulting their tempo on a pitch that had seen a day of rain and, as both Soyuncu and Ricardo Pereira discovered when crudely curtailing home forays, was unforgiving to mistimed lunges.A more positive contribution from Pereira almost brought the opening goal when, after a lung-busting overlap, his cross was erted on to the outside of the near post by an onrushing Dennis Praet. For the first time a pattern was developing, Leicester beginning to find their men crisply and asking most of the questions. Ayoze Pérez twisted to the byline and forced Grant Hanley to hack behind before obliging Tim Krul to grab on to a daisycutter. The best opening of all came to Vardy’s replacement, Kelechi Iheanacho, but he turned and slashed over from seven yards after controlling Pérez’s cross. An engaging enough opening period would not bring end product to match.That appeared to have been put right within four minutes of the restart when Iheanacho, latching on to a long pass before cutting inside and curling brilliantly past Krul, found his bearings in style. But it quickly became apparent that the ball had hit his arm before he took aim and the VAR decision to disallow the goal, confirmed at some length by the Stockley Park-based Graham Scott, was correct under the current numbingly austere application of the rules. Norwich have felt ill-served by the technology all season, though they are hardly alone, and the pleasure in the stands at seeing a decision go their way was keenly felt.It had nothing on the joy when Lewis, with his first Premier League goal, speared an exquisite finish across Schmeichel. Norwich had seized the initiative after Iheanacho’s disappointment, Duda twice forcing good saves from the Leicester keeper. Their tails were up and, when Max Aarons crossed beyond everyone from the right, Lewis had space to control and set his sights. His technique in cutting across the ball was flawless and now Norwich could sense daylight.The surprise was that Leicester, who are manifestly not the outfit that looked unstoppable during the autumn, offered so little in response. They cannot take a Champions League place for granted on this evidence and failed to carve out the chance that might further their claim, leaving Carrow Road daring to dream."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f99d8e30bb839bf03bc5a98be5e4f866e3bccc/0_34_4562_2737/master/4562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c633b0e9d05976c8bf7099cb6c02c172","title":"norwich city v leicester city premier league live","story":"That’s all from me today. Thanks for following. While we wait to hear from the managers, here’s something for Leicester fans to ponderMore here from goalscorer Lewis, who thinks Norwich can still make it. “When the season started we knew it would be a battle from the beginning but with the squad and togetherness we always thought we could push through and survive in this league.”Norwich’s flying fullbacks Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons have been revelling in their victory tonight.“I cut across it and aimed for that spot,” says Lewis of his goal, which came from an Aarons cross.“The finish wasn’t a surpise for me, he works on it every day,” adds Aarons. “This is massive for us. We will go to Sheffield United with all guns blazing.”Leicester’s poor run continues and that unexpected defeat means it’s just one win in the last seven for them in the Premier League. Their top four spot is looking more precarious by the week but they still have quite a gap to defend so I’m sure Brendan Rodgers won’t be panicking just yet.That’s Norwich’s fifth win of the season and second clean sheet at home. More importantly, it leaves them four points from safety with 10 games still to play. Not impossible with a fair wind...They couldn’t, could they? Norwich have given themselves a fighting chance of survival with a crucial win. Well done them.90min+4 Norwich have a free kick deep in the Leicester half with only a minute to play Drmic almost makes it 2-0. Time’s almost up now anyway and Carrow Road is jumping...90min+1 Five minutes added time as another cross from Chilwell goes astray. Norwich are almost home and hosed.89 min Nothing doing again as Leicester are frustrated in attack. A break from Norwich then sees Schmeichel called into action to deny Stiepermann.87 min Stiepermann enters the fray in what will be the last change of the night. He comes on for Duda, who has played well but should really have scored.85 min It’s not looking great for Leicester, who are struggling to create anything as the clock ticks down. Lots of sideways passing but no killer ball.81 min That’s enough for Pukki, who has been replaced by Josip Drmic as Norwich look to see this through.“It may not look sexy stats-wise but this has been a very watchable match between two likeable teams,” emails Speakeasy Ray seven minutes ago. “Norwich hardly look cowed and the Foxes look dangerous - that Canaries goal sets this up for a brilliant 20 minutes.”78 min Barnes smashes a wayward shot into the River Yare. They’ll need a boat for that one. On comes Marc Albrighton for Perez in a last throw of the dice for Rodgers.75 min Leicester are pushing forward and almost found a way through down the right just now after good play from Ricardo. Can Norwich stand firm for a second clean sheet of the season at home?73 min That’s Norwich’s first goal from open play for nearly 700 minutes and a first Premier League goal for Lewis. The ball came to him after a cross from Aarons from the right eluded everyone in the middle but the finish was briliant, swerving right into the corner to leave Schmeichel helpless. Meanwhile Ndidi spurns a chance to equalise almost immediately...Jamal Lewis scores from a crazy angle to give the Canaries hope. What a strike!68 min Wilfred Ndidi is on for Leicester in his first appearance since 22 January. Meanwhile a knackered Cantwell is replaced by Lukas Rupp66 min Best chance of the night so far for Norwich and Duda should really have made it 1-0 after a lovely pass from Buendia. He went for power over placement though and Schmeichel was able to make a comfortable save.65 min Barnes has been a real livewire for Leicester all night and he is the latest to test Krul but again his shot is straight at the goalkeeper. Where’s Jamie Vardy when you need him? At home nursing his calf injury probably.61 min Schmeichel produces an important reaction save to deny a fierce shot from Duda. Much better from Norwich, who haven’t had a shot on target since the ninth minute apparently. Then Praet brings down Aarons and is duly booked.57 min Kenny McLean tried his very best to take out Barnes with a cynical challenge but the winger is too quick for him! Lucky boy...55 min Perez connects well with Chilwell’s cross but the header is well off target. Just had another look at that Iheancho decision and it was incredibly harsh, with the ball just brushing his hand as it fell to his feet.53 min Grant Hanley takes one for the team to bring down a flying Harvey Barnes and is shown a yellow card for his troubles. The free kick is cleared but it’s been a strong start to this half from the visitors.51 min The decision to disallow the goal certainly hasn’t gone down well with the Leicester fans, who serenade Carrow Road with a chorus of ‘Fuck VAR’. It was harsh but them’s the rules these days49 min Iheanacho has the ball in the net but it’s been disallowed by VAR after replays showed the ball hit his arm as he was bringing it under control. A shame because it was a brilliant finish from outside the box.47 min Teemu Pukki thought he was in for a second but was correctly flagged offside. There needs to be a big half coming up for him if Norwich are to kick off their great escape.The teams are back out and it doesn’t look like there have been any changes. Let’s go!Some half-time reading if you will forgive the shameless self-promotion....Both sides had their chances but Leicester will be more disappointed not to be ahead. Now where’s Delia?45 min+2 Another foul from Maddison gives Norwich a late opportunity in stoppage time but they can’t make it count. 44 min Leicester’s latest chance from a corner falls to Evans but his header is tame and easy for Tim Krul to gather. Maddison is always such a danger from set-pieces.42 min Cantwell’s mazy run sets up Pukki for a shot at goal but the Finland striker scuffs his shot well wide. Some lovely touches again from the England Under-21 player in the buildup, he’s having a great season despite Norwich’s struggles.39 min Iheanacho wastes a brilliant opportunity to give Leicester the lead after a mistake from Jamal Lewis but the Nigerian blazes the chance over from six yards out. Replays suggested it may have been disallowed anyway by VAR but it was still a bad miss.35 min Delia Smith has just been spotted in the stands but it doesn’t look like she is in the mood for another speech. That could change if Norwich concede before half-time of course... 33 min Cantwell prevents Ricardo from whipping in another cross but concedes a corner in the process. But Soyuncu’s overhead kick is so bad it doesn’t even go for a throw-in!!30 min Ben Chilwell has been receiving treatment next to the dugouts which has allowed Brendan Rodgers to have a quick chat with Maddison and Jonny Evans. More of the same is the instruction I’d imagine. Chilwell is back on his feet again now so we’re all good.28 min Grant Hanley comes to Norwich’s rescue after great work from Ayoze Perez sees him square the ball across the box. A corner routine then almost sees Iheanacho steal in to convert a brilliant cross from Maddsion. The pressure is building.26 min Leicester hit the post! Ricardo’s cross from the right is erted onto the woodwork by Praet, much to the relief of the home supporters.24 min Some more free-flowing football from Norwich with Cantwell at the heart of it once more. But then his mistake allows Praet to break only for Iheanacho to plant his shot into the river.22 min Caglar Soyuncu is good looking enough to be a Hollywood movie star but is also pretty good at defending. He had to be at his best to block Pukki’s shot there after some nice buildup play from Norwich.19 min Nice footwork from Harvey Barnes to set up Dennis Praet for a shot outside the area but it’s straight at the keeper. This game is bubbling up nicely...14 min Maddison lucky to escape a booking after a foul on Aarons. “Next one,” says referee Craig Pawson12 min Todd Cantwell is a real talent, as shown by his burst up field just now that saw him brought down for a foul 35 yards out. Buendia shapes to take it but only finds the wall.9 min Poor defending from Ben Chilwell gives Ondrej Duda the opportunity to cross from the right after a corner and Ben Godfrey’s header is on target but straight at Schmeichel.7 min An excellent corner from Maddison picks out Hamza Choudhury totally unmarked but his header flies over the bar. A decent chance that5 min A big night for Kelechi Iheanacho, who has enjoyed something of a revival under Brendan Rodgers. He gets the better of his marker but Leicester can’t make the most of it in the end2 mins And we’re under way with Max Aarons putting in an early cross for Teemu Pukki which is easily gathered by SchmeichelThe rain is coming down hard now in Norwich as the teams emerge onto the pitch. The home manager knows they are up against it but clearly won’t be giving up before it’s all over. “It’s difficult - we’re realistic,” admits Daniel Farke. “But you have a chance in every game.”Perhaps they could do with some kryptonite at the back, suggests Richard T. W. Arthur via email“On my way to the ophthamologist’s, I notice that Norwich have Supermann on the bench,” he writes. “Surely he should be playing? They could certainly use his help.”Norwich have the fewest points at home this season in the Premier League with just 12 so it’s no surprise they are rock bottom. They have kept just one clean sheet at home this season and will be wary of the threat posed by Leicester even in Vardy’s absence.A nice interview with James Maddison, who has admitted he has been looking forward to facing his former club all season. He spent two seasons at Carrow Road after joining from Coventry in 2016 but says there will be no room for any sentimentality once the game has started.“It’ll be a nice occasion but, make no mistake, we’re here to get three points,” Maddison told Sky just now.The erudite Efan Ekoku is a pundit for Sky this evening and he has been assessing why his former side Norwich have struggled so much this season . “I’m disappointed,” said the former striker. “There have been lots of good performances but they’ve not been able to get across the finishing line enough.”By way of pure coincidence, it happens to be exactly 15 years to the night since Delia Smith’s infamous half-time teamtalk during their match against Manchester City. Here’s a reminder of her stirring words as you’ve never heard them before...So much for my bit about Vardy in the preamble then! As well as Leicester fans, I’m sure there are a few Fantasy League managers also reeling from his absence tonight. This could be a big opportunity for Norwich to get three points but then again it’s not all about Vardy with this Brendan Rodgers’ team...And there’s a boost for Norwich fans who like their playmakers with the news that Emi Buendia is back in the team having been left on the bench recently by Daniel Farke.Some early team news and it’s a big shock with Jamie Vardy not in the Leicester squad due to a reported calf injury. Kelechi Iheanacho comes in up topEvening all. Welcome to our coverage of tonight’s Premier League game between Norwich and Leicester at Carrow Road. It’s almost do-or-die for the Canaries with games quickly running out to save themselves from the drop as they prepare to welcome the high-flying Foxes to East Anglia. Seven points stand between Daniel Farke’s side and safety going into this match but you can bet their supporters will be up for a bit of Friday football under the lights, even with Storm Jorge expected to wreak havoc in the UK this weekend. Can Norwich end their five-match wait for a victory just when they need it most?Meanwhile, Leicester having been licking their wounds after the late defeat to Manchester City last week and will be keen to bounce back tonight with a victory. They still have a nine point lead over Manchester United in fifth but will know that this is a great opportunity to extend that before Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side face Everton on Sunday.The last time Jamie Vardy scored in the Premier League against city on 21 December no one had heard of coronavirus and he was five goals clear of his nearest rival in the race for the Golden Boot. Fast forward 10 weeks and Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has drawn level on 17 so it’s up to Leicester’s talisman to hit back. It could be a thriller. Join me...

Instead, it is asking them to hold their phones at arm’s length, smile and wish you a happy birthday.The concept is simple enough: you can pay a famous face – a genuine megastar such as Snoop Dogg or a cult figure from a favourite reality show – to send a message to you, or a friend, and be as surreal or personal as you want (within reason). And now that Cameo has mastered the US market, it is looking further afield.“Awareness is growing … it won’t be long before Cameo is everywhere in the UK,” says Martin Blencowe, Cameo’s co-founder, who often works (with two others) from the platform’s Soho office and signs up many stars to the platform himself.At the top of his British wishlist are Daniel Craig, Lennox Lewis, John Cleese, Jay from The Inbetweeners and David Jason of Only Fools and Horses. “If you got a message from Del Boy, everyone would want that: ‘Rodney, you plonker’, ‘This time next year we’ll be millionaires!’”It works like this: the fan chooses a celebrity from Cameo’s “marketplace” – which can be ordered by price or category, just like on Asos – then fills out a form, briefing them on what to say. Some celebrities, such as Jackass’s Bam Margera, typically respond within hours.Dick Van Dyke, the 94-year-old Mary Poppins star, says on his profile he has been unable to fulfil all orders “due to overwhelming demand”, despite charging $500 a go.Plugs for businesses typically cost more. Larry Thomas, who played the Soup Nazi on Seinfield, charges more than double his standard rate to appear wearing a chef’s coat.Any request is accepted at the talent’s discretion – though that is not always exercised. The rapper Flavor Flav was last year tricked into recording a video wishing Cardinal George Pell, convicted of child sex abuse, a “happy retirement”.Flav told media: “I just do the shoutouts … I didn’t know I was shouting out paedophiles!”For better or worse – more often better, says Blencowe – Cameo presents people with a way to connect with their favourite public figures: “We make superfans.”Among the messages that stand out in his memory are the powerlifter CT Fletcher’s pep talk for an aspiring actor and The Goonies star Sean Astin encouraging a fan to stay sober.Blencowe moved from Brighton to LA as a promising track runner 14 years ago, before his athletics career was ended by injury. He says he had the idea for Cameo in 2016 while working as an agent in the NFL.His friend had just had a child and he asked the Seattle Seahawks player Cassius Marsh to record a message of congratulations. “It was a way for me to compensate for not calling for two days,” says Blencowe, “but my buddy went nuts over it.”Since then, Cameo has raised more than $65m in funding and sold more than half a million videos, most in the last year.But another Briton has laid claim to the original idea. Angus Lancaster founded CelebVM in 2013 after he saw how difficult it was for bands to interact with their fans while working on a One Direction music video.Most of the hundreds of celebrities on his books are British, including John Challis from Only Fools and Horse, Big Keith (Ewen Macintosh) from the UK Office, Paul Cattermole from S Club 7 and stars from Towie, The Real Housewives of Cheshire and Right Said Fred. Each ask about £20-30 for a video.Lancaster says Cameo “did just copy the idea” – but its press, plus the crossover between its books, has helped CelebVM grow. “It’s only affected us beneficially, really.”Plus, adds Lancaster, both are dependent on their stars’ networks for success. “It’s not the platforms that have got the power, it’s the celebrities and their social media. We just facilitate it.”For Cameo’s bigger stars, it is an easy way to monetise what they are often asked to do for free, and on their terms. “They can pick and choose when they work – it’s almost like the gig economy for celebrities,” says Will Hobson of the Sheffield-based digital marketing agency Rise at Seven.Depending on demand, it is possible for them to earn sums in the “mid-six figures” annually from Cameo, says Blencowe – including on commission, by signing up their famous friends.Iain McCallum, a communications consultant with 30 years’ experience of television, says it is “inevitable” that Cameo will grow in the UK – but added that brand-savvy stars with careers that sustain them would probably avoid it.His advice to his own clients would be to “think very carefully about the profile that you’ve worked so hard to build”.But, adds McCallum, “I would never say to anybody that they are wrong to do it … It’s tough out there.” For those who have been “bitten by the TV bug” but are struggling to stay afloat in the industry, Cameo is a viable source of income.At least one name on Blencowe’s list may elude him. David Jason’s manager said she could not say whether Jason would ever join Cameo – but he would “certainly” never appear as Del Boy. “He is part of David’s past.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4bd00e6f23c608a13adc80eb20458d11dfdfb8/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c80489b8bb98d3e403b40b4db49663","title":"i want to know who my father was should i take dna test","story":"Be aware that there are two types of DNA test, and prepare yourself for answers you aren’t expecting, says Annalisa BarbieriI am 60, and have known for years that my father was not my real father. My mother once explained that when I was conceived my father was away, so it couldn’t have been him. She had an affair with a man she won’t tell me about also, at the time was raped by my father’s brother. I share many physical traits with my sisters, so have always assumed my uncle was my real father. My father died 25 years ago, followed by my uncle 10 years later, so I cannot get DNA samples.It has never bothered me in the past, but, strangely, as my children and I get older, I want to know who my father was. There are so many DNA-testing kits and websites that I don’t know where to start. That’s a lot of information for you to process: that your father wasn’t your father that your mother was raped by her brother-in-law that she had an affair with an unnamed man. You didn’t mention whether your mother is still alive. If she is, I wonder if you could safely rekindle the conversation about your real father with her?As for the practicalities of DNA testing, I’ve had many letters in the past six months asking about this. Be aware that there are two types of tests: one to see if you are related (or not) to someone and “ancestry” tests, which shed light on your ethnicitygenealogy. The two aren’t the same.I contacted two professionals in this field. One, Penny Scott, is a partner at Cartridges Law, chair of the Family Law Committee of the Law Society and a member of its children panel the other was Ryan Wetherell, operations manager at NorthGene Ltd, a government-accredited DNA-testing laboratory.If you want to go down the DNA-testing route, from what you’ve told me, your best bet would be to ask your sisters to provide a sample. To do this, you must have their written consent. To take “bodily material” from someone (a hair from their hairbrush, say, or send in their toothbrush) without their consent would contravene the Human Tissue Act 2004, which covers DNA testing, and therefore would be a criminal offence.Within DNA testing to see if you arearen’t related to someone there are two types: one to find out who your relations arearen’t for your own interest, and one for legal purposes (for changing a birth certificate, say, or to get someone to pay child maintenance). With the former, as long as all written permissions are obtained, you can collect the samples and deal with the labs directly. The latter is more expensive because a chain of custody has to be maintained – so the DNA sample (usually a swab from the mouth) would have to be taken by an independent third person: a GP, pharmacist, or nurse or the DNA agency may have a collector who can do this. This ensures the sample is taken from the right person and not tampered with. If you were able to get bodily material – from clothing or razors, say – from someone who is deceased, written consent must be given by the next of kin. It’s important to make this clear as there is a lot of misinformation about DNA tests.Now to the emotional aspect. I feel you may need to prepare yourself for answers you aren’t expecting. What if none of your siblings share a father? What if you all do? What if only two of you do? What answer are you hoping to get? What if this test raises more questions than it answers? If your mother is alive, will you discuss the results with her? I do wonder why your mother told you what she did without offering you any resolution.Whatever you do, I urge you to make sure you have someone to talk to: a trusted friend, a counsellor attached to your GP’s surgery, or visit the links below.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Thomas’s talks (I found them on YouTube) are shouty, inspirational monologues in which he berates people for not wanting success enough: they think they want it, but they need to want it the way they want to breathe. And I do find them quite motivating, once you get past the fact that this logic completely ignores social circumstance as the primary driver of success.One of the things that Thomas asserts is that he wakes up at 3am. This enables him to get loads of stuff done while everyone else is asleep, and so stay ahead of the competition. He says cool-sounding things like, “I use pain to push me to greatness”, and “I do not take constructive criticism from people who have never constructed anything”, which implies you should only take advice from builders.I found myself reflecting on his early starts as I shafted my own sleep patterns beyond all recognition. Right now, I am typing this while my family are sleeping soundly – because if I think about something I have to do, I cannot relax until it is done. Thomas would be proud.Lately I have been trying to fit exercise into my life while also staying on top of work, which has led to some early starts. January saw me getting up at 5am to head to the gym, where I would push it to the max, then feel terrible for the rest of the day. In my defence, I wanted to be back in time for the school run, and you don’t get a body like mine without effort. As the old saying goes, “No pain, no gelatinous body that makes you sad when you go on holiday”.The problem is, my job involves late nights, and I often don’t get to sleep until 2am. In the past, I have simply cancelled my early morning and slept in, waking up later to lament my failure to “chase the tiger” or whatever Thomas might say. This year, I didn’t want to do that, but am instead left absolutely useless for the rest of the day. Last week I went to a launch event, where I was meant to talk to people enthusiastically about my upcoming shows, and ended up spending the evening reassuring them that I was actually OK, because I looked so glassy-eyed and exhausted.Paranoia is another side effect of my short nights. Sleep deprivation makes perspective a long-forgotten friend, my days spent mentally spiralling off the smallest thing. I did an advert for my podcast recently that went to the sponsor with some incorrect wording, which meant that my eye for detail has gone, which meant that my work would start to get worse, which meant that my agent would drop me, which meant I would struggle to pay the bills, which meant my family would leave me. Thomas would say, “A setback is only a setup for a comeback” but I don’t think by “comeback” he means “correctly worded advert”.A couple of weeks ago, I did a charity club night that went on until 3am. I then had to get home in time to travel to the airport for 6am, albeit for a family half-term break. After weeks of early starts and late nights, this sent me into a kind of madness. I am sure my kids were just playfully bantering in the departure lounge, but to me it sounded as if they were saying, “Hey, Daddy, all three of us are going to spend the day trying to make you cry.” The second we got on the plane and settled the kids, I fell asleep. I woke up feeling properly rested, for the first time in ages. I looked across to tell my wife so, before realising that she’d had to look after the kids on her own while I slept. She looked the way I did at the launch event. I told her the reason she didn’t feel good is because she didn’t want it enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0b8fed51223acfb07870aba47a165441730f886/0_271_4191_2516/master/4191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9babebe5a47cdc5c93a0b281a1fdbac4","title":"lets move to masham north yorkshire","story":"The keeping of one and brewing of the other have long gone hand in hand in this beautiful market townWhat’s going for it?

It expects sales to improve during 2020.Nationwide’s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said the housing market had gained momentum in recent months. “While overall economic growth ground to a halt in the final three months of 2019, labour market conditions remained buoyant and borrowing costs low. The decisive election outcome may have provided a boost to buyer sentiment,” he said.However, the outlook for house prices will depend on the UK’s economic performance over the coming months, which could take a hit depending on the outcome of Brexit trade talks and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. “There are still significant uncertainties that threaten to exert a drag on the economy in the coming quarters,” Gardner warned. Nevertheless, Nationwide expects the UK economy to continue expanding at a modest pace, with house prices staying broadly flat. If the forecast proves correct, the fortunes of estate agents could improve.The chief executive, Nic Budden, said Foxtons sales pipeline – transactions not yet completed – was stronger than a year earlier. “Looking forward, with the uncertainty of the general election removed, early signs are that the sales market may improve,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05ddde41f2bdf5e7ae565d34afd98aea60e827f/382_567_2386_1432/master/2386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6754b259a8b9650e8b75077ca7ef5ea","title":"why young pop stars are suddenly playing arenas lewis capaldi","story":"Musicians used to start out playing pubs – now the likes of Lewis Capaldi are booking arenas before their debut album. Is this sudden success damaging long-term careers?Picking up an honour earlier this month at LA’s Pollstar awards, which celebrate achievements in live music, Elton John delivered some advice. “To people who manage people who are young: don’t put them in big arenas too soon, make it interesting. If I was Lewis Capaldi’s manager, I wouldn’t put him into Madison Square Garden. I’d say, we’ll play two nights at Radio City. Let him have the demand … You build up a career.”But Capaldi, the Grammy-nominated Scottish singer who had 2019’s biggest-selling album in the UK and a No 1 single in the US, is already at arena level – his 2020 tour, beginning next week, will see him play some of the UK’s biggest venues, including two nights at London’s Wembley Arena. He is one of a few artists playing giant rooms after just one album: Sam Fender and Dermot Kennedy will soon play two shows each at Alexandra Palace, and Billie Eilish plays four O2 Arena dates in July. Scottish troubadour Gerry Cinnamon is set to play arenas, castles, parks and even Glasgow’s Hampden Park stadium. Selling that many tickets on a debut album campaign contrasts with the slow-and-steady strategy that worked for Elton John and many more of the world’s biggest acts. Even Adele didn’t play the O2 Arena until releasing her third album, and Ed Sheeran visited on his second.So why is it happening? Adele and Mabel’s agent Lucy Dickins, who heads up the UK music ision of super-agency WME, says that social media is a big influence. “Some artists have huge followings without having to play small shows. This often means they haven’t had the time to work on their live show and develop as artists used to.”The unfettered availability of music via streaming also plays a role, according to music promoter Steve Homer, co-CEO of AEG Presents. As a result, “there are so many artists who can sell large numbers of tickets. The way that people now show their love of an artist is going to see them live.”Jack Garratt was playing to almost 10,000 people across two nights at the Eventim Apollo in London shortly after releasing his debut album and winning the critics’ choice award at the 2016 Brits. As he recently told the BBC, the pressure and expectation that came with his fast rise led to a three-year period of self-doubt. He is now playing smaller venues before releasing his second album. Acts such as Years \u0026amp Years, Tom Odell and John Newman have also experienced up-and-downs in venue size and ticket sales after reaching a wide audience with their first albums.Which isn’t generally considered good, as ATC Live booking agent Alex Bruford, who works with acts including Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, nomy and Shame, explains. “You don’t want to be in a position where, within 18 months, you’ve sold 10,000 tickets then on the next tour you’ve sold 5,000. The festivals and labels, and people around you, will start thinking that you’re on the way down.” There’s also the potential of a big show falling flat – while Capaldi sold out his arena tour in 10 minutes (and added a second London date), other artists haven’t had as much luck. Lorde was playing to arenas that were a third full in 2018, and some reviews for the Weeknd’s O2 Arena shows in 2013 and 2017 mentioned a lack of variety and a “rough” and “unpolished” live show.Suddenly going from the pub and club circuit to playing in front of large crowds during a busy worldwide tour can contribute to health problems. Capaldi, Fender and Kennedy have cancelled tour dates due to vocal issues, and psychotherapist Tamsin Embleton, who specialises in working with musicians, says she’s seen “many artists whose bodies are displaying the signs of chronic stress or who have burnt out due to excessive intensive touring”.Nina Nesbitt was 17 when, in the space of six months, she went from playing pubs in Edinburgh to supporting Example on an arena tour. “I’d played about 10 gigs in pubs and suddenly I was on stage in front of 3,000 people – it was terrifying,” she says. “I was also super-grateful, because it’s amazing to be given those opportunities. I didn’t want to let my anxiety get in the way, but I’d get so nervous, feel sick and dizzy on stage and leave a song early.” She says her experience is a “very common thing for most musicians – you really have to play loads of gigs to get to a level where you’re comfortable. Something that I was told at the time was you’ve got to ride momentum and hype because it’s not something that can necessarily be created. So I felt a lot of pressure to go with it and do a bit of a crash course.”With the UK music industry eager to produce more Capaldis, it is worth closely examining how these artists are being nurtured. Bruford concludes: “I think we are in a very healthy phase in the live industry at the moment. It’s just that we have to give artists a chance to develop before their audiences without trying to milk them too fast. Young artists need to be given a chance to grow.” As it stands, too many are burning out, or fading away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1ec1128726d2d34bb843a847b8fc1dfd1119b6/0_0_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890db3037312446cdfc218cf71959a54","title":"i bet bon scott is pissing himself the acdc covers gig shutting down a major perth highway","story":"The Highway to Hell convoy will close Perth’s arts festival – and its roads – with semi-trailers topped by bands blasting Ackadacka songs It may be a celebration of a uniquely Western Australian cult figure, but Highway To Hell – the Perth International Arts Festival’s closing gambit for 2020, which will see 10km of Perth’s Canning Highway closed this Sunday for a moving ACDC covers concert – has attracted interest from bands all over the world.“You can’t find anyone in the world, let alone Australia, who doesn’t know what ACDC means,” says organiser Pete Stone of the event, which will feature eight slow-moving trucks topped with bands including Amyl and the Sniffers, Odette Mercy and Pigram Brothers. End of Fashion, Mojo Juju and the Jam Tarts will be playing at stages set up in along the way.“We’ve had bands ringing us from the Canary Islands to Japan to California, you name it, prepared to fly themselves here to be a part of it. ACDC’s reach is actually phenomenal they discovered this formula early on and they just stayed true to it. I think there’s something about that that resonates with people, it’s like a constant known in your life.”Bon Scott occupies a unique place in the popular culture psyche, betwixt and beyond that of even ACDC’s global fame the pub laureate – the lascivious, loquacious ratbag with a sensitive side – seems to speak to the battler in all of us. The event will run along a stretch of highway between the Fremantle home of his youth and the watering hole he frequented: the Raffles hotel. The event marks 40 years – to the day – since Bon Scott’s ashes were buried at Fremantle Cemetery Metallica, Soundgarden and the Cult are among the luminaries who have visited the grave since.The event is a logistical feat which will close not just the long stretch of a major city artery – two lanes for the trucks, the other two for the public – but the 120 side streets leading into it. While some may see it as a Bogan Barbecue, it would seem more fitting to call it a Fanfare For the Common Man.The concept was hatched in late 2018 by newly minted artistic director Iain Grandage. Consultations involved three councils – Melville, Fremantle and East Fremantle – plus the state government and its relevant departments, Main Roads, Perth Transit Authority and the Western Australian Police. According to Stone, it was never a case of “why do it?” but “how it could be done”.Stone says all concerned parties have “bent over backwards” amid the many approvals required to get this event – moving trucks and all – rolling down the road.“If people think that local government has a reputation for not being flexible or quick to respond then this experience certainly shatters that view,” he notes. “They’ve all managed to see the big picture very clearly.”“The Bon Scott story is a local story,” Stone adds. “It’s a Western Australian story which is a beautiful thing and a good connection with the community. The other thing is the reclamation of the highway for the day – there’s a whole lot of layers to it and that resonates as strongly with people as any element of the event.”Southern River Band are one of the truck-bound musicians who will be playing. “Bon Scott is freedom, an outlaw holding a microphone in place of a gun, in a world none too welcoming,” frontman Callum Kramer says. “If there’s gonna be something to shut half the highway down for, I can’t think of anything better than ACDC.”End Of Fashion’s Justin Burford feels the same way. “Bon Scott is as Aussie as meat pies and as West Aussie as bad merging. We’re proud to be a part of any event that has the potential for wreaking havoc and chaos on this scale, and I bet Bon is pissing himself laughing at the whole thing from wherever he is now.”• Highway To Hell closes down Perth’s Canning Highway on Sunday 1 March from 3pm.

That makes sense given the complexity of many transactions. Worth noting, that is with skilled, trained, experienced labour.“So if we are dealing with 200m extra declarations, at a productivity rate of 4,000 per year that equals 50,000 staff needed on day one, and probably more.” Gove has access to about £7.5m to fund new HRMC customs agents but may seek funds from the wider Border Delivery Group cross-department initiative to prepare for 1 January 2021.Neighbouring countries including France, the Netherlands and Ireland launched customs officials recruitment drives last year, with six-month training schedules considered a minimum.Agents in Dover who deal with lorries coming in from the Ukraine, Turkey and other non-EU countries have warned that the skills base around customs disappeared with the creation of the single market in 1991, with just a handful of customs agents now operating in offices in Dover.The emergence of the human resource needed puts into perspective the scale of the task – the number of staff needed dwarfs the 12,000 people estimated to work in the fishing industry, a sector emblematic of Brexit.Government sources have said the new recruits would largely be “intermediaries”, agents who help businesses process their export and import paperwork with HMRC.The tax authorities will also recruit government agents to process the paperwork and guard against tariff evasion on borders.The Freight Transport Association and the RHA have been pressing the government for the past three years to wake up to the realities of a hard Brexit.The FTA said Thursday’s publication of the government’s negotiating goals gave some “hope” in that it provided confirmation that the government was not pursuing frictionless trade.However, it called for “more ambition” to help road, aviation and rail transport prepare to minimise the disruption from 1 January.“Over recent months, the FTA has repeatedly requested the UK government prioritise the needs of logistics in its negotiations around the future trading relationship with the EU or risk a devastating effect on the UK’s highly interconnected supply chain. The business organisation has also warned of knock-on effects on UK plc’s future productivity, and on the economy as a whole but these concerns seem to have been overlooked,” it said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.A British man who was quarantined on Diamond Princess cruise ship has died, Japanese media reports.

The furore sparked by the recent decision to cut funding for the Championship has revealed a fault line running throughout rugby union in England. It might best be termed as the tension between recreation and ambition, community and elitism, the amateur ethos and the professional.The question has never quite been resolved since professionalism. What is the purpose of the clubs beneath the elite? What is the purpose of the sprawling, seamless pyramid of leagues in which they play? There are those at the heart of it now proclaiming the future death of grassroots rugby, a slow strangling of the community game.The RFU is midway through its latest review to try to settle on a system that might better cater for the needs of more than 1,500 rugby clubs among its membership. The adult male future competitions survey on the RFU website will continue to accept submissions until it closes next Friday. Clubs are urged to have their say.Unanimity of opinion is not expected. “The great thing about our game,” says Steve Grainger, the RFU’s rugby development director, “is there’s so much ersity of thinking. The biggest challenge in our game is there’s so much ersity of thinking.”This chimes with the results from a survey of more than 350 clubs from across all the regions and levels of rugby in England for my recently published book on rugby in the 21st century, Unholy Union: When Rugby Collided with the Modern World. In the hundreds of supplementary comments, the refrain that a ring-fencing of the elite game would be the death of their club was common, but not as common as the lament that the league system itself was killing the community game.The insidious effect of the seamless structure is to institutionalise the idea of ambition, the notion that anyone can make it to the top. The effect of the professional era has been to normalise the idea of paying players to pimp up your first team. In the Unholy Union survey there were reports of payments to players as low as level nine. One club in level 12, the lowest rung of the current system, said it pays expenses for its first XV. Four clubs across levels seven, eight and nine said they harbour ambitions to reach the Premiership.All of which introduces an element of toxicity into the structure. It takes only one or two teams in a region or league to start paying players to make others feel the pressure to respond, just so they can hang on to their own or maintain their position. Across any few years of the professional era, one can chart the rise, and usually fall, of ‘ambitious’ clubs through the league structure. These shooting stars are invariably fuelled not by a golden generation of local talent but by the money of wealthy iniduals, which in turn prioritises investment in the first XV, the standard by which so many clubs seem to judge themselves.“If I walk into a club and ask how things are going,” says Grainger, “the answer is always about the first XV. What you want to hear is how a club fielded four teams for the first time or developed a second women’s team, age group and minis. It’s that holistic view.”Taken with developments in the wider world, the prioritising of the first XV has had a withering effect on the community game since the leagues were introduced in 1987, quite alarmingly so if the measure is fixtures played. The last time the RFU conducted a review of the league structures, in 2014, they pulled out the examples of two clubs, Morpeth and Harrow. In the 1982-3 season, each played more than 180 fixtures across six XVs 40 years later Morpeth played 86 across four and Harrow 56 across two.Suffering injuries and the fear of injury are two of the three most cited reasons for players dropping out of rugby. The other is travel. In a culture of changing work patterns, more enlightened approaches to parenting and an increased accent on inidualism, the traditional model of the rugby club has been transformed, as has each player’s commitment to it.Level four club\u0026nbspIf the Premiership is ringfenced expect an exodus of financial backers from the lower league clubs and the eventual demise of grassroots rugbyLevel four club Soon we will only have the larger clubs, less rugby being played below first-team level and too much there.

That might not be a\u0026nbspbad\u0026nbspthingLevel 10 club Bigger clubs in our area get bigger,\u0026nbspwhile smaller clubs are strugglingRugby, at all levels, is an increasingly punishing game. The only other team sport in the world that might be further along the collision spectrum is American football. It is telling that no one has even tried to establish an adult community game there. The model works. The NFL is the biggest spectator sport in the world by average attendance and needs only a supply line of youth to keep it viable, players dropping out of the system as they grow older, until only the elite continue into adulthood. There is a fear that this is the future towards which rugby is heading.The current review of the league structure is not the first. From 2012 to 2014, the RFU canvassed the views of players around the country and devised a new structure designed to reduce the number of league games and the amount of travel. The uproar among, tellingly, the administrators of various clubs was loud and decisive, citing the loss of home fixtures and an expected dilution in playing standards. It is not only at elite level that the imperatives of player welfare and revenue generation war with each other.The Northern Action Group was formed, through which a collection of clubs in the north threatened to break away if the restructure went ahead. With a World Cup to host on the horizon, the RFU agreed to shelve it rather than risk mutiny. Ironically, within two years, another group of clubs from Lancashire broke away from the league system to form two isions of a mini-league of their own, citing the burden of excessive travel.Reports of their new arrangement are encouraging, but even that has come at a cost. Those left languishing in the farther reaches of Cumbria seethe at the consequent reduction in their fixtures and the dilution of playing standards. These are issues facing any league system, but this time the hope is for a more open mind among the RFU’s membership to the concept of a restructure.If ring-fencing the elite game, whether at Premiership level or Championship level or both, ever comes to pass, it is likely to be independent of the current review. Which is not to say the RFU would be against it. Many clubs struggling at adult level are now sustained by the vibrancy of their minis sections, which have boomed since the 1990s, but rugby’s current great growth area is the women’s game. The Tyrrell’s Premier 15s is an example of just such a set-up, with membership of the elite established by application, not by results on the field.“We’re just at the beginning with the women’s game,” says Grainger, “but that gives us a good opportunity not to go down the same path as the men’s. I won’t say make the same mistakes! We want a community that is flourishing through rugby, where rugby is flourishing through the community. What does that look like? Don’t know yet. We’re at a watershed.”In an undoubtedly challenging environment, beset by social pressures way beyond its control, community rugby needs to decide what it wants to be. That means inidual clubs deciding. The wise ones will focus on the joy of playing and their status as community centres. The wise clubs will leave ambition to the elite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57611927ba482e7106007b3c6ec03d55e0089d2c/0_150_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c014367302550ba0943fa0d7c46af6d3","title":"sun yang benefited from convenient friendship with swimmings chiefs","story":"In the Sun Yang case the only thing clear about the way Fina runs swimming is the water in the poolIn August 2016, two years after Sun Yang was banned for three months because he’d been caught using an illegal stimulant, he won the Olympic 200m freestyle. It was his third gold medal, after his victories in the 400m and 1500m at London 2012. Sun explained the drug was medication for a heart problem. Still, it’s fair to say that some people there weren’t too happy about it. Australian freestyler Mack Horton called him a “drugs cheat”, French backstroker Camille Lacourt said he “pisses purple”. Others, though, seemed to be genuinely pleased for him. Particularly Cornel Marculescu, the executive director of Fina, the international swimming federation, who gave Sun a long hug after he stepped off the podium.Afterwards, Sun explained that Marculescu had been “like a grandfather” to him. “He is a very good friend of the Chinese swim team,” he said. “So I was very happy to see him see me win the gold. I hope this friendship will last.” It did. A year later, Fina made a special point of celebrating “this friendship” at its World Aquatics Gala in the Chinese city of Sanya, when it presented Sun with a bespoke award for “Outstanding Contribution to Swimming Popularity in China”. Asked about it afterwards, a Fina spokesman told Inside the Games the award had been made at “the request of the China Swimming Association”.You don’t need goggles to see to the bottom of this relationship. At that same gala Fina’s president, Julio Maglione, spoke about how “China is surely a very valuable partner for Fina”. He was especially keen to stress the commercial benefits of the relationship. “The Chinese market is a very vibrant one,” he said. “This represents countless business opportunities for Western brands.” China, Maglione added, is “one of the most committed countries in the promotion of aquatics. And the results are quite fruitful: Chinese athletes are shining at the highest level at Fina competitions.” None brighter than Sun.In the world of swimming, everyone knows how Maglione and Marculescu run the sport. Maglione, 84, has been president for 10 years, Marculescu, 78, has been executive director for 34. Between them, they’ve weathered a series of scandals. The Sun Yang case is the biggest yet.The question facing them now is whether “this friendship” had any bearing on the way Fina has behaved since the Sunday Times broke the story that Sun had missed an out-of-competition drugs test in 2018 because he had got into a row with the team who had come to do the testing. The argument ended with one of Sun’s entourage smashing the vials containing his blood samples. Fina’s doping panel held an inquiry, which found the officials doing the testing hadn’t followed the correct protocols, so the samples weren’t valid. Which meant that whatever else he’d taken a hammer to, Sun hadn’t broken any rules.Last July, Sun won two more gold medals at the world championship in Gwangju. Horton refused to share a podium with him, so did Scottish freestyler Duncan Scott. Sun blew up. “You’re a loser,” he told Scott as they walked off. “I’m a winner.” In private, Fina warned all three about their conduct, but in public Marculescu singled out Horton and Scott. “It’s unfortunate,” he said, of two men who were protesting their right to compete in a clean sport. “We regret they put the sport in disrepute.” Soon after, Fina rushed through new rules compelling all medal winners to stand on the podium and banning them from making “political statements”.Meanwhile, the World Anti-Doping Agency launched an appeal against the Fina decision at the court of arbitration for sport. And it has now come to a very different conclusion to the one Fina reached. It has ruled that the doping officials had followed protocol, so Sun was guilty of tampering with his samples. The key point in the Cas ruling is this: “It is one thing to question the accreditation of the testing personnel while keeping the intact samples in the possession of the testing authorities it is quite another thing, after lengthy exchanges and warnings as to the consequences, to act in such a way that results in destroying the sample containers, thereby eliminating any chance of testing the sample at a later stage.”You might have expected Fina to remain studiously neutral in all this. But it recently emerged that behind the scenes it had supported an effort made in the Swiss courts to stop Wada’s lead prosecutor, Richard Young, from participating in the Cas hearing. Young had previously served on Fina’s legal commission but stood down to work for Wada on this case. Still, Sun’s lawyers, with Fina’s help, tried to force him to stand down because of a possible conflict of interest. They failed. Fina also sided with Sun’s legal team in a second complaint against Wada’s appeal hearing, when they raised a plea of inadmissibility because of the alleged late filing of Wada’s brief.It’s not clear how Fina’s doping panel and Cas could draw two such distinct verdicts from the one set of facts about what Sun did that night. It’s not clear why Fina decided to involve itself in Sun’s defence. It’s not clear why it cooperated in two attempts to hinder Wada’s appeal against their verdict. Right now, about the only thing that is clear about the way Fina runs this sport is the water in the pool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5427779c6353bdb919c99bf858157ca3897420ee/0_160_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=664e1ee5b5244a9278148536d65057da","title":"the cherry orchard review black box galway","story":"Black Box, GalwayContemporary themes resonate throughout Garry Hynes’s production about a debt-ridden aristocratic family on the brink of losing their estateSomething in the sombre mood of Druid Theatre Company’s production of Anton Chekhov’s last play seems attuned to current environmental and political preoccupations. From the importance of planting trees rather than chopping them down, to the urgent need for housing in Ireland, contemporary themes resonate deliberately throughout Garry Hynes’s production, without being hammered home. Her direction respects Chekhov’s own reluctance to be didactic about the debt-ridden aristocratic family of Madame Ranevskaya (Derbhle Crotty), on the brink of losing their rural Russian estate as the old order crumbles.In a colloquial, at times almost blunt, adaptation by the late Irish playwright Tom Murphy the dialogue has extra pungency, with the land developer Lopakhin (Aaron Monaghan) referring to himself as “a pig’s snout in a pastry shop”.Reminding Ranevskaya and her brother Gayev (Rory Nolan) that the auction of their family home is looming, this son of a serf is rueful rather than grasping. He is incredulous that they wilfully ignore his advice to sell their beloved estate and cherry orchard to build holiday homes. His characterisation here, along with Nolan’s endearingly bumbling Gayev, is generous, even compassionate. Likewise, Ranevskaya is sympathetically portrayed by Crotty as a woman on the run from past grief and present pain having lost her husband who “died of champagne”, and her young son, she is trapped in an abusive relationship.Francis O’Connor’s vast set with high ceilings forms a series of elegant vistas, with a proscenium stage-within-a-stage created by a framed red velvet curtain. What’s gained in stateliness is lost a little in intimacy, while the slow pace of the opening act adds to an initial distancing effect. Act three’s party scene is where it all fizzes: in a summer night’s revel, the marvellous ensemble of 19 actors whirl across the stage in a scene of abandon that is as much Murphy as Chekhov. Crotty’s Ranevskaya is at her most magnetic too, spinning on her heels with zealous student Peter (Marty Rea), who can’t wait for the “higher truth” to come. Later she clings to Gayev, the two of them like lost children, bewildered and scared, as everything changes around them.• At Black Box, Galway, until 7 March.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f498fda39ba0ca42dacc900f71be8882355732b/0_101_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a68f9db869c867d1021f0d81ac1e3e10","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez ted cruz coronavirus","story":"The Texas senator tried to pick a fight after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called out Mike Pence’s coronavirus credentialsIf you were in search of a scientifically minded, steadying presence to guide the country through the potential fallout of the coronavirus, you could not do much worse than Vice-President Mike Pence. This being the Donald Trump administration, however, where qualifications and expertise are often seen as prohibitive factors for top jobs, that’s exactly who we’ve been given.Cutting to the heart of the matter with her characteristic bluntness, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez this week pointed out the absurdity of placing Pence in charge of a potentially looming health crisis.“Mike Pence literally does not believe in science,” she tweeted on Wednesday. “It is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic. This decision could cost people their lives. Pence’s past decisions already have,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez reminded people of Pence’s credentials for the job. While he was governor of Indiana, he oversaw an HIV crisis that was so severe that at its peak, 20 new cases of HIV were diagnosed every week.“As governor, Pence’s science denial contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in Indiana’s history,” she continued. “He is not a medical doctor. He is not a health expert. He is not qualified nor positioned in any way to protect our public health.”Rushing to the defense of the administration the next day, Ted Cruz jumped into the fray.“As you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome?” Cruz responded on Twitter. “And at what age of gestation does science tell us that an unborn child feels physical pain?”He may have picked the wrong opponent – Ocasio-Cortez, it transpires, holds an award for microbiology from MIT.Despite reports in the past of the two lawmakers, surprisingly, finding common ground on other issues, Ocasio-Cortez did not let the slight go unaddressed this morning. Touting her scientific background bona fides, and jabbing at Cruz, who, like Pence, gives primacy to his religious beliefs over science, she delivered an acerbic put-down.“I’m surprised you’re asking about chromosomes given that you don’t believe in evolution,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41343817522d9d4c16f49597b3cc1c3dbd94a0f5/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38c747c32397b7492ac7974edf94bbc2","title":"joe biden south carolina primary","story":"The former vice-president looks to be in the driver’s seat as the first state in the deep south casts its voteJoe Biden is heading into South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary vote on Saturday as the heavy favourite to win, which would provide a much-needed boost just days ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday elections.There was a point in the last few weeks when it seemed like the former vice-president’s South Carolina “firewall” might actually have some cracks in it. It seemed that the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Biden’s ideological polar opposite, might prevent him from winning the state decisively.That moment came and went.“I’ve been confident about South Carolina because I’ve worked so hard over 30 or more years here … not to run for president, but to have the relationship with the community,” Biden told CNN on Friday morning. “I believe it’ll be the launching pad for me.”Biden has campaigned on a message of dignity and unity, and stressed his experience as Barack Obama’s vice-president. He was the envy of other 2020 Democratic candidates this week, after he was endorsed by Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress.“Since Congressman Clyburn has endorsed the vice-president that has given him a great boost, a great energy. That has certainly provided clarity to iniduals that were undecided,” said Clay Middleton, a South Carolina Democratic national committee member.A day later, a new Monmouth University poll of South Carolina voters found Biden leading over Sanders by 20 percentage points. That poll was notably different from other recent South Carolina polls which showed Biden leading by single digits.A solid win would give his campaign a shot in the arm days ahead of the Super Tuesday elections, when Democratic voters in 16 states and US territories will have their say on which presidential candidate they want to see take on Donald Trump in the November election.Eight major Democratic candidates including Biden and Sanders remain in contention, and this week could mark a decisive make-or-break moment for several of them.Biden entered the presidential race as the frontrunner and heavy favorite to win the Democratic nomination, but has since struggled to meet expectations. He placed a distant fourth in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, the first vote in the race in February. He didn’t do much better in New Hampshire.Biden, a more moderate Democrat called out the progressive candidate directly at a campaign stop in McClellanville on Thursday, warning that Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal “will be a long, long expensive slog, cost over $35tn and the patients can’t afford to wait”.Sanders’ signature policy Medicare for All, which would implement a government-run healthcare system in the US, is one of the most contentious policies being debated among Democrats this year, highlighting splits between progressives and moderates who largely favor an expansion of Obamacare.Biden and his team have long argued that a win in South Carolina would rebuff his critics, and show he has the ability to attract a broad coalition of Democratic voters.“The people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties,” Biden said during the latest Democratic  debate in Charleston. “I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African American vote here in South Carolina.”Mike McCauley, a veteran Democratic strategist based in South Carolina, said winning South Carolina could help Biden frame himself as the most prominent alternative to Sanders.“For moderate Democrats like myself and my colleagues and peers across South Carolina we’re looking for who’s going to be the alternative to Bernie that’s going to emerge,” he said. “So I think that’s the springboard that South Carolina can give Biden is to provide that distance.”While Sanders has risen to national frontrunner and become the candidate to beat, in South Carolina, where Biden leads in polling, the billionaire Democratic candidate Tom Steyer has also been a source of concern for the former vice-president.Steyer has poured $20m into his campaign in the state and made a concerted effort to win African American voters. He has made a point of highlighting his positions on reparations and racial justice as he has campaigned throughout the state.At a stop at a community resource center of North Charleston, Steyer said: “I really care about racial justice.”“I think when I come to South Carolina and talk to African Americans they realize I’m not kidding,” Steyer told the . “I’m serious about it and I think as a result we share some goals and we share some history and I’m talking about things that they can believe in, because I’m serious about it.”There is still a long way to go in the Democratic primary race before a presidential nominee is officially named at the party’s national convention in July.

Who’s up and who’s down this week in US politics?The leftwing senator from Vermont’s landslide victory in Nevada forced Democratic and media doubters to admit he was now the man to beat (even the day before the New York Times was still calling him the “nominal” frontrunner). But heavy lies the crown – with his new status came the avalanche of attacks from opponents that Sanders sceptics have long warned the self-proclaimed democratic socialist would face if he ever began to lead the pack.His “honeymoon” to Moscow, unwise articles he wrote for an underground zine in the 60s and 70s about cancer, orgasms and rape fantasies … Indeed, Sanders fanned the flames himself this week with typically unapologetic comments about Fidel Castro, telling CBS News he was “opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba” but adding: “He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?” There will be much more of this if Sanders’ success continues with a strong showing in South Carolina tomorrow and victory on Super Tuesday, 3 March.Whisper it, but is Biden back? Democratic centrists will eventually have to coalesce around someone to take on Sanders, and after flirting with Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, they may end up concluding that the former vice-president – for all his faults – looks the strongest. He was more focused and aggressive at the debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, and employed some amusing self-deprecation at one point when he gave way to the moderator: “Why am I stopping? No one else stops. It’s my Catholic school training.” Relying on his firewall of African American support, Biden has solidified his lead in South Carolina and can reasonably hope for a strong victory there on Saturday that might reboot his campaign. He can expect to scoop up a fair number of delegates on Super Tuesday too, particularly in Texas and North Carolina, although Sanders is increasingly leaving him for dust in California. Can he stage a comeback? Cutting out the questionable stories about being arrested in South Africa might help.Bloomberg had a better debate this week, but his social media tactics came under fire after his team posted a controversial set of satirical tweets featuring false comments supposedly made by Sanders about various dictators. It wasn’t his first offence – many objected to the misleadingly edited video his team had put out after the debate in Nevada – and the Sanders tweets were deleted. “It’s the embracing of a cynical outlook: ‘Lol nothing matters’,” Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University told the . “It’s leaning into nihilism.” Bloomberg’s national poll ratings have flatlined since his disastrous first debate performance – he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders – and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper.That last element seemed key – an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump’s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put the vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its worst ever daily drop and the S\u0026ampP 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011.Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the vice-president’s new job that there was even speculation Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket – perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley.Not to worry, though, Pence is “really very expert at the field” of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday.So expert that he notoriously wrote on his website in 2000: “Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill.” And as governor of the midwestern state of Indiana, he faced heavy criticism for his handling of the situation when the state experienced the worst HIV crisis in its history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8476018b5f0cd0e4fadb4ed36c3f687f1c542d46/0_443_5291_3174/master/5291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d9c82314e9888c2b669045911db4f68","title":"an epidemic is coming europe struggles to contain coronavirus","story":"In week in which Covid-19 jumped fence into Europe, serious questions emerge over continent’s preparednessA Spanish football journalist.

What links them is that they contracted the disease while visiting northern Italy.In a week in which the rapidly spreading global epidemic jumped the fence into Europe, serious questions have emerged over the continent’s preparedness to deal with the disease, as health officials have delayed or struggled to trace initial sources of infection.By Friday, the first infections had reached the Netherlands, with cases identified in Amsterdam and the southern city of Tilburg, again both people who had recently returned from northern Italy and both unconnected to each other.With 821 cases in Italy, and an escalating outbreak in France, where 20 new cases were reported overnight, and in Germany, with 60 cases, a new reality had begun to impose itself by the week’s end, as a disease that appeared largely confined to China and Asia extended its grip to Europe’s towns and cities.And as the spread has accelerated – now confirmed in 57 countries from Nigeria (whose first confirmed infection was a recently returned Italian citizen) to Azerbaijan – the tone of official pronouncements has become notably more anxious, even as stock markets have crashed.The mounting sense of crisis has seen governments struggling to keep up as whole towns have been quarantined in Italy, citizens across Europe have been asked to self-isolate on returning from high-risk areas, and sports events and large public gatherings postponed or restricted.Amid collapsing air travel and holiday cancellations across Europe, face masks have become a common sight, as headlines and online Q\u0026ampAs from Der Spiegel to Le Monde, and Corriere della Sera to El País, have sought to advise worried readers.By Friday, it was Switzerland, where the government banned large-scale events including the imminent Geneva car show, which followed the cancellation of the annual Engadin ski marathon, one of the world’s largest cross-country skiing events, which attracts 14,000 participants, the day before.“In view of the current situation and the spread of the coronavirus, the federal council has categorised the situation in Switzerland as ‘special’ in terms of the Epidemics Act,” the Swiss cabinet announced. “The ban comes into immediate effect and will apply at least until 15 March.”In multiple cases in recent days, including two cases in the UK, health officials have traced the source of the infection back to Italy where hospital authorities are under investigation for delays in testing so-called “patient one” in the town of Codogno, a 38-year-old “super spreader” identified as “Mattia” who is suspected of contributing to the quick spread of the outbreak.Complicating the issue is the fact that Italian researchers at the Sacco hospital in Milan appear to have identified two variations of coronavirus, including a local variant that may have circulated for several weeks before the first identified case in northern Italy. The new coronavirus has found other routes into Europe as well. A case in Denmark has been linked to the burgeoning outbreak in Iran while two of the most recent French cases had both returned from holiday in Egypt.The situation in France, where 38 cases have been identified, more than double the number on Wednesday, has underlined the difficulties in tracing and managing the new coronavirus once infections have begun to take hold.Since Tuesday night, when a 60-year-old teacher from the Oise department of northern France died in a Paris hospital – the first local transmission with no links to China or Italy – a dozen other cases have emerged in the area linked to a military airbase in Creil.Attention has also increasingly focused on Europe’s second busiest airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle, as a potential source of other infections.All of which has sparked political leaders to warn that the continent is on the brink of an epidemic. On Wednesday, it was the French president, Emmanuel Macron.Flanked by clinicians as he visited La Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, after the first French death, Macron said: “We are facing a crisis, an epidemic that is coming. We know that we’re only at the beginning.”It was an identical message on Friday in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, where cases have topped 50, with the health minister, Jens Spahn, declaringthe country was “at the beginning of a coronavirus epidemic”.In Italy, meanwhile, authorities announced they were planning to reopen schools and museums in some of the areas less hard-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with even the hardest hit regions Lombardy and Veneto in the north leaning toward opening schools as well.“The aim is to return to normalcy,’’ the governor of Veneto, Luca Zaia, told state TV in an interview noting that it was an area where tourism was the biggest source of income, bringing in $18bn annually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b757cd67d841ec21d9f43a502779922a7244eb/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7f11537240d30ac7e3fe5533202812e","title":"coronavirus may have been in italy for weeks before it was detected","story":"Test results worry experts as new cases emerge in Nigeria, Mexico and New ZealandThe new coronavirus may have circulated in northern Italy for weeks before it was detected, seriously complicating efforts to track and control its rapid spread across Europe.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 20 Februrary, China has recorded 2,118 deaths\u0026nbspfrom the Covid-19 outbreak.\u0026nbspHealth officials have confirmed\u0026nbsp74,576 cases\u0026nbspin mainland\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspin total. More than 12,000 have recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least 28 other countries. Japan has 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and has recorded one death. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France and the Philippines.There have been nine recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. As of 17 February, a total of 4,501 people have been tested in the UK, of which 4,492 were confirmed negative.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.The claim follows laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.Massimo Galli, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Milan and director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, said preliminary evidence suggested the virus could have been spreading below the radar in the quarantined areas.“I can’t absolutely confirm any safe estimate of the time of the circulation of the virus in Italy, but … some first evidence suggest that the circulation of the virus is not so recent in Italy,” he said, amid suggestions the virus may have been present since mid-January.The beginnings of the outbreak, which has now infected more than 821 people in the country and has spread from Italy across Europe, were probably seeded at least two or three weeks before the first detection and possibly before flights between Italy and China were suspended at the end of January, say experts.The findings will be deeply concerning for health officials across Europe who have so far concentrated their containment efforts on identifying iniduals returning from high risk areas for the virus, including Italy, and people with symptoms as well as those who have come in contact with them.The new claim emerged as the World Health Organization warned that the outbreak was getting bigger and could soon appear in almost every country. The impact risk was now very high at a global level, it said.“The scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while,” a spokesman said.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.A viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 83,000 people globally, with almost 3,000 deaths. As the list of countries hit by the illness edged towards 60, with Mexico, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and the Netherlands reporting their first cases, the threats to livelihoods were increasingly eyed as warily as the threats to lives.While there were some tentative indications the outbreak may be slowing in China, South Korea’s tally of infections exceeded 2,300, while cases in France and Germany continued to rise.With new cases being reported across Europe, and the first case confirmed in sub-Saharan Africa – in an Italian man who recently returned to work in Nigeria – governments were increasingly moving towards proposing ever more stringent measures to control the global outbreakAs $5tn (£3.9tn) has been wiped off global stock markets amid fears over the impact of the virus, Switzerland moved to ban all gatherings of more than 1,000 people until 15 March, announcing the postponement of the Geneva Motor Show.The British budget airline easyJet announced it would axe 500 flights to Italy, alongside plans for freezes on hiring and pay, as other airlines announced similar measures.In Iran, where there has been one of the most serious outbreaks outside of China, with 34 people known to have died and 388 infected, the government announced on state television on Friday that all schools would be closing for three days from Saturday.“Based on assessments, it was felt that there was a need for closing all the schools in the country and for this reason all the schools in the country will be closed for three days starting from tomorrow,” the country’s health minister, Saeed Namaki, said.Similar measures were under way in Japan, prompting angry reactions from parents and teachers, who on Friday were told by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that all schools would close for a month.In another drastic move, the northern island of Hokkaido, where there has been the largest number of cases in Japan, on Friday declared a state of emergency. Its population of about 5 million people were told to refrain from venturing outside their homes over the weekend.Meanwhile authorities in Moscow announced they were deporting 88 people who they said had violated the country’s quarantine measures.The Nigerian case is just the third to be confirmed in Africa– a fact that has puzzled health specialists given the continent’s close ties to China – and was not picked up for 48 hours, part of a familiar pattern in the spread of the disease from California to Germany.According to Nigerian officials, the Italian man affected by Covid-19 stayed in a hotel near the airport on the evening of 24 February, then continued to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state.He was treated on 26 February at his company’s medical facility before health practitioners called government biosecurity officers, who transferred him on 27 February to a containment facility in Yaba, Lagos.This World Health Organization warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was “very, very high” and raised significant concerns about the ability of “fragile health systems” to cope.Experts, meanwhile, said the scale of the task involved in tracing suspected cases would put strain on developed countries.“The worry is that there may be other countries that are less prepared, and that the virus may become more widespread worldwide,” said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.In other developments, Mexico’s assistant health secretary announced that the country now had two confirmed cases of coronavirus.And at least 23 guests left H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife on Friday, four days into a 14-day imposed quarantine, after the Canary Islands regional government on Thursday cleared 130 holidaymakers to leave the hotel. About 700 holidaymakers remained quarantined in the compound."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2db7be379eb632f4722a26b086d966edebcc6aa/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87fef70348f2e338624d4c987dcc270e","title":"coronavirus truth myths flu covid 19 face masks","story":"The truth about the protective value of face masks and how easy it is to catch Covid-19Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe289a4dbddc5c162884c2df56db6fef49d98c0/0_207_6340_3804/master/6340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be785a2d52bac8b7eda1bf10f7b3687e","title":"delhis muslims pray under armed guard after week of riots","story":"Regular Friday prayers take place amid heightened sectarian tensions in India’s capitalMuslims in Delhi have held Friday prayers under the watch of riot police after a week in which 42 people were killed and hundreds injured during the city’s worst sectarian violence in decades.Scores of mosques in the north-east of the Indian capital held their first sermons since mobs armed with swords, guns and acid razed parts of the district on Monday.Paramilitary police patrolled the streets, still littered with broken shards of glass, stones and other debris.“If they burn our mosques, we will rebuild them again and pray,” said Mohammad Sulaiman, who was among about 180 men who prayed on the rooftop of a mosque that was set on fire in the unrest. “It’s our religious right and nobody can stop us from practicing our religion.”Five days after the riots started, hospitals were still trying to identify the dead as the toll continued to rise. Residents of the areas affected by the riots are still looking for missing relatives.Tensions between Hindu hardliners and Muslims protesting against the Hindu-first policies of Narendra Modi’s government had been building for months when the violence exploded on Sunday night, on the eve of Donald Trump’s first state visit to India.Police said they had detained more than 600 people over the unrest and were keeping a heavy presence in north-east Delhi.Dozens of volunteers stood outside the main mosque in the neighbourhood of Mustafabad, where some of the week’s worst violence took place, urging devotees to disperse immediately after prayers. “These are testing times. We have to be patient,” said the presiding imam after calling on his congregation to stay calm.Many in the neighbourhood were frightened after police barred Muslim worshippers from what was left of one of several mosques set ablaze by Hindu rioters on Monday.Nearby, a group of residents in the Hindu-dominated Shiv Vihar area blocked the lane leading to one of the local mosques with the burnt-out frames of motorcycles, which they said were set alight by Muslims. “No one will be allowed to enter until the rioters are caught,” they shouted at a crowd of Muslims seeking entry.“We don’t want violence,” said Saleem Mirza, as police told the Muslims to disperse to avoid any fresh trouble. “We want to live in peace, work for our children and live a normal life. We prayed for peace for everyone today.”India’s new citizenship law has triggered months of demonstrations between anti-government demonstrators and police. At least 30 people died in protest violence last year, mainly in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.Many of the country’s 200 million-strong Muslim minority fear the law – and a mooted citizens’ register – will leave them stateless.Modi has sought to allay the fears but in recent weeks politicians from the prime minister’s rightwing party have called the demonstrators “anti-nationals” and “traitors”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/687dff3bb6f20dbae4f32f04717b9fb44d9fa0b1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc86b2109fff0bae34075482bc31f72","title":"hand sanitiser or hand washing which more effective against coronavirus covid 19","story":"Supermarkets are running out of hand sanitiser as people rush to protect themselves from Covid-19. But does it beat using soap and water?As the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitiser gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online?The popularity of hand gels has not just been driven by the fear of pandemics. Lucrative opportunities to market them have pushed sales: they now come in pretty, child-friendly colours (bubblegum pink, bright blue) and with wellness-friendly scents (cinnamon, lavender) that are a far cry from the pungent-smelling version found in hospitals.Sanitisers have also evolved to include other active ingredients in place of alcohol, and there are recipes online for making your own. Good Housekeeping suggests vodka. Wellness bloggers plump for things such as witch-hazel and aloe vera. But are these effective in killing germs?Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that viruses are much more resistant to disinfectants than bacteria. Luckily, she says, coronavirus is an envelope virus, meaning it has a coating around it which the alcohol can attack, thereby eliminating the threat. (Norovirus and rhinovirus, by contrast, do not).This means that making your own sanitiser, while potentially effective against some bacteria, is not something Bloomfield would recommend. “It’s very unwise, dangerous, even,” she says. Shop-bought products also contain emollients to make them softer on the skin, without which you run the risk of hurting your hands. Getting the mix right at home would very tricky – so it is a big no-no.The key thing is when to use hand sanitiser. Covid-19 is a new illness, so no one knows exactly how it spreads. According to the NHS, it is likely that it is through cough droplets spread from person to person and very unlikely that it is transmitted through objects, be that packages or food.Bloomfield’s advice is to wash your hands with soap and water – or, if that is not possible, use hand gel – when you return to your “safe place”, by which she means your home, your desk or work station, or your seat on the train or plane, for example. Avoid touching anything you don’t need to touch, and be mindful of what you do touch – such as door handles and bus poles – and if you can’t wash your hands or use gel after coming into contact with things, do not touch your face.A virus needs a host – living cells – to reproduce: so don’t rub your eyes, or touch your mouth or any wounds if your hands are not clean. Keep your hands clear until you have access to gel or can wash them.The best option is soap and water. According to a 2019 study by the American Society for Microbiology, using running water and soap to wash your hands is more effective than a dab of gel that you have not quite rubbed in.Soap has mild antibacterial properties, but it does not kill viruses. It does remove dirt, though, so wet your hands with water, lather them up properly, on both sides, in between the fingers and under the nails, one hand and then the other. Rinse them thoroughly under running water for 20 seconds (or as the NHS puts it, the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday). Rinsing thoroughly is key to washing away any viruses. Dry your hands well with a disposable towel, then use that towel to turn off the tap before throwing it away.It might seem counterintuitive, but a study published in the medical journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012 concluded that, from a hygiene standpoint: “Paper towels are superior to air dryers.” This is because the towels dry your hands more quickly and more thoroughly than dryers do, and contamination happens more through wet hands than dry.Lisa Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner, says that stocks of hand sanitiser running low is a problem, but cautions against panic-buying. First, you don’t need to use very much – a little bottle will go a long way. In fact, a spokesman for the chemical products company Kao Corporation reportedly said last week that too much hand gel can cause irritation and skin sensitivity, by drying out the skin and removing natural oils. Damaged skin increases vulnerability to infection, so hand sanitisers, like most things, are best used in moderation – and only when handwashing is not an option.As Bloomfield puts it, it is not about being paranoid. She likens the process to vaccinations or wearing seatbelts: it is about being disciplined. While some companies have reportedly banned handshaking and other physical contact in an effort to avoid Covid-19, that is not official guidance.It is impossible not to engage with the world, so you just need to be cautious and methodical in your hand hygiene. “If everyone complies with good hygiene,” says Bloomfield, “then you’re making sure as far as possible that you’re not picking it up, and in the unlikely event you are infected you’re not spreading it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/469102ce7319d4cefd798fafe7117d13a1f8e653/0_128_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22618be1e59ab6f5ea3930c7cce96bed","title":"health groups step up uk coronavirus plans to reassure vulnerable","story":"Several organisations have seen an increase in calls for advice from anxious peopleOrganisations representing people vulnerable to coronavirus are stepping up preparations for a UK outbreak, in a bid to allay growing fears among those with underlying health conditions.According to the World Health Organization, older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to the virus.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.But people with respiratory conditions and compromised immune systems have described facing crippling anxiety about what could happen to them should an outbreak of coronavirus hit the UK.Georgie Wishart, a 30-year-old charity worker with ankylosing spondylitis, a condition which requires her to take immunosuppressants, described the daily battle to deal with her anxiety.“When it first came into the news, I was on the verge of having anxiety attacks because I didn’t know how I was going to cope,” she said. “There was genuinely a part of me thinking this is how I might die.“I keep reminding myself of the facts: there aren’t that many confirmed cases, precautions are being taken, and that if it becomes a problem I will deal with it. Because if I didn’t say that to myself every day, it would be really difficult to leave the house.”A 37-year-old business owner from Brighton, which has seen the highest concentration of UK cases, explained that his family decided to self-isolate to protect his asthmatic daughter.“We are just checking news websites all the time,” he said. “We have spoken over the phone with our GP, but he was a young guy that just read out the general Public Health England guidelines.”He home-schooled his daughters for two weeks before sending them back to school after finding more statistics regarding children. Current evidence suggests that children do not appear to be vulnerable, with few cases of children testing positive for the virus.Several organisations representing people with underlying health conditions said they have seen an increase in calls for advice.Asthma UK has set up a crisis management group to track the progress of the virus. Calls to the charity are increasing daily, said Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK.“We know that the risk to people with asthma from viruses like coronavirus is higher than the general population, so we are encouraging people to make sure their asthma is well-managed,” she said.Anxiety is high among other patient groups, such as people with cystic fibrosis, which can result in respiratory complications. Kevin Southern, a consultant paediatrician and cystic fibrosis specialist said: “It is very difficult to be reassuring at the moment, as it is unknown territory, but we are telling our families to follow the official advice, to be prepared, have extra antibiotics in the house and contact their teams with any concerns.” Advice from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust states that there is currently no need for people with cystic fibrosis to limit their activities.Susan Walsh from the PID UK said they were advising people to follow PHE guidelines. “We are also telling people that if they do feel ill they should contact a doctor promptly with details of their diagnosis, medication and immunology centre,” she said. “It’s a balance between raising awareness, but not creating great fear. It needs to be handled very carefully.”Derek Nott, director of support line services at Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was understandable that people with cancer “may be feeling more anxious” and said anyone concerned that they may have been in contact with someone with coronavirus, should follow advice from Public Health England, and call 111. He added that people needing clinical, practical and financial information should call the Macmillan support line on 0800 808 0000.Several people the  spoke to said they were struggling to cope with the psychological weight of worrying about coronavirus. One 28-year-old PR consultant whose mother has late-stage ovarian cancer, said she had never “felt so totally out of control”.“Cancer robs people of a lot of choices and it feels like coronavirus is limiting me and my family even more,” she said. “I am desperate for someone to say something comforting. I yearn for an expert on coronavirus or cancer to tell us it’ll all be ok.”The Mental Health Foundation, which has advice for people with coronavirus-related anxiety and stress, said the uncertainty around coronavirus could breed fear. “The huge volume of news, fake news and comment about the virus can also leave people stressed out and afraid of what’s ahead,” said a spokesperson. The foundation suggests getting information from reliable sources, following hygiene advice, using stress management techniques and limiting news consumption.All the charities and iniduals the  spoke to called for members of the public to be aware that their hygiene habits were not only key to their own health and that of their families, but to vulnerable people throughout the country.“I am much more aware of the risk of catching infection and I am very diligent with my own hygiene but you really notice how other people just aren’t,” said Wishart, who travels into central London daily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7f2bf3423ec463fe255fd966c4ebdd1064c7ee/0_202_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e144013d729437f0467bfe679edd6696","title":"luxembourg public transport free nationwide congestion","story":"Country is first to implement measure nationwide in attempt to reduce congestionLuxembourg is to become the first country to offer a free public transport system, as the government tries to reduce particularly dense car traffic.Some cities have taken similar partial measures but the transport ministry said it was the only time such a decision had encompassed an entire country.Luxembourg City, the capital, where a tramway has been under construction for several years, is notoriously bad for traffic jams.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2223eff7c997b6987bfa10544e4bf24c8695f47/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d686ac57925ee97776aeefa57a4846f","title":"working coronavirus test kits promised soon in all us states after faults found","story":"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it aimed to have tests for coronavirus out and working in every US state by the end of next week, after the first test kits distributed were found to be faulty.Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a call with reporters on Friday that the agency found a way to use the test kits without the faulty component and also would be sending more tests out around the country.Messonnier also confirmed that there is still only one person who tested positive for coronavirus without the CDC knowing how or where they contracted it.“It’s possible this could be the first incident of community spread, meaning the illness might have been acquired through an unknown exposure in the community,” Messonnier said. “It’s also possible, however, that a thorough investigation may show that the patient had exposure through contact with a returned traveler who was infected.”Messonnier disputed accusations that the CDC initially denied a request to test the person in California. She said the CDC’s first record of a call asking about the inidual was on 23 February and the agency has not said no to any requests for testing.There are concerns that the count of coronavirus cases in the US is an underestimate because of low testing rates. While South Korea has tested more than 35,000 people for coronavirus, the US has tested 426 people, excluding those returned on evacuation flights, according to the Washington Post.Messonnier said the US’s low case count could be attributed to early, aggressive containment strategies, such as focusing surveillance on people who had the highest risk of contracting the illness. But she did not directly address how limited testing could affect the case count.The kits initially sent out by the CDC were found to be faulty, but Messonnier said as of Friday, labs could use those kits with a modification. The agency is also sending out more kits across the country. “Our goal is to have every state and local health department online, doing their own testing, by the end of next week,” Messonier said.After issuing a serious warning on Tuesday that the spread of coronavirus in the US was inevitable, Messonnier offered a less dire picture of the outbreak on Friday.“There certainly is the possibility of additional cases and we will continue to work aggressively to keep that number low,” Messonnier said. “We hope that if there is spread, that spread will be limited, and that any disease in the US will be mild.”The US has seen a dramatic drop in travelers from China, which may have helped slow the spread of coronavirus, according to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Friday.The authors said the US should still be prepared for coronavirus to gain a foothold in the US, which might require isolation of ill people, closing schools and working from home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c182c55d1854e6002f6aeec27921f2dc935ca6/67_402_4793_2878/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf00ebab0d785815a0ff400ee89c316","title":"coronavirus spreads across the world in pictures","story":"As cases of people infected with the coronavirus or Covid-19 grow rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the rest of the world is bracing for a pandemic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8020db53fccd949bf145726e0281a492d875bfde/0_0_4898_3266/master/4898.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=502af0d3ef58ec657c2f3e6431084fe3 1400w","title":"coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update","story":"Italian civil protection chief confirms 820 cases in the country while Boris Johnson says Covid-19 is UK government’s top priority. Follow live newsTracing the origins of the latest case of coronavirus - the first to have been caught within the UK - will be “crucial” in preventing more extensive spread, experts have said. Prof Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, has said:This case – a person testing positive for novel coronavirus with no known link to an affected area or known case – marks a new chapter for the UK, and it will be crucial to understand where the infection came from to try and prevent more extensive spread.This was always a concern – this is a virus that frequently causes symptoms very similar to mild flu or a common cold, and it’s easily transmitted from person to person. This means it can easily go under the radar.This was always a real possibility and one of the reasons that the government introduced more extensive surveillance. This will prove invaluable and help us understand where this virus is and who is infected. This will be essential if we are to implement measures to slow its spread and allow our NHS to respond. We can also do our bit by making sure that we are vigilant with our own personal hygiene.Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, has said:Given the increase in cases around Europe and outside of China, it’s unsurprising to see a probable case of human-to-human transmission here in the UK. There will be significant efforts to look at how this patient came to be infected, who is the index case in the UK, and to see if any there are any other secondary cases. Though this is a notable development here in the UK, the overall risks to the public right now remain unchanged.Dr Stephen Griffin, an associate professor at the University of Leeds’ section of infection and immunity, has said: Whilst the first person-to-person transmission within the UK may come as a shock to many, it was really only a matter of time. It is increasingly clear that SARS-COV2 is capable of being spread by people showing very mild, or perhaps completely unnoticeable symptoms, which has allowed it to escape the lockdown in China, albeit within a relatively small number of iniduals.However, this has been sufficient to promote the seeding of small, sporadic community outbreaks in numerous countries, the majority of which have been successfully contained. Nevertheless, we have also seen the beginnings of much larger outbreaks in countries like South Korea and elsewhere, which are likely to have been seeded after a similar fashion. This highlights the challenge faced once the virus becomes established.What now becomes critically important is our ability to identify, isolate and care for infected iniduals, and to trace their recent contacts.If localised outbreaks remain contained then it should be possible to limit the impact upon the UK. However, I suspect the frequency of small outbreaks might increase in coming weeks as the source countries of imported cases become more erse.If we experience a burgeoning epidemic as seen in South Korea, it will represent a significant challenge to our already stretched NHS and public health infrastructure. As directed by WHO, we should use this time window to invest and prepare for such a potential outbreak, whether it happens or not. In particular, we must ensure that our health care professionals are equipped with the appropriate environments and protective measures such that they can provide the necessary care to the public with minimal risk that they might themselves become infected.Downing Street will allow ministers to go on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme amid public concern over the spread of coronavirus, according to the Times:El Salvador’s migration authorities will be ordered to deny entry to travellers arriving from Iran, a health measure intended to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the former nation’s president Nayib Bukele has said.Bukele said on Twitter that Salvadorans and diplomats arriving from the Middle Eastern country, which has one of the largest outbreaks outside China, will have to spend 30 days in quarantine.

As of today, 93 tests have been completed, with 92 confirmed as negative and one as presumed positive,” it said.Dr Jillian Johnston, consultant in health protection at the PHA, said: “All stages of the inidual’s journey were identified and those who came into closest contact have been traced and contacted with public health advice and guidance. I would emphasise that members of the public who have travelled between Dublin and Belfast using public transport need not be concerned”.\u0026nbspTrain sanitisedHowever, the Enterprise train that services the Dublin-to-Belfast route was sanitised overnight as a “precautionary measure”.“We’ve had no confirmation at this time that the person travelled by Enterprise, but both Iarnród Éireann and Translink undertook a sanitising clean of the Enterprise fleet as a precautionary measure,” Irish Rail spokesman Barry Kenny said.He said the company was “working internally on contingencies in the event of cases of Covid-19 in Ireland or on our services and in our workplaces”. Iarnród Éireann would “engage and be guided by the relevant health and other government agencies – including the NTA and other transport operators - to inform decisions while the Covid-19 issue continues.”Mr Kenny encouraged customers and staff to “also follow the guidance of the HSE at all times”.The patient is the first known case of the virus on the island of Ireland as it spreads around the world causing thousands of deaths and concern that it may spiral out of control.Religious servicesThe sign of peace is to be suspended at Masses in the diocese of Down and Connor in response to the coronavirus.The diocese includes Belfast and most of counties Antrim and Down.On Friday advice was circulated to all clergy in the diocese outlining measures to be implemented within parishes.According to the guidelines, holy communion should be administered into the hands only and not directly onto the tongue, and only the celebrant should receive from the chalice during Mass.Ministers of the eucharist should wash their hands with particular care before and after distributing holy communionHoly water fonts should be drained and not used.Parishes have also been asked to consider providing alcohol-based hand sanitiser gels or facilities at all entrance and exit doors to the church, and to ensure the regular cleaning of surfaces such as door handles and tables.“These measures are preventative and should not in any way raise any existing levels of concern,” the guidance stated.The diocese said the decision had been taken in light of advice from the Public Health Agency and communication from the Irish Episcopal Conference Secretariat.The Archdiocese of Dublin has also said if members of the congregation, religious leaders or others involved in religious services feel ill and may have Covid-19, even if their symptoms are mild, they should stay at home.SkypeThe Church of Ireland issued guidelines to all its parishes which stipulate that physical interaction during services, including the sign of peace, should be suspended. “Clergy may choose to give the congregation permission to carry out an alternative sign of peace that does not involve hand contact (eg a smile, nod or bow) if so wished,” the guidelines state.“Shaking hands on greeting and departure at religious servicesgatherings should be suspended.”Everyone administering holy communion should wash their hands or use alcohol-based hand gel before beginning.“Holy Communion should be administered only in one kind (bread) and placed into the hands only and not onto the tongue. Only the celebrant should drink from the chalice,” it added.The church’s duty of care “extends to members of the clergy,” the guidelines state. “If you have influenza-type symptoms, do not call the clergy for pastoral visitation. Pastoral support for parishioners who are unable to attend church services should be provided by telephone or online (eg Skype).”Meanwhile the list of countries hit by Covid-19, the coronavirus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is edging towards 60 with Mexico, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and the Netherlands reporting their first cases.A patient diagnosed with coronavirus in England has become the first to catch the illness within the UK. Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said it was not yet clear if the virus had been passed on from somebody who had recently travelled abroad. It marked the 20th confirmed case in the UK - 18 of which were in England, one in Northern Ireland and one in Wales.The news came after a British man became the first UK citizen to die from coronavirus. The man, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship was the sixth person from the vessel, which has been quarantined off the Japan’s coast amid the outbreak, to have died.Director general of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said the outbreak “has pandemic potential”.RecessionStocks have fallen and in Italy, where the count of 650 cases is growing, hotel bookings are dropping and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has raised the possibility of recession.Some have attempted to exploit the crisis for financial gain, with 20 people in Italy arrested for selling masks they fraudulently claimed provided complete protection from the virus. Police said they were selling them for as much as €5,000 each.Japan’s schools are closing and the country’s Hokkaido island has declared a state of emergency, with its governor urging residents to stay at home over the weekend.The Swiss government has banned events with more than 1,000 people, while at the Cologne Cathedral in Germany, basins of holy water have been emptied amid concerns it could spread germs.Globally, more than 85,000 people have fallen ill with Covid-19. China, though hardest hit, has seen lower numbers of new infections, with 327 additional cases reported on Friday, bringing the country’s total to 78,824. Another 44 people died there on Friday bringing the total to 2,788.South Korea has recorded 2,337 cases, the most outside of China.France and Germany are also seeing increases, with dozens of infections.ContactedThe Minister for Health Simon Harris said everything that can be done from a public health point of view in Ireland to deal with the corona virus is being done.He said protocols in place for handling a positive coronavirus case including contact tracing and links between health authorities on both sides of the border had worked very well after confirmation of a test result was received on Thursday evening.The Minister said he wanted to give an assurance that if people had been in close contact with the person at the centre of the positive coronavirus case, they would already have been contacted by public health authorities.He said anyone who had not been contacted did not need to be concerned.Asked at a press conference on Friday as to why more information was not available about the person with coronavirus who had travelled through Dublin airport in recent days, Mr Harris said it was not his job to feed the curiosity of people in relation to a journey made by a patient.“We are following best public health practice in this regard. We are protecting patient confidential and operating in accordance with World Health Organisation guidelines.”If health authorities were concerned that people who had been in close contact with the person in Northern Ireland could not be contacted “we would have issued a public notice” .“There is no need to refresh your Twitter feed to find out if there is a case of Covid 19 in Ireland.”Scaled upThe head of the HSE Paul Reid said the health service was making significant preparations to deal with the virus. He said the HSE had purchased 4.5 million gloves and 5 million masks. The HSE was also looking at increasing intensive care facilities across the health system.It was also looking at arrangements to test people at home for the corona virus.The Mater Hospital in Dublin was the main national ICU facility in the first instance, he said, but the HSE was also looking across the system at how ICU facilities could be scaled up.“If we do, we would move towards our high dependency units . If it is scaled up further (we would look at) operating theatres or even private room capacity. There is plenty of scale up and we are currently looking at surge capacity should that be needed,” he said.Mr Reid said in the last few days its call centre had dealt with about 2,500 enquiries and around 300 of those had been referred to public health authorities.He said about 110 people had been tested for the virus so far and there had been no confirmed cases in the Republic.ImportedNorthern Ireland’s Public Health Agency said on Thursday\u0026nbspnight that the patient diagnosed with coronavirus there is “receiving specialist care” and staff are working rapidly to identify any contacts the patient had with the aim of preventing further spread”.A sample from the patient has been sent to the UK for verification but it has been described at this stage as a “presumptive positive test for coronavirus”.The announcement was made at a briefing by the agency in Belfast on Thursday evening.The Department of Health’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, on Friday said it is “likely” that another case or cases would be imported into Ireland as the virus spread.“We’ve seen a growth in the number of countries who had importation of cases from some of the infected areas that have been identified,” Dr Holohan said. “We’ve seen over the course of the week, a number of countries appearing in countries across Europe. We anticipate that that’s a likely situation here.”Dr Holohan reiterated there are no confirmed cases in the Republic. With regard to the cancellation of events, he said they were working on criteria around gatherings that might “create of constitute a specific risk given their nature”.“We don’t anticipate a situation where cancellations of mass gatherings form a significant part of our management of this,” he added.On Friday morning, the Department of Justice and Equality confirmed that the citizenship ceremonies scheduled for the 2nd and 3rd of March in the INEC Killarney will proceed as planned.There were fears that the ceremonies would be cancelled."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187993.1582905122!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus myths that have gained traction","story":"Minister for Health Simon harris has visited Dublin Airport where he met with HSE staff providing information about the coronavirus to people as they arrive in Ireland.

Photographer: Geert Vanden WijngaertBloombergIn the two months since a novel strain of coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, panic has spread throughout social media.The World Health Organisation has expressed concern about an “infodemic”, warning that misinformation about the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19 illness) is causing harmful stigmatisation and discrimination.With a focus on doomsday scenarios, fake news has created false but believable memes to feed people’s understandable thirst for information. But despite social media giants attempting to tackle misinformation about the new virus, the spread of false news continues.A 2018 Rand corporation survey found that of all categories of fake news, health news is the worst. Vaccines have been a particular target now false news sources are blurring the line between opinion and fact about the new illness, Covid-19.Here are some of the myths that have gained traction around Covid-19.Getting coronavirus is a death sentenceFact: The vast majority of cases are mild and self-limiting. The new bug has a mortality rate of about 2 per cent. Even those admitted to hospital with a severe illness are most likely to fully recover. Researchers tracking the disease report 17,000 recoveries from the illness. And if it had a high mortality rate, we would not be seeing the easy spread of Covid-19.Wearing a face mask will protect you from itFact: Despite global panic buying there is no evidence that standard disposable surgical face masks offer protection against the virus. Because they are not custom-fit and are loose, these masks may allow tiny droplets from an infected person to get into the wearer’s nose, mouth or eyes. In addition, anyone with the virus on their hands who touches their face under a mask could become infected. However, people diagnosed with Sars-CoV-2 who wear these masks lessen their chance of infecting those around them.A commercial hand sanitiser is only way to kill itFact: While washing hands is the single most important action you can take to stop the spread of the virus, it must be done thoroughly. Wash for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, including between the fingers and the area around the base of the thumb. If using a sanitiser, for it to be effective, make sure it contains at least 60 per cent alcohol.Cannabis and garlic protect against the virusFact: A YouTube video of a doctor discussing how cannabis can boost a person’s immunity to the coronavirus is a fake. Medical experts emphasise there is no evidence to suggest that cannabis improves immunity against the virus.Online claims that Covid-19 can be cured overnight by drinking freshly boiled garlic water are untrue. There is no specific anti-viral treatment for it.Closing borders and airports will stop the spreadFact: Past experience suggests there is no benefit to measures such as these. If anything, they promote fear and panic. And they probably make it more likely that people with symptoms of Sars-CoV-2 won’t come forward and identify themselves to health professionals."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4188186.1582916466!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus travel insurer outlines criteria for payouts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA man wearing a protective mask in Venice. Photograph: Claudio FurlanLapresse via APThe company that underwrites much of the travel insurance in Ireland has issued fresh guidelines for people who may be travelling outside the country in the days, weeks and months ahead and are increasingly concerned about the impact of the spread of the coronavirus on their plans.Mapfre, which underwrites many policies here and also sells under its brand insureandgo.ie, has outlined how and when people will be able to make claims.The people immediately affected are those who were due to travel to the Hubei province of China and had a trip booked before January 23rd.Anyone due to travel to mainland China (not including Hong Kong and Macao) with a trip booked before January 28th, and people booked to travel to Codogno, Castiglione d’Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano in northern Italy with a trip booked before February 24th are also among the first affected.The insurer said people in these categories may be in a position to claim as the Department of Foreign Affairs had said on before the date of departure, that it had advised against “All but essential travel”:“If the cancellation section of your policy lists as an insured peril cover where the Irish Government announces that travellers are recommended to avoid the country or area you have planned to visit, we will consider cancellation claims within 48 hours of your intended date of departure as long as that advice is in place,” Mapfre said.Cancellation claimsIt said that if policies did not include cover as above, it would consider cancellation claims “on an ex-gratia basis, and within 48 hours of your intended date of departure as long that advice is in place”.It also advised people to refer to their policy documentation for details of cover available.“We will pay you for any unused travel and accommodation costs if you have to cancel your trip and any necessary extra travel costs if you have to cut your trip short,” Mapfre said.It reminded people that it would only consider claims where the date they bought the travel insurance policy preceded the date the Department of Foreign Affairs advised against travel to the intended destination and would only consider non-refundable expenses on your travel insurance policy.It said that, in the first instance, people should approach airlines, tour operators or travel companies for a possible refund or to see if they will amend itineraries.People who want to rearrange trip dates, once they are not making a claim, can have a policy transferred to a later date to cover the new trip as long as it is within three months of the original departure date, is for the same or no longer duration and is to the same geographical area.Check policyThe company has urged people to check their policy terms and conditions to see exactly what cover their policy provides and how much they can claim for, as different policies vary.The company also reminded people that if their trip did not involve travel to one of the affected areas but they were concerned about the risk of going on a trip, its travel insurance policies would not provide cover “for disinclination to travel”.The statement said that although it sympathised that people might no longer want to travel on their trip, unless the department advised against travel to their intended destination, there would be “no cover for cancelling or cutting short your trip”.People who are stuck overseas and unable to return to the Republic will have their existing policy automatically extended in line with the terms and conditions for up to 30 days to cover them until they are reasonably able to return home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185547.1582834321!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what we know so far about how ireland is affected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing protective face masks arrive at the Hongqiao railway station in Shanghai. Photograph: Noel CelisAFP via Getty ImagesHave there been any cases here so far?One case was confirmed in Northern Ireland on Thursday evening. The patient travelled from Italy through the Republic and into Northern Ireland.The Department of Health has said that more than 100 people have been tested for coronavirus in the Republic so far and all results have come back negative.What about Irish people abroad? Especially those who may be returning?Two Irish-German passengers who were on board the Princess Diamond cruise ship docked off Yokohama, Japan, tested positive for the coronavirus. They are not normally resident in Ireland are being treated in hospital in Japan.Elsewhere, a hotel on the island of Tenerife was placed under quarantine when an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the coronavirus. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance to a number of Irish citizens in the area.Two other Irish citizens were quarantined in Liverpool in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan. Both subsequently left quarantine and reported they were healthy and safe.But does all this mean we should avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.It has also advised Irish citizens not to travel to Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, as well as four regions in northern Italy where restrictions have been imposed, and which have direct flights with Ireland.What if I’ve recently been to an affected area?Anyone who has been to an affected region (mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and call their GP.The same applies to anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of the virus in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms. Anyone who has been to an affected region in the last 14 days, and are well, should visit hse.ie for advice.So is this going to mess a lot of people’s holiday plans up?A number of secondary schools across Ireland have decided to cancel school trips to Italy in light of the latest travel advice.Alexandra College in Dublin confirmed it had cancelled the school’s annual trip for transition year students to Italy after a teacher, who organised the trip and is from Italy, consulted with local Italian authorities.Irish holiday makers are also reportedly cancelling trips to Italy. In some cases, these included bookings for holidays that are not due to take place until the summer. Travel agents have also said that, for now, Irish people are stalling on making bookings.Is that affecting airlines? And what about other businesses, and our tourism industry?The airlines are feeling the pinch alright. Earlier this week, investors began ditching stocks that they believed were vulnerable to a European outbreak. One of the biggest was Ryanair, whose shares tumbled 13.4 per cent in Dublin.Ryanair says all its flights are operating as normal but added that it would follow any public health instructions that were issued. The same is true of Aer Lingus.Elsewhere, Junayeo Air confirmed last week that it had decided to postpone the scheduled launch of its proposed Dublin-Shanghai service on March 29th until further notice.It’s not just the airlines either. Many Irish companies have operations in affected regions or depend on them for supply lines, and they are also dealing with some of the fallout. For example, one of our biggest companies, Kerry Group, said sales in China are set to fall by about 30 per cent in the first quarter of the year.What are we going to do about citizens from affected regions coming here?The DAA, which operates Dublin Airport, has said it is currently “business as usual” at the airport with flights from affected regions landing as normal.The Government is doing what it can to limit mass influxes from affected regions. The surge in cases in Italy has forced the cancellation of Ulster’s Pro14 rugby game against Benetton in Treviso due to take place on Saturday.Minister for Health Simon Harris has also called for the Ireland’s Six Nations rugby match against Italy on March 7th to be called off. Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said more sporting fixtures could be cancelled if necessary to prevent the spread.Could we not just screen people as they arrive in Ireland?No. Entry screening for Covid-19 “doesn’t work, wouldn’t work” and would be a “waste of resources”, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said.Fair enough. Can expect other big events, like the St Patrick’s Day Festival, to follow suit then?The cancellation of mass gatherings, such as large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, “may be justified in exceptional circumstances” according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Decisions to cancel however will be co-ordinated with organisers and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis. But it’s possible we will see more major events cancelled.What about schools?During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control said.“There is also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now though, it seems unlikely.What are the chances of someone testing positive for the virus here and what happens then?Harris has said the outbreak in Italy and in neighbouring countries means the chances of an Irish case in the coming days or weeks has increased significantly.He has designated the virus as a notifiable disease, which means doctors will be obliged to routinely notify the HSE when a case is diagnosed.The Department of Health is also understood to be looking at bringing the condition under legislation that would allow for a person with the virus to be detained and isolated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187197.1582833494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what should you do if you think you might have coronavirus","story":"At a media briefing in Dublin the HSE has said that  there have been 90 suspected cases of  Covid-19 tested here, but none have been positive for the virus.

Photograph: iStockThe first thing to consider is have you possible symptoms – coughing, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, fever?Then, have you come back from any of the at-risk areas in the past 14 days – China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Iran, and four regions of Northern Italy: Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna or Piedmont?Do you think you have been in contact with someone confirmed with the virus? Or were you in a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated?If you fit any of these criteria, call your GP. Do not call to the surgery in person.The GP will question you as per a normal medical consultation. Based on the outcome of this discussion, he or she may then contact the local public health doctor for further consultation.If the GP decides you need to be tested, he or she will contact the emergency department of your local hospital, where staff will be informed that a person requiring testing is arriving. Staff will make the appropriate arrangements, such as donning protective gear.New protocolThe protocol from this point on changed earlier this week. Before that point, people requiring tests were transported by ambulance to hospital. This will still apply in cases where people are very ill, but in cases where the person is deemed to be fit and able to travel, he or she can be brought to hospital by someone such as a partner or other household contact.On arrival the person is tested and clinically assessed. If necessary on clinical grounds, they may be hospitalised, but those deemed to be fit to go home will be sent home.Once home, they will be contacted by a public health specialist providing advice about self-isolation.The test is sent to the National Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD where a result is ready within 24 hours. Effectively this means samples received in the afternoon will not receive results until the following day.If the test is negative – as all in the Republic have been to date – the person is free to resume normal life, but advised to keep an eye on any symptoms.If the result is positive, the person would be taken to hospital, mostly likely the national isolation unit at the Mater hospital in Dublin, and treated there."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Inidual speaker\u0026rsquos award goes to Rachael Mullally representing UCD LawDriver and passenger pronounced dead at scene of collision with jeep on Friday eveningMet \u0026Eacuteireann says people should \u0026ldquostop everything and stay indoors during red alertStudents nationwide carry out protests against proposed on-campus rental increasesSign of peace is to be suspended at Masses and holy water fonts emptiedBest-selling novelist appeals construction plan over \u0026lsquocatastrophic\u0026rsquo impact on privacyAnti-immigrant Facebook platform follows stream of similar pages in recent monthsKnives, hachetes and hatchets seized by police after disturbance appear new, court toldThe Tartan Spartan had been sent for slaughterFine Gael\u0026rsquos Kate O\u0026rsquoConnell and Michelle Mulherin not selected by party for electionJudge said defendant continued with work in blatant disregard of notifications to stop\u0026lsquoNo cover\u0026rsquo for cancelling trips other than to places cited by Department of Foreign AffairsSlew of states report Covid-19 cases including Mexico, Nigeria, Denmark, NetherlandsKeith Johnson (43) found guilty of helping murderer buy tools\u0026lsquoShe will never feed herself, never go to school, never walk up the aisle,\u0026rsquo mother saysWelsh-born Sionad Jones tells court of Sitka spruce\u0026rsquos harmful effect on Irish bioersityMental Health Commission raises concerns about \u0026lsquohigh-risk non-compliance\u0026rsquo in three centresDonegal man jailed for seven years for raping teenager in a field and then in her homeFour people found guilty in trial over death of 61-year-old with a fifth pleading guiltyLabour likely to be asked to alter stance on staying outside fray of building administrationStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187838.1582894224!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice wash your hands and avoid hugging kissing and hand shaking","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A spectator wears a face mask at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis ATP Championships  in Dubai. Photograph: Ali HaiderEPAWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world and one case now confirmed on the island of Ireland, much of the focus is on how to deal with the illness and care for the sick.But equally important, if not more important, in what is still a containment phase is how to minimise the odds of contracting the virus and stay safe as the illness spreads.The first and best advice is not to panic. Hysteria is a real enemy in a situation like this.“We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,” World Health Organisation head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said on Thursday night. “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,” he added.There has been a huge amount of speculation about the illness, much of which is ill-informed or speculative but what we know for certain now is that the Covid-19 coronavirus is new and scientists are assessing how it spreads.We also know that similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets.’Social distancing’That is why so-called “social distancing” will be important in the days ahead. That means you should move at least a metre away from anyone who appears ill if you can. Avoid shaking hands or hugging or kissing people as part of a greeting.There has also been a lot of talk in recent days about face masks and alcohol based hand sanitisers but - by far - the most effective way to protect yourself is by regularly washing your hands.At the risk of stating the obvious, a quick rinse under the tap doesn’t get rid of dangerous germs. Hands need to be vigourously washed with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds or the length of time it takes to sing the Happy Birthday song twice.Many people don’t dry their hands either which is why it is important to remember that damp actually can help germs to breed and allows them to spread more easily onto whatever you touch next.According to advice from the HSE, in addition to hand-washing people should also use alcohol based hand sanatisers if necessary.It is also important to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough and sneeze and to put used tissues into a bin and then wash your hands again. People should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth if their hands are not cleanThe HSE advice also reminds people to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.With regard to face masks the HSE advice is simple. People who are well or have no symptoms of illness should not use them. “There’s no evidence that using masks is of any benefit if you are not sick,” it says.People who should use face masks if they have or may have coronavirus or if they are in close contact with someone who has or may have coronavirus or if they are are a healthcare worker in close contact with people who have or may have coronavirus.Healthcare workersAccording to the HSE people who work in a healthcare setting can best protect themselves by regularly washing their hands and covering their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing.Health care professionals dealing with cases or suspected cases of the coronavirus are being advised to wear personal protective equipment which includes a surgical face mask, a face shield or goggles, gloves and a clean, non-sterile, disposable long-sleeved gown. “If this is not available, wear a plastic apron and roll up sleevesIrish people displayed a propensity to stockpile during the two or three days that the beast from the east made its presence felt two years ago.Bread supplies dried up and fresh meat and dairy disappeared from supermarkets as supply chains displayed a worrying fragility.Will something similar happen if panic about the coronavirus mounts? Possibly.Certainly in other locations concerns over shortages have led some people to stockpile and there has been evidence of panic buying.Already in this country all the face masks have disappeared from pharmacies and even hardware shops.“I don’t think it is necessary, and I certainly don’t advise it,” Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh to New Scientist this week.Food suplyJennifer Nuzzo at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland told the same magazine that people should ensure they have at least three days’ food supply to hand as they are advised to do during hurricanes. “I’m not saying it’s specifically necessary in this case,” she said.Meanwhile virology blogger Ian Mackay recommended slowly building up a “pandemic stash”.Certainly do not stock up on prescription medicines - not only will you almost certainly not need them but you may make it harder for those that do need them to access them. Which takes us back to the start and the best advice which is don’t panic.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187810.1582892655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus north s health chief confident virus can be contained","story":"Minister for Health Simon harris has visited Dublin Airport where he met with HSE staff providing information about the coronavirus to people as they arrive in Ireland.

Photograph: Michael McHughPA WireNorthern Ireland’s chief medical officer has said he is confident health authorities in Northern Ireland will be able to contain the spread of coronavirus. The first case on the island of Ireland was confirmed on Thursday in a woman who had flown to Dublin from northern Italy and then travelled on to Belfast. She followed the advice from the Public Health Agency (PHA) and contacted her GP and then “self-isolated” at home while awaiting the results of tests. The “presumptive positive” result has been sent to laboratories in England for verification. The PHA has said she is receiving “specialist care”. Dr Michael McBride said at a press conference in Belfast on Thursday that a “small number” of those in contact with the patient had been identified as at risk. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday, he said he was “confident that the steps that the inidual took upon return to Northern Ireland, based on advice that was relayed, and indeed the prompt and rapid action by PHA colleagues, will ensure that we’re able to contain this,” he said. “What we do not have in Northern Ireland at this point in time, and this is really crucially important, we do not have cases in Northern Ireland that have occurred in Northern Ireland,” he said. “We don’t have community transmission in Northern Ireland.” “Basically speaking, that has enabled the authorities to put in step everything that has been planned and prepared for to limit spread of the virus to the wider community,” he said. On Friday, Dr John Cuddihy, the director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, told journalists in Dublin that “each of the stages of this person’s journey have been identified and all relevant contacts in all of those stages of transport have been contacted (and) traced.” People who sat within two rows of the woman on the plane have been contacted. It is not clear whether she travelled from Dublin to Belfast by public transport, but both Iarnród Éireann and Translink have carried out a “sanitising clean” of the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise trains as a “precautionary measure”. A special isolation unit has been established at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

He recalled how, on arriving in New York in 2017, he soon realised that each event he hosted or addressed was almost exclusively white. “I felt, this is not a reflection of the United States, it’s not a reflection of New York, and increasingly it’s not a reflection of Ireland, where now one in six people in Ireland were born outside the island.”The aim of the initiative is to examine the connections between black identity and Irishness, in the process opening up a dialogue about definitions of Irish-American identity.Among those who spoke at the event was Dennis Brownlee, an African-American who will head the organisation. He learned about his Irish heritage while growing up in Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1960s. Civil rights “My mother kept telling me we had some Scotch Irish heritage, but at the time it didn’t really mean much to me,” he said. “During the civil rights movement and the onset of black power,\u0026nbspI was much more concerned and interested in identifying with that black part of my identity.” It was only years later that he began to connect with this part of his identity when he moved next door to Stella O’Leary, the head of the Irish American Democrats in Washington DC, who encouraged him to pursue his Irish links. Through research, including a recent visit to Dublin, he learned more about his ancestors, including his links to Belfast on his maternal side.Keith Wright, chair of the New York county Democratic Party and son of the late African-American New York State supreme court justice Bruce Wright, said he has vivid memories of his grandmother who was from Ireland. But he never really felt connected to Irish-America while growing up in Harlem. “The Patrick’s Day parades, the Irish centres . . . it was not really part of my identity,” he said.Ensuring that African-Americans can connect with their Irish heritage is a central aim of the new initiative. But positing a more inclusive version of Irish-American identity also involves some difficult conversations about the legacy of slavery, race relations and conquest in America.Many of the unions between Irish and African-Americans were forged through rape and coercion. Many Irish were slave-owners, and there is a long history in America of indentured slaves being forced into sexual activity. There was also the difficult relationship between working-class Irish immigrants and the black community, as both competed for work and respect in 19th-century America. This reached its zenith with the draft riots of 1863, which saw an Irish-dominated mob kill dozens of people, mostly African-Americans, in three days of race riots in New York.Racial conventions defiedBut there were also plenty of positive stories – of love, respect and shared cultures – which saw many Irish immigrants defy the racial conventions of the time.Research by Virginia Ferris, for example, shows that Irish and African-American interracial families lived together in New York’s eighth ward in the years after the civil war.Further north, in Seneca Village, which was later dismantled to make way for Central Park, African-Americans and Irish lived side by side.Recovering the lost stories of Irish and African-American connections is a key part of Miriam Nyhan Grey’s work at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University. As part of an oral history project, she has completed 10 interviews to date with non-white Irish-Americans.Other academic research in the field is ongoing. Academic Christine Kinealy has written a book on 10 black abolitionists who visited Ireland around the same time as Frederick Douglass, the renowned African-American orator and former slave who visited Ireland in the 1840s, meeting key figures in Irish political life such as Daniel O’Connell.As America prepares to embrace Irish identity over the coming weeks, many hope that this new initiative can be a way of challenging the white homogeneity of Irish-America – to underline the fact that, like all national identities, Irishness is fluid, multidimensional and always in the process of being formed and refashioned.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Nigel Farage urges Republicans to donate to Bernie Sanders to boost Donald Trump\u0026#39s re-election hopesWomen must be guaranteed female-only lavatories in public buildings, says minister Children will be able to sue if rights aren\u0026#39t met under new Scottish Government proposalsComment: The real establishment ring is the one that gave credence to vile sex abuse liesCoronavirus: Outbreak could leave one in 10 people in the UK in hospitalGovernment\u0026#39s post-Brexit plan to let young EU migrants fill unskilled job vacanciesErdoğan is sorely testing the patience of the Nato alliance First suspected case of coronavirus spreading within UK borders\u0026#39Boris Bridge\u0026#39 and second phase of HS2 could be under threat after Heathrow rulingBattle-scarred Taliban commander welcomes peace deal after 18 years of warComment: Only global cooperation will stem the spread of coronavirusGig economy workers \u0026#39punished\u0026#39 by coronavirus self-isolation measuresMan who swallowed false teeth wins £200,000 damagesChildren of man convicted of terrorism offences to be assessed for radicalisationScotland Yard officers could be forced to relocate to Canada to protect Harry and MeghanCoronavirus latest news: First case of virus being passed on within the UK as infected tally hits 20Woman not told father had fatal disease loses fight for NHS payoutPatient gets heart implant that communicates with doctors on smartphonePressure grows on Italy to impose border controls as coronavirus spreadsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/28/TELEMMGLPICT000226329456_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqxXCI9Wh-V1PVtkHuRtXNlE4xpShTF_AG0qITHKkRWl4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dont blame young going strike blame adults indulging","story":"Environmental activist Greta Thunberg (centre) marches during a Youth Strike 4 Climate protest in Bristol today.How ironic. On a day when at least a dozen schools across Britain will be closed over fears of coronavirus, many headteachers and parents seem quite happy for children to be bussed en masse to Bristol to see Greta Thurnberg.The risk of catching the virus is too great, it seems, to carry out the humdrum business of teaching children in groups of 30 – but not too great for tens of thousands of kids to board (fossil fuel-powered) coaches and cram shoulder to shoulder in the centre of Bristol.Schools and parents need to get a grip on the YouthStrike4Climate movement. It is only two weeks since thousands of schoolchildren walked out in the last such strike – and I’m sure they would have done last week, too, had they not been on half term. We are reaching a situation where a four-day week in schools is going to become normal, with inevitable results for education.The otherwise relentless march of health and safety at schools seems to go out of the window when it comes to the climate strikes. Today’s gathering is going ahead in spite of warnings by the police that they will struggle to control the crowds because they have no idea how many people will turn out. They are worried about possible crush risks and of large numbers of children let loose in an unfamiliar city with no parental supervision.Yes, of course children have a right to protest and express themselves just like everyone else, but at the heart of the #YouthStrike movement is mass law-breaking. Children up to the ago of 16 are mandated to attend school, and yet increasing numbers seem to believe that they have the right to opt out whenever they feel like it – so long as they are representing some fashionable cause.I can understand why children should find it an exciting thing to, to bunk off school to go on a protest – I am sure I would have felt the same when I was their age. But it is disturbing that so many head teachers and parents seem happy to endorse this attitude.It is about time schools put their foot down and told their pupils: look, you’ve made your point. Skip school again and it will be counted as an unauthorised absence, with consequences for your future in the school. In the first instance, anyone taking a day off to join a protest will be put in detention and set an essay. I can suggest a good subject: “explain how Britain could conceivably reach the target demanded by the YouthStrike4Climate movement - total decarbonisation of the economy by 2030. Using what research materials you can, come up with a solution as to how we can decarbonise the steel industry and the cement industry, given that no technology yet exists to do this on a commercial scale. Explain what energy sources we should be using and how – if they are intermittent forms of energy like wind and solar – how we can store sufficient energy to overcome periods when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.”On previous occasions I have suggested this and been met with the response: “but they’re only kids”. Exactly, which is why they should be at school learning the reality of climate change and formidable engineering challenges we need to overcome to reach zero emissions.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

an administrative procedure similar to the royal prerogative - the agreement between the Prime Minister and Mr Cummings is a personal contract without the same legal standing. Another source said the pair came to the agreement at a private meeting in Downing Street the Sunday after Mr Johnson won the Tory leadership race on July 23, when he asked Mr Cummings to be his right-hand man.“Boris asked Dom to come in and offered him the job, and Dom said, these are the areas I want control over:  SpAds and personnel, and other key policy areas including the ARPA stuff, and I think some immigration policy and perhaps even reforming the civil service.”On Thursday, Downing Street launched a new open application process for SpAd roles to attract more recruits from the corporate and professional arena with experience of advising business leaders and other senior figures - and fewer Westminster lifers.According to a job ad placed on a new website Spadjobs.uk, Number 10 wants applicants with a track record of success working in communications or digital fields to apply to help effectively tackle long-term problems and take advantage of the opportunities Brexit has opened up.The recruitment drive came after Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor over a move to replace his SpAds with a team of aides controlled by Downing Street.Mr Javid launched a thinly veiled attack on Mr Cummings during his resignation speech to the Commons on Wednesday, when he appeared to lay the blame for his departure at the adviser’s door.Mr Javid’s resignation during the Feb 13 reshuffle followed rumours of tensions between Mr Javid and Mr Cummings, amid claims Number 10 feared the fiscally cautious Treasury was trying to rein in Mr Johnson’s ambitious spending plans.Mr Javid said: It has always been the case that advisers advise, ministers decide and ministers decide on their advisers.He added pointedly: I don’t intend to dwell further on all the details and the personalities … the \u0027comings\u0027 and goings if you will. But Mr Javid also claimed much of the commentary on his relationship with Mr Cummings was just gossip and distraction.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tweeted that Mr Javid had launched a damning attack on Mr Cummings\u0027 dominance of the Johnson administration.Mr Cummings has recently courted criticism over his hiring of Andrew Sabisky to shake up Whitehall. Mr Sabisky, a super forecaster adept at predicting future trends, was forced to resign after it emerged he had previously made controversial comments about race and eugenics.A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cummings has all the usual responsibility someone in his position has.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden touts obama ties plots comeback victory","story":"Addressing a college gym packed with supporters in Conway, South Carolina, Joe Biden reached for an anecdote on Thursday night. It involved his mother, Barack Obama and the US vice presidency.The year was 2008. Mr Obama was on his way to becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. He called Mr Biden, who ran in the same race but crashed out, and asked him to consider being his deputy. Mr Biden’s response was categorical - no. After decades in Washington he knew the jibes about the vice presidency being all hype and no power. But, arm twisted, he agreed to discuss it with his family for 48 hours. It was his mother’s words that struck home, Mr Biden told the audience. After 40 minutes sitting silently at the table she spoke up, listing everything her son had done to fight for civil rights as a youngster, including protesting segregation. “She looked at me, I swear to God, and said ‘Joey, the first black man in history has a chance to be elected president, he says he needs you ... and you told him no?” He swiftly changed his mind. The story was greeted with whoops and applause from the 600 people listening on in Conway. Something similar is happening right across this state, which on Saturday becomes the fourth to vote for the 2020 Democratic nominee. And it has a lot to do with Mr Obama. Mr Biden has had a woeful start to the race to take on Donald Trump. After leading in the polls for years he slumped to a fourth-place finish in Iowa, the first state to vote, earlier this month and followed it with a fifth in New Hampshire.The pundits declared him a dead man walking. But a second-place in Nevada started talk of a “comeback” and now Mr Biden is hoping for a full political rebirth in South Carolina. A win here could see him reclaim the mantle of leading moderate in the field. The latest polling average in South Carolina has Mr Biden miles ahead, on 34 per cent of the vote compared to Bernie Sanders in second place with 22 per cent. His backers say anything short of a double digit win would be disappointing - a sign of their confidence. Why the sudden turnaround? It is down to the make-up of the electorate as much as anything else. Some 60 per cent of people voting in the primary are expected to be African-American, a stark change to the overwhelmingly white early states. Which is where Mr Obama comes in. The former US president remains a hallowed figure in the Democratic Party, especially among black voters, and Mr Biden, his number two in the White House, is doing everything he can to play up their connection. In Conway, Mr Biden was introduced by Vivica A. Fox, the Hollywood star who once appeared in Independence Day. “He had Barack Obama’s back for eight years, right?” she said to the crowd. “Those two men worked hard to get our country back on track.”Once on stage, Mr Biden continued the theme. Mr Obama was “one of the finest men I ever knew”, he said. His granddaughter and Mr Obama\u0027s daughter are “best buddies”, he noted, going skiing together every year. Asked by one audience member if he would consider making Michelle Obama his vice presidential nominee, he shot back “in a heartbeat”, before adding she would not want the role.Mr Biden had used a similar tactic earlier in the day, when he addressed just a few dozen voters at a community health centre in McClellanville, a town of some 1,000 people in rural South Carolina. There, surrounded by trees with the southern sun beating down, Mr Biden used Mr Obama’s legacy to go after Mr Sanders, the democratic socialist senator who is riding high after getting most votes in all three early states. “I’m not trying to destroy Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation,” Mr Biden said. It was a pointed reference to Mr Sanders’s Medicare-for-all proposal, which would eradicate private insurance and put every American on government-funded plans instead. “What we can’t afford to do is tear it all down and start all over again”, Mr Biden warned. At other times this week he has said Mr Sanders wanted to challenge Mr Obama for the 2012 nomination, while also attacking his past opposition to tighter gun laws. The strategy appears to be paying off. Francis McPherson, an African-American pastor of the nearby Bethel Church who had been listening on, said he would vote for Mr Biden in part because of his ties to Mr Obama. “He’s not trying to destroy the former president’s agenda,” Mr McPherson, 74, told The Daily . “He’s going to build on that and go to another level. That’s what we need”. Mr McPherson stressed he does not tell his near 700-strong congregation how to vote but says he is supporting Mr Biden when asked. “They listen very closely to me and I believe they’re going to follow my leadership”, he added.Richard Thornton, an African-American veteran who fought in Vietnam, was still undecided after hearing the speech. He was frustrated with the bickering between Democratic rivals, fearing it would hand Mr Trump another term, but said he was leaning towards voting for Mr Biden.  All week Mr Biden has been announcing local endorsements, most notably Jim Clyburn, the highest ranked African-American in Congress. “I know his character, his heart, and his record,” Mr Clyburn said. Chants of We Know Joe have been ringing out at Biden events. Those endorsing Mr Biden in South Carolina believe he has a connection with black voters - one of the major blocks in the Democratic Party\u0027s support base - that will not only hand him this state but thrust him to the nomination.Jim Hodges, the only Democrat elected governor in the famously conservative state in the last 40 years, announced his support for Mr Biden a few weeks back and believes he can go all the way, despite the early stumbles. “There are no other candidates in the race who can match Biden in terms of connecting in a personal level with African-American voters,” Mr Hodges, who left office in 2003, told The Daily . “You’ve got various people offering ideas for the country but none of them have that personal connection that Biden does have from the Obama days.” He said Mr Sanders’s “political revolution” causes consternation to some Democrats in the Deep South. “We look at what happened in Britain with Jeremy Corbyn and it scares the hell out of the centre-left party that we might replicate it, he said. Mr Biden knows the stakes. He has spent all week on the ground in South Carolina, a state he has repeatedly and explicitly said he will top. Win here, win big, and Mr Biden is back, going into ‘Super Tuesday’, when 14 states vote in just three days\u0027 time, with the wind in his sails and Mr Sanders in his sights. But fall short and the chances of joining his old friend Mr Obama on the list of Oval Office occupants are all but gone. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"win against wokeness women have right female only lavatories","story":"Women look set to be guaranteed female-only lavatories in public buildings after an outcry over the trend towards gender-neutral facilities. Increasing numbers of publicly accessible lavatories - like those at The Old Vic theatre in London - are being converted into facilities that can be used by all.However, public authorities have a duty to provide safe spaces for women in the lavatories in their buildings, and making all facilities gender-neutral may fall foul of building regulations.Several peers complained this week that gender-neutral lavatories - which one Tory peer, Lord Lucas, said had been introduced by woke public bodies - made women feel uncomfortable.The Conservative hereditary peer called on the Government to explain the terms of the existing law better so managers of public buildings recognised they were able to make lavatories male or female only. Civil servants in the Department for Communities and Local Government have now been asked to write to the British Standards Committee to ask whether technical guidance on building regulations needs to be clarified to make it explicit that women must have access to female-only facilities.A Government source said: It is clear that there needs to be a public service provision for everyone in our community and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.The Government is committed to maintaining safeguards that protect women.Proper provision of separate toilets for both men and for women, which has long been a regulatory requirement, should be retained and improved. Speaking in the House of Lords, Lord Lucas said of the trend for gender-neutral lavatories: Women do not want to wash bloody underwear in front of men. What is the justification for making women feel unsafe, where now they feel safe?  Welcoming the rethink this weekend, Lord Lucas told The Daily : I am delighted that the Government is to make sure public buildings provide properly safe spaces for women.I hope they will also make sure that there are enough such spaces to meet demand - or at least to provide for women\u0027s needs equally with men’s.Raymond Boyd Martin, managing director of the British Toilet Association, added: Where space and planning allows, the BTA would always support the concept of separate facilities for females and males.The Old Vic was criticised when it converted all of its male and female lavatories to gender-neutral facilities last autumn. The number of toilets increased from 22 to 44, although 18 of them were urinals that could only be used by men.Sarah Ditum, a columnist for The Spectator magazine, said after the refurbishment: The Old Vic’s lavatories have gone from \u0027not enough\u0027 to \u0027none at all\u0027.Patrons are, in theory, free to \u0027self-select\u0027 from blocks labelled stalls-only and blocks containing urinals. The problem is obvious: women cannot use urinals.That means there are 44 toilets for men, but only 26 for women, and only that many for women who are willing to run the gauntlet of penis to get to the stalls alongside the urinals.So provision continues to favour men, but in some ways the situation is even worse than it was before because now men have free access to the only toilets that women can use.She added: A theatre with inadequate women’s toilets, or without women’s toilets at all, is a theatre that doesn’t care whether there are women in its audience.The Old Vic said last October that four out of five visitors either agreed or neither agreed nor disagreed with the redesignation of its lavatories as gender-neutral facilities.It also said 23 of the lavatories are contained within units that contain only cubicled loos in addition to one gender-neutral loo (with enclosed sink) and two wheelchair-accessible loos (with enclosed sink).More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/27/17/correction-0.jpg","title":"stock market correction coronavirus meaning definition sp 500 stoxx 600","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.What does a correction actually mean?

The UK\u0027s blue-chip index of large companies briefly touched a three-and-a-half year low, before rallying to partially recoup\u0026nbspsome of the day\u0027s losses.Among the biggest fallers was International Airlines Group (IAG), the owner of\u0026nbspBritish Airways,\u0026nbspwhich saw its shares tank after warning that the Covid-19\u0026nbspvirus\u0026nbsphad caused a drop in demand for flights. The carrier has now lost more than a quarter of its value in less than 10 days.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesStock markets in Asia also plunged further on Friday after Wall Street registered its biggest single-day fall in nine years.In Tokyo, the Nikkei plummeted 3.7 per cent, while\u0026nbspmarkets in Seoul and Sydney dropped by more than 3 per cent, and\u0026nbspHong Kong and Shanghai sank by more than 2.5 per cent.Created with Sketch.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only other similar object was spotted in 2006 and has since left its orbit around the Earth.Earth has a new ‘minimoon’, scientists announceThe newly discovered satellite will also leave Earth’s orbit, in the coming months, leaving\u0026nbspastronomers scrambling to get images of the object and understand its origin.“Obtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth. It is expected to be ejected from Earth’s orbit altogether in April,” said John Blakeslee, head of science at the international Gemini Observatory, which was responsible for the new images.In the picture, the object can be seen glowing at the centre, with stars streaking across because the telescope was moving to track the object as it moved around the Earth.The image was taken on 24 February, soon after\u0026nbsp2020\u0026nbspCD3 was first spotted.Astronomers hope to get more images of the object, in an attempt to learn more about it.They will look in particular to understand how bright it is shining and how much light it reflects – if it is especially dim, then it is likely to be a rocky body, but if it is shining brighter it is more likely to be a reflective piece of debris, such as a used rocket booster.“Additional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object’s orbit and its possible origin,” he said.Astronomers expect to find many more such objects as new ways of observing them come online.The Gemini Observatory is part of the\u0026nbspNSF’s\u0026nbspNational Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, which is currently preparing the\u0026nbspVera C\u0026nbspRubin Observatory, which will scan the sky of seeing yet more similar objects.“We expect to find a population of these objects once the Rubin Observatory is operational,” said Mr Fedorets\u0026nbspin a statement. “Stay tuned!”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m drama by association. I put myself out there with my peers I don’t know if people really ever wanted to do the same with me. So I stopped wasting my energy.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the interview, Halsey also discussed her public split with rapper G-Eazy, with whom she recorded the 2017 duet “Him \u0026amp I”.Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb.

She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past.

This means it can easily go under the radar.It was unsurprising to see a case of human-to-human transmission in the UK, said senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, Dr Michael Head.He added: There will be significant efforts to look at how this patient came to be infected, who is the index case in the UK and to see if any there are any other secondary cases. Though this is a notable development here in the UK, the overall risks to the public right now remain unchanged.North Korea holds meeting to discuss \u0027anti-epidemic\u0027 stepsKim Jong Un\u0026nbspheld a meeting of the ruling Workers\u0027 Party\u0027s politburo to discuss anti-epidemics steps to prevent the spread of the virus, state news agency KCNA has said.In a rare public outing amid efforts to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus in the isolated country, he\u0026nbspalso oversaw military drills on Friday, KCNA said.There are fears that were the virus to reach North Korea, the authoritarian country would lack sufficient\u0026nbsphealth infrastructure to halt its spread.Death toll in Iran far higher than official count, sources warnSources in Iran\u0027s health system have told BBC Persian that at least 210 people have died from the coronavirus - six times the number announced by the government.Kianoush Jahanpour, a government spokesperson said the official figure was accurate and honest,\u0026nbspand accused the broadcaster of spreading lies.El Salvador\u0027s president has announced it will bar travellers from Iran from entering the country in order to curb the virus\u0027 spread.Iran is now home to a dire outbreak, with the government\u0026nbspdisputing a death toll that some anonymous health officials\u0026nbspwarn could sit above 200, according to BBC Persian.US politicians advised to make alternative work arrangements in case of outbreakMembers of the House of Representatives have been\u0026nbspadvised to establish plans for alternative work arrangements in case the coronavirus becomes widespread in the US.Although we do not have current indications of widespread infections in the United States, your office should consider continuity of operations (COOP) planning in the event of a widespread outbreak, House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving wrote to politicians.This could include telework arrangements for congressional staff, according to a separate communication from the House Administration Committee.\u0027Drive-through\u0027 testing centres introduced in ScotlandSome patients with an appointment are being tested for coronavirus in their cars at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.This service is for patients who have been assessed by the specialist team so it is an appointment-only service, said NHS Lothian medical director Dr Tracey Gillies.It is not a drop-in clinic and it is important to stress that patients cannot be seen without an appointment. The drive-through facility and the community testing teams allow us to test patients without them coming into healthcare facilities.Patients will be referred on by their GP or NHS 24 if they are at risk of the virus and meet the clinical criteria.They will then be referred on to our teams, who will decide whether they need to be tested in their own homes or if they are well enough and can use their own transport to drive to the Western General Hospital.Imminent community transmission in UK \u0027highly likely,\u0027 government saysThe UK\u0027s\u0026nbsplatest coronavirus case may be the first with no link to overseas travel.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has said\u0026nbspthe virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus was unclear. It added that there was no immediately identifiable link to overseas travel.The virus was passed on in the UK but the original source of the virus is unclear at this stage, the DHSC said.We do not currently have complete understanding of the chain of transmission in this case, but there is no immediately identifiable link to overseas travel.\u0026nbspGiven the recent increases in international case numbers, especially Europe, it is highly likely that we will soon see some instances of community transmission in the UK.New coronavirus patient is\u0026nbspSurrey residentThe latest UK coronavirus patient is a resident in Surrey,\u0026nbspPublic Health England (PHE) has said.Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19, said Dr Alison Barnett, centre director for PHE South East.One of the latest cases is a resident of Surrey and we\u0027re working closely with NHS colleagues in that area as well as Surrey County Council to manage the situation and help reduce the risk of further cases.Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case.This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.Breaking: New case confirmed in England and patient contracted virus in UK\u0026nbspOne further patient in England has tested positive for Covid-19, the England\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty told reporters. The virus was passed on in the UK.It is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an inidual who had recently returned from abroad.This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy\u0027s and St Thomas\u0027.The total number of cases in England is now 18. Following confirmed cases in Northern Ireland and Wales, the total number of UK cases is 20.Schools to remain closed as France announces 19 new casesThe health minister announced some schools would remain closed in the Oise region beyond the end of the holidays, as the known number of national cases rose to 57.Olivier Véran said several coronavirus clusters had been identified, and that the virus was now spreading on French soil.He warned people not to shake hands in order to halt the virus\u0027s spread.Amazon orders employees to defer all non-essential travelThe world\u0027s largest online retailer significantly escalated its efforts to combat the outbreak,\u0026nbspsaying all employees should avoid non-essential travel, including within the US.Previously it had said it was putting travel restrictions to China in place. With this broader halt of employee work trips, it was not immediately clear how the company distinguished essential from non-essential travel.Amazon\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide operations, Dave Clark, notified employees of the change on Thursday, which Amazon confirmed to Reuters.When asked if the government should have repatriated people from the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess sooner, Mr Johnson said it had been following the best medical advice.He said:\u0026nbspWe very much regret the loss of life of the inidual concerned but we think that the best thing to do is not to move people around too much in the current situation.\u0026nbspNot to repatriate unless you can be absolutely sure there is not going to be a spread or contagion to this country, so that\u0027s the principle we are adopting.Mr Johnson said people were right to be concerned about the virus but the best thing they could do was regularly wash their hands with soap and water.He added: I just really want to repeat the advice of the chief medical officers, which I think is the best thing to get across - the most valuable thing we can all do to prevent the spread of the coronavirus is to wash our hands for 20 seconds or more with hot water and soap.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s the best single piece of advice we can give.\u0026nbspI think people are right to be concerned and they are right to want to take every possible precaution, and we will in the course of the next few days be issuing further advice about how to respond and how we will be deal with any potential outbreak.Boris Johnson says coronavirus is government\u0027s top priorityBoris Johnson has said the coronavirus outbreak is now the government\u0027s top priority.\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0026nbspsaid he had met with the health secretary and chief medical officers to discuss the preparations.He said: On the issue of coronavirus, which obviously is a great concern to people, I just want to reassure everybody and say that the NHS is making every possible preparation.As you can imagine, the issue of coronavirus is something that is now the government\u0027s top priority.I have just had a meeting with the chief medical officer and secretary of state for health talking about the preparations that we need to make.Iran\u0027s health ministry spokesman has tweeted to reject\u0026nbspa report by BBC Persian that at least 210 people have died from coronavirus in the country.\u0026nbspThe spokesman, Kianush jahanpur, announced earlier in the day that 34 people have died from coronavirus in Iran so far.Coronavirus plan could see London\u0027s Hyde Park become a morgue“We have contingency plans to open up a morgue in Hyde Park, in tents,” Nickie Aiken, an MP\u0026nbspwhose constituency includes the park, told Bloomberg.“We would run the morgue for most of central London.”She added:\u0026nbsp“I was on the Tube yesterday going to the City, and I was thinking this is a nightmare.In the worst-case scenario, it’s going to be horrendous.”At least 210 have died from coronavirus in Iran, BBC reportsAt least 210 people have died from coronavirus in various cities in Iran as of Thursday night, BBC Persian reported, citing hospital sources.It came the same day as an Iranian health ministry spokesman said\u0026nbsp34 people have died in Iran of coronavirus so far and 388 are infected.Italian coronavirus deaths rise to 21Four more people have died in Italy from coronavirus, the civil protection agency said on Friday, bringing the total to 21.The number testing positive for the illness jumped to 821 from 650 on Thursday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises.

Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.

The swimmer, who won 200m gold in Rio, as well as 400m and 1,500m freestyle golds in London, subsequently asked CAS for a public trial.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSun\u0027s fellow swimmers reacted angrily after FINA initially cleared him of any wrongdoing, with Britain\u0027s Duncan Scott refusing to shake his hand on the podium at the world championships last year in Gwangju. Sun responded to the snub by firing back: “You’re a loser, I’m a winner”.The 10-hour CAS hearing was broadcasted on the court\u0027s website showed Sun to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. The CAS panel\u0027s verdict was delayed until all parties got a verified translation.The 6-foot, 7-inch (2-meter) Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win Olympic gold, has long been a polarizing figure in the pool. Rivals branded him a drug cheat at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and two competitors refused to stand with him on medal podiums at the 2019 world championships.Now banned until February 2028, the 28-year-old Sun cannot defend his 200-meter freestyle title in Tokyo.The World Anti-Doping Agency went to CAS after a FINA tribunal only warned Sun. The first ruling was that anti-doping protocol was not followed, making the samples invalid, and cited doubts about credentials shown to him by the sample collection team.WADA requested a ban of between two and eight years for a second doping conviction.Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 imposed by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a stimulant that was banned at the time. The ban was not announced until after it ended and he never missed a major event.That first case led to criticism of FINA for appearing to protect one of the sport\u0027s biggest stars in a key market.Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailFiveThirtyEight predicts Mr Sanders has the best chance to win the state. He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize. California, the country’s most populous state, has 415 pledged delegates and 79 superdelegates up for grabs.California’s Democratic voters are 50 per cent white, 26 per cent Hiic, 15 per cent Asian, eight per cent black and one percent other races.\u0026nbspCensus information from 2016 shows that 17 percent of the state is over the age of 65, just under the national average of 19 percent. The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates. Every other candidate is at risk of falling under the 15 per cent viability threshold. The closest runner up, Mr Biden, is only expected to win an average of 17 percent of the vote and an average of 83 delegates. Mr Sanders and Mr Biden are the only candidates whose predicted averages exceed the 15 percent viability threshold.\u0026nbspThe Centennial State has 67 pledged delegates on the line and nine superdelegates.Colorado’s Democratic voters are 75 per cent white, 15 per cent Hiic, six per cent black, and four per cent Asian and other races.Census data from 2016 shows that the state has a population of iniduals 65-year-old and over that is 2.4 percent lower than the national average of 18.9 per cent. The state’s median household income is $61,303, $7,676 more than the national average. The state’s poverty rate is 2.6 per cent lower than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts Mr Sanders will win Colorado with 31 per cent of the vote and earn an average of 35 delegates.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMaine has 24 pledged delegates with three PLEO delegates available to win.\u0026nbspThe state’s Democratic voter demographic makeup is 95 per cent white, one percent black, one per cent Hiic and two per cent Asian and other races.\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts that Mr Sanders has a 67 per cent chance to win the state.

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It. Now.The latest salvo was fired by Gwyneth Paltrow, who hosted a “natural” dinner party to promote her well-being website Goop and invited, among others, Demi Moore and Kate Hudson.Demi, who has spent £squillion on cosmetic surgery, looked great. As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say.

Of course, they could also just have a cold.But nevertheless traders, exploration and refining unit staff were told to work remotely – something that is not possible in many businesses.Some folk are being asked to self-quarantine for two weeks simply because they went on holiday to northern Italy.It’s getting even more needlessly dramatic within education.As it stands, Public Health England are NOT advising any schools to close.But eight now have been, while another  have quarantined pupils, forcing them to stay at home with their parents for a fortnight.In the most ridiculous case so far, an Essex primary school has been shut by its headmaster because one of its teachers spent half-term in Italy. That teacher is reportedly not sick or exhibiting any of the symptoms of coronavirus.We’ve already seen the very real cost to the market of such overreach, with £ billion wiped off the FTSE  in just  hours and the shares of travel companies like Tui and Easy Jet plummeting.The government is right and responsible to consider worst-case scenarios and plan appropriately.The Sun today revealed details of an official report showing that a catastrophic outbreak could see  per cent of Brits come down with coronavirus and , die.Of the  people tested for the virus in the UK,  have tested positive and eight of those have now been discharged.The reality is that for the vast majority of healthy people Coronavirus will not be fatal.Doing the basics right now – like washing your hands regularly and using tissues – will actually do more to help curb the spread than costly grand gestures.We must be vigilant and safe, but avoid Coronavirus hysteria.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And from the reaction we saw the people think the same, too.Good luck on this adventure in America and Canada — but I don’t think it will be long before he misses this country so much that he will want to come back and become a fully fledged member of the Royal Family.I hope his self-imposed exile is short-lived, but at the moment he is doing what his we wants and that is commendable.

As far as the nation is concerned he is still their number one member of the Royal Family.Harry is one of those instinctive people who do and say the first thing that comes into their head and when I saw him hugging people in Edinburgh I remembered why the public will always love him.Just before Christmas, when he visited a school in Luton, the students were queuing up to give him a hug before he left. That’s the Harry I know and love. We will miss him.Having toured with Harry for many years, he was a photographer’s dream — even when the tables were turned on me.In a youth club in New Zealand he was asked to put his painted hand on the wall, which he did.And then he rushed across the room and planted it on my head, as you see in the picture above.When we washed up afterwards he rebuked me for telling the whole nation on TV that morning he was going bald — just like his dad.I know his father, Prince Charles, is upset that his son is leaving and William, his best friend for many years, will also be sad to see his brother go.But the Queen has given him a year to review it and he will be welcomed like the prodigal sonhe decides his future is here back in Britain in the world’s number one family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the end of the last decade, men could expect to live . years and women were still well ahead on ..But in my patch, the North East of England, le expectancy for women has actually fallen a little.The report comes from a bloke called Sir Michael Marmot. He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game. He has been arguing for decades about social inequality and its effects upon health.Fair enough. But this has given rise to headlines about evil Tories killing people. The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks. And cackling maniacally.But is it really quite so simple as that  Is it really all about poverty Sir Michael admits that  per cent might be attributable to new flu strains which have arrived here as a consequence of increased globalisation.Bird flu, Sars and now the coronavirus.That’s not all, though. As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere. Simply that there are a few more factors to take into account before we blame the Tories, once again, for killing people.The bloke had just got back from Iran, where the virus has been spreading. The experts have been warning of a possible , deaths in the UK. We need to remember that is a very-worst-case scenario based upon a lot of “s”.But just to be on the safe side, shouldn’t we be carrying out compulsory checks on all visitors flying in from flu-stricken areas Instead of allowing people to “self-report” IN the coffee plantations of Guatemala, Central America, kids lug sacks of coffee beans around for eight hours a day.For this they are paid the princely sum of £.

Well, I’d decided to give up donating to charities for a month or so. But happy to make a very noble exception. Never before in our democratic country has free speech been so under threat.It’s OK for gobby old tossers like Toby and me – we have a  to speak. But too often people are hounded from their jobs simply for expressing an opinion.

It was actually made in Kettering, Northants.Anyway, I had a bowl of the stuff and couldn’t work out why it wasn’t as nice as I remembered.My Facebook friends told me it was because they’ve cut the sugar content. Probably that’s right.But isn’t it also that NOTHING tastes as good as how you remember it  Not Alpen, not Mars bars, not Monster Munch.And definitely not Heinz Sandwich Spread, which tastes to me these days like paint stripper.Have to say, the site seems to me to be run as a kind of grooming parlour for the benefit of middle-aged pervs. But it’s not just that. The longer your kids – and especially the girls – spend online, the greater their chances of developing depression and other mental illnesses.They also end up with a much shorter attention span.

China, South Korea and northern Italy.Some  Britons remain stuck in Tenere after at least four hotel guests were diagnosed with COVID-.Jet has taken a strong stance against flying the travellers home, telling customers they can instead remain at the four-star H Costa Adeje Palace hotel for the whole of a two-week quarantine period.If they test negative after the two week isolation, Jet will then allow them to fly home on one of its planes.The Minister of Health in Tenere said around  guests from  dferent countries would be able to leave the hotelthey arrived on Monday, after infected guests had already left.Its understood about  of those guests are Brits, however Jet is going against the Minister’s advice and refusing to fly anyone home.Jet said: We have asked all customers to remain in the hotel, which remains under quarantine.”We will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have

local hospital in Candelaria.The development comes after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Northern Ireland, as two further patients have been diagnosed in England.That patient had travelled from northern Italy via Dublin.It means  people have tested positive in the UK since the virus outbreak began in China in December.Experts have warned of school closures and the cancellation

statement said: As the Duke and Duchess are currently recognised as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as-needed basis, the government statement said.The assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status.It comes as it was revealed that Harry and Meghan will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son from the politan Police.In a statement on their website the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son which should fall on the UK taxpayer based on the Dukes public profile by virtue of being born a royal, his military service, the Duchesss independent profile.Police fear resources will be stretched while protecting the couple who experts believe could make £bn following their split from the royal family.Senior officers are understood to be drafting emergency plans to double the ­British protection team guarding the family.Former Met protection officer Dai Davies said: In their current state the plans are unworkable.Harry and Meghan’s ­situation has called for a complete ripping up of the ­rulebook and they are acting like none of the rules apply to them.There is already a severe lack of trained officers and this is only adding to the Mets woes.Scotland Yard refused to comment when contacted by the Sun Online.A spokesman for the Sussexes said: Buckingham Palace does not comment on the details of security arrangement.There are well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security.Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, estimates the couple are on course to triple the £million net worth of the Beckhams.After probing Harry and Meghans financial background, Mr Watts said: You cant underestimate the international appeal of being a Royal.And the appeal is even bigger in the US, Canada and the rest of the world.I think it’s possible that in ten years’ time, Prince Harry and Meghan could make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List with £m and £bn in the longer term.In their first joint UK event since their bombshell decision

The one that is far more biased, out of control and in need of immediate reform.But this week we were provided with a happy reminder that Channel ’s future is by no means certain.MPs close to the Prime Minister revealed a plan is on the table for the blatantly left-wing broadcaster to be privatised.That will be music to the ears of fair-minded folk everywhere who have seen the once-interesting and innovative station morph into a liberal propaganda network that believes it is there to humiliate the Tories and call out commercial media rivals.It’s a shocking anomaly that in the  broadcasting world, where choice for consumers is at an all-time high, C is publicly owned at all.The sort of quirky, culturally relevant, groundbreaking and erse programming that once made the channel worth having is a distant memory.Instead, we are left in the truly odd situation where one Government-owned broadcasterspent many millions of pounds to poach from another BBC a genuinely popular existing programme called The Great British Bake Off, with the result being the show’s biggest stars leaving and the ratings halving.Meanwhile, C’s lone recent success, Black Mirror, was lost to Netflix.Then there’s the sorry state of Channel  News, which makes even Newsnight look impartial.It was no surprise to me when I witnessed at the Bafta Awards last month Hugh Grant make a beeline for his pal Jon “F*** the Tories” Snow, no doubt to collude on even more coverage designed to undermine anyone who doesn’t share their anti-Press, anti-Brexit world view.Let me remind you of just a small portion of the smorgasbord of hit pieces served up by C in the past year alone.There was the “comedy” that imagined a character, based on Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, was shot in the head while giving a speech about immigration.There was the real speech from the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, where she attacked Boris Johnson as a “known liar”.Its news service then ly claimed the PM said “people of colour” while answering a question about democratically controlled immigration rather than “people of talent”.There was the climate change debate where C News replaced Boris with a chunk of melting ice and refused to let his stand-in Michael Gove into the venue to represent the Tories.And there was the most recent election night broadcast where a studio audience who they claimed fairly represented the political spectrum booed when the exit poll showing a massive Tory majority was announced.If any other channel had broadcast such slanted programming they would have faced sanctions from the regulator Ofcom many times over.There is literally no benefit for the Government to hang on to a broadcaster which has lost any sense of its real reason for being.C no longer provides any sort of public service broadcasting.To be completely honest, barring the odd gem, it hasn’t done since it became Big Brother TV in  and started a march towards hyper-commercialism.I am by no means saying C should not exist. Once privatised, the successful parts would be able to thrive.That would mean far more commercially viable hits like the soap Hollyoaks, and further series of popular factual series like Bake Off.And likely the end of a biased news service fronted by Mr Snow, that on Wednesday night saw its ratings plummet to just ,.HOLLYWOOD celebrity agents and PRs operate in a narcissistic system where the over-the-top needs and desires of their spoiled, A-list, millionaire clients are put above everything .There is not a moment to think of the greater good for humanity, nor even the other staff involved on a project.No constraints are placed on the ridiculous nature of the daily requests these staff members oversee, be it demands for millions of dollars more for a project, or a private jet, or three personal assistants.They know all too well thattheir famous client isn’t happy, there is a long list of other agents just waiting to step in to take their -per-cent cut of the star’s earnings.That’s why, for the past six months, there has been a growing sense of dread within the Royal Family about such a network of Hollywood vultures becoming intrinsically involved in the “business” of the monarchy.And there was most definitely reason to worry.As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s classless rebuke to the Queen over the use of the word “royal” showed, their new team will go for the low blow without a second thought for the damage it could cause to Crown or country.FOR years I have been campaigning for the BBC to overhaul the system that sees us put up a God-awful entry for the Eurovision Song Contest year after year.Sure, I acknowledge that we’re never going to do particularly well in the actual results, especially post-Brexit.But that’s no reason to put forward the type of total dross we have been.So this year I am celebrating – because the UK entry is actually an immediate piece of mid-tempo pop magic with a soaring chorus.Sensibly, the Beeb has signed up talented singer-songwriter James Newman to represent us with his tune My Last Breath.His record company BMG says it started the search for a song with the “sole aim of changing the perception of the contest by working with the very best UK songwriters”.James certainly has Eurovision pedigree.He won a Brit in  as co-writer of Rudimental hit Waiting All Night, has twice been nominated for Grammys and has written hit singles for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Jess Glynne.And his brother is the equally talented pop star John Newman.But now is his time to step into the spotlight himself and be able to proudly fly the Union Jack in Rotterdam this May.You can tune into Dan’s talkRADIO Drivetime slot on weekdays between pm and pm Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We had our heart set on this place, we thought this would be our family home.Amy’s bank said because she had willingly transferred the money it is unlikely she will get the money back.The owner of the house Frank Ballinger, , has lived in the property in Brackla for around  years.The retired special constable who had worked for the South Wales Police said: The couple came here one afternoon and they said that they were here to look at the house.I was confused at first, I said to them are you sure its not the number across the road as theres a couple of houses up for rent in the street.They were adamant that it was this house. I was just confused as to what was going on as I knew that I hadnt put this house up for sale.I just told them that this house belongs to me.

The majority are begrudgingly fine with it, seeing it as part of the well-paid territory. Occasionally they message you to say you’re now dead to them but it’s very rare for anyone to set their lawyers on to you. However, that’s what David Steel did in , demanding a retraction and payment of costs for writing that the former Liberal leader knew of ­allegations that Cyril Smith had abused boys but did nothing, ­eventually nominating him for a knighthood. The basis for allegations against Smith came from a magazine article, researched in Rochdale, which said the MP had inveigled himself into a ­children’s hostel where he stripped, spanked and fondled the genitals of boys.  But Steel’s lawyers were adamant that my take on events was wrong, and with no other evidence, the Mirror ran this retraction: “Brian Reade stated that David Steel, as he then was, had known of ­allegations that Cyril Smith was ­serially abusing boys, but had done nothing about it. Lord Steel has asked us to point out that he received no complaint against Mr Smith’s activities when a Liberal MP. He was aware from an article in  of allegations against Cyril Smith of unusual behaviour with boys from the first half of the s. He questioned Mr Smith about those ­allegations. Mr Smith denied any wrongdoing and saidthat the matter had already been investigated by the police who had closed their file.” Well, it turns out it’s Steel who owes us at least an apology, after admitting to a sex abuse inquiry that when he confronted Smith about the ­allegations in  he “assumed” them to be true, yet did nothing because the allegations were made before Smith became a Liberal MP. According to some of Smith’s  alleged victims, he carried on abusing boys as young as eight throughout the s. Yet in  Steel recommended him for a knighthood without askinghe was still an abuser. This week the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse issued a damning verdict on Steel, saying he “abdicated his ­responsibility” to act over Smith, viewed him “through the lens of ­political expediency” and was “completely unrepentant” about his inaction.

The cam footage was taken on the A, between Cambridge and Coventry. Meanwhile, , mattresses – as high as  Empire State buildingsstacked up – were illegally dumped in England last year. Councils want mattress manufacturers to be forced to recycle their products and offer take-back services. The Local Government Association said fly-tipping is costing taxpayers £million a year to clear up the mess left on roadsides and in public areas. An LGA analysis of industry figures showed annual UK mattress sales of . million, but with only . million recycled. LGA environment spokesman David Renard said: Dumped mattresses made up a quarter of all fly-tipping incidents in some areas in the past five years. Unwanted mattresses are fuelling landfill costs which continue to rise, putting pressure on waste and recycling centres which councils are working hard to keep open.

As the virus continues to spread rapidly across the planet, the number of Covid- patients diagnosed in the UK slowly ticks upwards. This morning the Department of Health and Social Care announced that two Brits had contracted the virus while in Iran. Both have ed to London from the Middle Eastern country, which has had the highest number of deaths outside of China. The London patients are being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in the capital, where a number of infected people are also in quarantine. Someone from Swansea in Wales also has the disease following a trip to Northern Italy. Public Health Wales is working to identy those who have come into contact with the patient.  Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at the organisation, said: Public Health Wales is working hard to identy close contacts, and we are taking all appropriate actions to reduce any risk to the publicaposs health. The ages and genders of the newly confirmed patients have not been revealed by the authorities. Yesterday six more people tested positive for Cornavirus in the UK.The highest concentration of patients is to be found in London, where five have been quarantined after flying in from France, one from China, one from Italy and two from Iran. A Chinese student and their mum were diagnosed and quarantined in York, while Derbsyhire has one confirmed patient who spent time out in Tenere. Four people have been isolated at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside having left the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship which became a hotbed for the virus.  Both Belfast and Cardf have a confirmed case each which originated in Italy. In the past day concerns have been raised about the NHSaposs ability to cope with the spread of the virus. It emerged last night that overstretched hospitals here in the UK would be forced to treat only the patients most likely to survive should the virus take hold. Former Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said: “The NHS would find it hard to copethe pandemic took off.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent four hours visiting Kettering Hospital during the night sht on Thursday night."},{"url":null,"title":"first clip prince harry jon","story":"NewsFirst clip of Prince Harry and Jon Bon Jovis charity song - with disappointing newsPrince Harry spent the morning at Abbey Road Studios with Jon Bon Jovi recording a new version of his hit Unbroken in aid of the Invictus Games FoundationShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video first-clip-prince-harry-jon-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news first-clip-prince-harry-jon-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Thousands of young pupils took the day off school to see the Swedish teenager, , address a rally on College Green as part of a Youth Strike  Climate protest. The prominent campaigner walked on stage to chants of Greta, Greta from the crowd, estimated to total , by organisers. Wearing a white knitted hat and yellow raincoat, she said the climate emergency is being completely ignored by politicians and the media. Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautul words and promises from our elected officials, she continued.  I will not be silenced while the world is on fire - will you  Youngsters braved the rain to gather in the city centre ahead of Thunbergaposs arrival, holding placards with slogans saying Iaposm less of a baby than Boris and at this point education is pointless. Another read: when our world is dead where do we go  Ending her speech, Thunberg said: We will not be silenced because we are the change. And change is coming whether you like it or not. Thank you and letaposs march.The speech is due to be followed by a march through Bristol. I look up to Greta Thunberg and I want to show my respect, said protester Eve Nott, , from nearby Bath. I think she can help us in changing our ways. Speaking to Bristol Live as she arrived by train at Temple Meads Station, Thunberg said she chose to come to the city due to its strong environmental movement. She said she hoped the event would be a gathering of people standing together in solidarity.  Speaking before Thunberg addressed the crowd, Mya-Rose Craig, also , called for change. Mya-Rose was the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol last week. The student called for greater ersity in the climate movement. She told the crowd: Greta, welcome to our amazing city and thank you for being with us today. We have to engage with all of our communities in order to properly fight climate change. An unequal world can never be a sustainable one.It comes after police raised safety fears over the numbers planning to attend the environmental protest from across the country. Parents, especially those with primary school aged children, have been told to be aware of the risks of falls and crushing. Saying a lack of information from organisers has made it dficult to make adequate preparations, Bristol City Council and Avon and Somerset Police warned: Do not underestimate the scale of this protest. Residents have been urged to avoid unnecessary travel, with many busy roads in the centre closed to accommodate the rally from am to .pm.Two schools are also closed today. But others have embraced the event, with the Old Vic Theatre in King Street opening its facilities to youngsters and their families - offering them use of loos, baby changing units and a place to take shelter from the rain. There will be major disruption to the city, the councilaposs executive director, Mike Jackson, and Superintendent Andy Bennett of Bristol Police said, asking parents to be responsible for their children.  Parents are responsible for their children. The council and police are not responsible for unsupervised children. In terms of big crowds, there is the potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing. People can easily be separated from their friends and family. Mobile phone signals can be intermittent due to saturation on the communications masts.  However Bristol Youth Strike  Climate - which organised the demo - says they have no time for being patronised by police. In a social media post, they say safety measures have been put in place, including  metres of festival barriers, a safe zone at the front for young children and more than  stewards. The worldaposs youth are waking up and taking action on the climate crisis, they continued.

There has been a steady stream of arrivals at the Holiday Inn, which was block-booked under coronavirus contingency measures. Those being taken to the four-star hotel near the airport are visitors to the UK who may have been exposed to Covid- in hot spots such as China, Iran or north Italy. A man living near the hotel said: “It’s concerning to see all this activity. We have three children. “We’d like to know more about why these ambulances are coming into the hotel. We have seen eight in the last two days. They should be giving us more information.” Unlike Britons who have gone into self-isolation in their homes after visiting hot spots, these tourists or business visitors are unlikely to have anywhere  to go. There has been no confirmation about anyone at the hotel having coronavirus symptoms. Vehicles have to pass through a temporary ft-high barrier installed around the hotel grounds.  As ambulances arrive, security guards in face masks can be seen behind the barrier. A van owned by Stericycle, a company specialising in biohazard waste disposal, has been spotted entering the hotel property. Stericycle is working with the NHS to ensure no waste contaminated with coronavirus escapes into the wider environment.  A statement on its website says: “To mitigate risk associated with managing waste contaminated with -CoV, Stericycle has developed a dedicated procedure for the management of this waste.” Delivery lorries thought to be containing catering and cleaning supplies have also arrived. Last night the IHG hotel group, which owns the hotel chain, confirmed the Department of Health has reserved Holiday Inn London – Heathrow Ariel for at least a month. Any other guests who had booked have been relocated to other IHG hotels in the area. Access routes into the hotel have been coned off.  It is near the airport in Hillingdon. The Holiday Inn quarantine site is the first in the capital. The Department of Health said it would not release details of any activity at the hotel. Hundreds of Brits on evacuation flights out of the coronavirus epicentre in Wuhan, China, were the first to be placed in quarantine.  Most were taken to an NHS accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral. Other evacuees were driven from RAF bases to a hotel and conference centre in Milton Keynes, Bucks. Last week  Brits who had been on the virus-hit Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were repatriated and taken to the Wirral base. Four tested positive for the virus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged anyone ing from towns in northern Italy to self-isolate for  daysthey get flu-like symptoms. Four schools in England have shut for a “deep clean” after pupils ed from skiing trips. British company PPS, which manufactures medical isolation pods, says staff have been rushed off their feet dealing with orders from around the world.

Two men and a -year-old girl from Vietnam were found crammed inside the tiny compartment on top of HGV driver Robert Rooney’s Ford Focus. A court heard how Rooney, , told officials in the UK controlled zone at the Channel Tunnel in Coquelles, France, the box had “camping stuff” inside. But when Border Force officers opened it, the first thing they saw was a “human arm”. Harrowing pictures show the migrants inside the roof box, which is not much bigger than a suitcase. Prosecutor Bridget Todd told Canterbury crown court the box was, “an airtight concealment”, adding: “There was no attempt to put any ventilation in the box. “Should the box have become detached on the motorway, the result would have been catastrophic.” She added that the dad-of-three had “clearly intended to gain financially” in the smuggling attempt. Rooney, originally from Ireland, had admitted facilitating illegal entry at an earlier hearing. His defence barrister James Burke said his client had been “struggling financially with overdrafts and loans”.  He added: “He succumbed to the temptation of a solution to these problems.” Jailing him for three years today, Judge Catherine Brown said: “These were people who were strangers to you. “It was a high-risk venture given the very cramped conditions. “There would have been no ventilation for them. If there had been a delay in crossing, this could very well have had tragic consequences.

Multiple severe weather warnings are in place from now until Tuesday covering the whole of the UK - with as many as nine separate Met Office yellow warnings in place for Saturday alone. Storm Jorge will track across the north-west of the UK over the weekend and we can expect some terrible downpours overnight tonight bringing the possibility of flooding and a danger to le from fast flowing or deep floodwater. Not to mention the carnage which will ensue on public transport.Chief meteorologist at the Met Office, Frank Saunders, said: “For the rest of today- and ahead of Storm Jorge’s arrival - there are warnings for rain and snow.The heaviest snowfall – with accumulations of - cm on higher routes – is likely to occur across central Scotland, where snow may fall to lower levels for a time. “From Saturday Storm Jorge will bring strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the UK, with potentially heavy snowfall being a hazard for parts of Scotland.Areas above  metres could see accumulations of - cm of snow, with lower areas - roughly above  metres - seeing accumulations of up to  cm. On Saturday and Sunday, the majority of the UK is covered by Yellow weather warnings with some areas being covered by more than one warning, indicating multiple weather hazards.  The chief forecaster at the West Country-based Met Office warned that Wales could be drowned in as much as mm of rainfall and the UK could see gusts of up to mph. He added: “The heavy rain warnings for parts of Wales, South West England and North West England are indicating that some isolated areas of Wales could see as much as  mm of rainfall. Storm Jorge is not expected to bring wind gusts as strong as Storms Ciara or Dennis, but it will still bring gusts of  to  mph in some exposed locations during the warning period, which ends at midday on Sunday. But itaposs worth saying that parts of the south and east of the UK, once the rain clears early on Saturday, should often be bright, windy and cold over the weekend.” The strong winds over the weekend means people living in the warning areas should pay close attention to the advice of local emergency services, said the Met Office.Meanwhile snow will follow Storm Jorge.  Met Office deputy chief meteorologist, Dan Harris, said: “As Storm Jorge begins to weaken and slowly clear over the weekend weaposll see a trend back to slightly colder conditions, with some potentially disruptive snow over hills and mountains of Scotland and less severe wintry conditions over other hills in the north of the UK.A mixture of rain and hail showers looks likely where.  Away from much of Scotland itaposll remain blustery on Sunday, although not quite as windy as Saturday. “The weather looks likely to remain rather cold and showery into next week and thereaposs a chance of further wet and windy weather around the middle of the week, although confidence in details is very low at this stage.”  Overnight tonightNorthern Ireland There is a severe weather warnings for rain covering a large swathe of Northern Ireland including until am tomorrow including -County Antrim County Armagh County Fermanagh County Londonderry County TyroneIt warns heavy rain may lead to transport disruption and local flooding.

SallyAnn and Ryan, from the west Midlands, said the small age gap meant they formed a close bond.

SallyAnn had always wanted to be a mum and began work as a private nanny after studying healthcare in college.

Would she respect us as carers, would we get the balance between understanding her and parenting right   Fortunately, other than a few minor challenges expected with parenting a teenager, the placement was very successful and she fitted really well into our family. We found that people would just assume that she was our family member or a friend, which helped when transporting her to social activities with friends and to school, as she preferred to keep her peers from knowing that she was in foster care. We felt so honoured that she agreed to play such a key role on our special day after only living with us for just a few months, SallyAnn added.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSitting upright in a tall-backed chair, his bright, intelligent eyes amused at having to explain yet again how he has lived to be the world’s oldest man, Bob Weighton is counting the days to his th birthday. Born on March , , when there was no such thing as sliced bread, Bob has lived through two world wars and seen five monarchs on the throne and  Prime Ministers in No. But this gruff Yorkshireman is suitably unimpressed at becoming the world’s oldest man, a title he gained when the previous holder died in Japan last week. Because Bob is so much more than that: Japanese-speaker political animal artisan craftsman – and now climate change warrior. He says: “It’s good to see young people taking an interest. All power to Greta Thunberg. “There are small things that we can all do, like not buying meals in plastic trays.” Now living in Alton, Hampshire, Bob is a father of three, grandfather of  and great-grandfather of , so it’s not surprising he worries for the younger generation. His father was Scottish and mother English, but he feels strongly about his connections to Europe.He growls: “Brexit is a total mess. I didn’t want it and the people of England didn’t know what they were asking for.”One of his great-granddaughters gave him the yellow numberplate “Bob III” for his walking frame. But when Bob was a boy growing up in Hull, there were no cars – only horses and carts.  He says: “My father Arthur was a veterinary surgeon and looked after all the horses in the city. My mother Eliza was a housewe. Sadly, she only lived to . She died from breast cancer. She wouldn’t have needed to die nowadays.” Bob had three brothers and three sisters, one of whom died young of diphtheria. He says: “When my granny was still alive there were  people in our house, bang in the middle of Hull. “Our house then bears no resemblance to a modern house. We had no electricity – and Granny was matriarch.”  Bob was six when the First World War started in . He says: “I remember soldiers marching through the streets and the Zeppelin air-raids. We were bombed in Hull as well as London. It was just a chap leaning out of the window and dropping a bomb. But they set things on fire, and during the first raids, I remember hiding under the stairs in the hallway.” After leaving school, Bob followed in the footsteps of his engineer uncle and spent three years in the ship building industry on Tyneside.  He says: “When I came out of my apprenticeship there were absolutely no jobs.” So he volunteered to teach abroad and joined a missionary programme in , going to teach English in a boys’ school in Taiwan. Just before he left, he met his we-to-be Agnes. After they married four years later in Hong Kong, they moved to Canada and then America, where Bob worked as an engineer and translator before moving back to the UK in . Their three children were all born abroad. David, now , in Taiwan, and then Peter and Dorothy in Canada over the following two years.  Sadly, after  years of marriage, Agnes died in  from heart failure. They had just sold their bungalow and bought the three-bedroom flat in the Brendoncare sheltered housing complex in Alton. Bob had to move there without Agnes, and is still there. He crumbles when he remembers his we. He says: “Agnes was a marvellous woman. It’s been  years or more, but I still miss her.” He has the flat to himself, but one of the bedrooms is a workshop, where crafts little wooden windmills. He says: “I started making furniture and toys when the children were young out of financial necessity, now I just do it as a hobby.” Still living independently, the secret to Bob’s longevity has to be his zest for le. His grandson Magnus, , who lives nearby with we Caroline, daughter Elin, seven, and son Esben, five, regularly visits Bob and they speak Japanese together.  Magnus says: “I’m quite rusty now, but Bob can still read and speak the language. He’s also always been really interested in trying new things – even when it was his th birthday, he talked about expanding his horizons. “Bob has lots of friends and a big social circle. It’s what le is – it’s people. “That’s what keeps him going.” Bob has his main meal delivered at lunchtime, but prepares his own cereal for breakfast and makes mushrooms on toast for tea. The kitchen cupboards have the basics, and on the sideboard is a shopping list – one potato, one leek, kippers and smoked haddock, and a favourite, curry. He says: “I don’t eat much meat. I drink when I’m at a wedding or party, but I don’t keep any in the house.”  Bob’s never had a mobile phone and warns: “Social media is eating away at real human intercourse.” On that score, he advises: “Talk to a child asthey were two years older, talk to a man asthey were your own age, and talk to a women asshe were five years younger than she looks.” If Bob has one regret in his long le, it is that he stopped work too soon. He says: “I retired at . It was far too early. I can’t think why people want to retire at , or think that  is an imposition.”  After getting his first birthday card from the Queen when he turned , Bob is not interested in getting another one when he turns . While we are there with Bob, Emma from the Department of Work and Pensions pops round to double-check whether he has changed his mind about getting the Royal greeting card this year. Bob says, politely: “Tell her I’ve got one and I treasure it highly, but I don’t really need another one. “Please make it clear it’s no disrespect to Her Majesty, because I admire her enormously. She’s the only sensible person on the political stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young couple rent first home","story":"NewsYoung couple rent first home together to find pensioner, , living insideAmy Da Cruz and Matthew Morgan were looking for a house to rent closer to where they worked in Bridgend, so Amys mother posted an advert on Gumtree looking for a house to rentShareCommentsByMegan GrfithsKelly-Ann Mills:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsAmy Da Cruz and Matthew Morgan were looking to move into together \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Amy, a -year-old driver, said: We started talking to the landlord on WhatsApp and got really excited about the house. We were sent pictures of the inside and it seemed to have large bedrooms, a driveway, a big kitchen and garden, so we were really keen. Before the couple could look around the property, the landlord, who claimed to have recently moved from the area to Plymouth, said that he needed the security deposit in advance on the advice from his solicitor. He claimed this would ensure that the couple would be able to afford to rent the property. Amy said: We really wanted the house. So we paid £ in two payments on the understanding that we would get the money backwe didnapost like the house. On the day of the viewing, the couple were still extremely eager to obtain the property and were asked to pay a further £ as the first monthaposs rent. All of the emails and texts mentioned his solicitor and we had seen a copy of the tenancy agreement, so we had no reason to believe that something wasnapost right. The couple transferred the extra money. But when they went to the house, they found that the house was occupied by itaposs actual owner - who had no idea his home had been ly placed on the rental market. I was so annoyed, fumed Amy. I emailed the landlord straight away asking what was going on. They emailed back saying that they had injured their foot and that they would meet us the next day. We knew something was up. I asked for the money back, but have not heard from them since.  Matthew, , had already given notice on his current lodgings but was fortunately able to reverse this before they found a new tenant. However, he and his girlfriend had been left £ out of pocket. We will never do something like this again, said Amy. From now on we will only go through property management companies and never give money over before. We had our heart set on this place, we thought this would be our family home. Unfortunately, because Amy transferred the money willingly, her bank have said she is unlikely to get it back. Frank Ballinger has lived at the property in Brackla for around  years. The -year-old has described the moment he met the couple and realised that his home was offered for rent without his knowledge. The couple came here one afternoon and they said that they were here to look at the house, Mr Ballinger, a retired special constable at South Wales Police, said.

Tokyo has no Plan B for this yearaposs Summer Olympics despite alarm over the spread of Covid- in Japan and where with just five months to go before the event, a senior official said today. Thataposs despite fears mass gatherings around the world could face postponements or cancellations for months as countries grapple with the spread of the virus. There will not be one bit of change in holding the Games as planned, Katsura Enyo, deputy director general of the Tokyo  Preparation Bureau at the city government, told Reuters. Japan has invested more than £ billion and years of planning into its turn hosting the coveted Olympic Games event. Japan is eager to quell fears the Games might be called off, postponed or moved to a dferent location due to the virus, as the country tops  cases and five deaths so far. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach bolstered Tokyoaposs stance on Thursday, saying his organization was fully committed to holding the games on schedule.  Yet earlier this week Disneyland Tokyo was temporarily forced to close due to fears over the spread of coronavirus. The Disneyland and DisneySea parks in the Japanese capital will remain closed until at least March , the company announced today. What will happen to major UK events  Brits are being warned fears about the virus may now impact events later on in the year - past the two-month potential warning period - as the UK confirms its th case of coronavirus. A British man sick with the virus was today confirmed to have died aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan. Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said yesterday there could be a social costthe virus intensies. One of the things thataposs really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do weaposre going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months, he said.  Prof Whitty said he was not saying that would happen, but that the effectiveness of such strategies would have to be weighed up against the social impact. School closures are already taking place and the cancellation of some major mass gatherings looks possible as health authorities work to contain the virusapos spread.There are fears Royal Ascot , which attracts , people across five days in mid-June, could be impacted.There are also concerns the virus could impact the five-day Glastonbury Festival in late June, where , tickets have already been sold. Comic Con organisers have said they are actively and continuously monitoring the outbreak ahead of the large convention scheduled to descend on London in May. Organisers said strengthened medical support and an increased availability of disinfectants will be available at the event which takes place over three days and attracts tens of thousands.  Coronavirus has already forced event cancellations Fears over the spread of the virus have already prompted the cancellation of several large events across the globe. A Six Nations match between Ireland and Italy scheduled for March  in Dublin has been postponed as tournament chiefs are set to gather in Paris next week. Englandaposs trip to Rome on March  is now in grave doubt due to the virusapos stranglehold in northern Italy, which has become a major centre of infection with  towns in lockdown.  The final two stages of the cycling UAE Tour were cancelled yesterday after two members of staff on the race became ill. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome and star sprinter Mark Cavendish are among riders who will be tested for the virus.

Dferent scouts and dferent analysts have been given dferent leagues to look at.“They look after two or three leagues each and work along with head of recruitment Russ Richardson and myself to identy players and positions that we are looking at.“It is their call as well to flag up any players that jump out at them.“We then dig a bit deeper in terms of the contract situation and availability.“Then myself, Russ and the staff start to look more deeply at the players and all the rest of it.“Some get discarded very quickly for dferent reasons.“Ronald was one that was flagged up to us in the summer on our system.“He was the type of full-back we were looking to bring in.”McInnes’ scouting network identied Venezuelan Hernandez playing for Stabaek in Norway, before their link-up with Atlanta.However, the MLS side subsequently opened the way for the Dons to contact the South American’s agent.Due to the link up with Atlanta, the Dons will also have access to scouting data from the South American leagues which the MLS side have focused on.Ultimately the partnership is a two-way street as the Reds can also help Atlanta by identying European targets.McInnes said: “The South American leagues are an area where Atlanta have expertise and boots on the ground.”Aberdeen may now be casting the net far and wide in the hunt for talent, but McInnes emphasised that will not be to the detriment of sourcing Scottish players. The Reds signed teenage midfielder Mark Gallagher from Ross County on a two-and-a-half-year contract in January.Aberdeen also signed players like Kenny McLeanand Graeme Shinnieand developed them into full Scotland internationals.McInnes said: “It doesn’t mean to say we ignore what is on our own doorstep and what has worked for us in the past.“We did that with Shinnie, McLean and Lewis Ferguson.“Where players come from is irrelevant – I don’t care.“Whether it is our own academy bringing them through, other people’s academies, our own League, England or Ireland.“We have normally worked with British and Irish players in general.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5baf24a8f1db7-e1538213846237.jpg ","title":"mcinnes this team can go all the way","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes believes his rebuilt squad is strong enough to win the Scottish Cup.Now he wants them to prove him right with the first step seeing off St Mirren in a quarter final in Paisley tomorrow night.Aberdeen have not won the Scottish Cup since , although McInnes led the Dons to the final in , losing - against Celtic.In a bid to deliver silverware success, McInnes overhauled the Reds last summer in the busiest transfer window of his seven years at Pittodrie.He insists injury problems throughout the season derailed the chance for his side to hit top gear with form in the Premiership this year inconsistent.The Reds received a double fitness boost with midfielders Funso Ojo and Craig Bryson both set tofrom injury tomorrow.McInnes said: “You are always learning about your squad.“When you see the injuries clear up a wee bit you can start to see the strength in the squad.“I believe this squad is good enough to go all the way although we obviously still have it all to prove.“Previous Aberdeen teams have got to Hampden and it is up to this one to prove they belong there. They know the standard that has been set and it is up to us to show this squad is capable of that.”Aberdeen battled back from the brink in the previous round when overcoming a - deficit with only four minutes remaining of extra time in Kilmarnock.Two goals in the final minute of the fth round replay secured a memorable turnaround and kept the dream of lting the trophy for the first time in  years alive.McInnes said: “That showed me and everyone just how important the Scottish Cup is to them.“Also how much they want to do well. People maybe thought we were down and out against Kilmarnock but we then scored those two late goals.“That win was no less than we deserved as we were the far better team in the second half.“We were the better team in extra time and there was that resilience about us.“Now we are down to eight teams left in the Scottish Cup.“It is a weekend for us to enjoy and we have to take the opportunity to hopefully get into the last four and get back to Hampden.”McInnes ended a -year trophy drought in his first full season as Dons manager when lting the League Cup in .Since then the Reds have reached a further three finals, two in the League Cup and the Scottish Cup in .He is under no illusion as to the demands from the supporters of a strong cup run and also the benefits that can deliver.He said: “I know the importance of cups to this club.“A good cup run brings a feel good factor, numbers swell and the anticipation and excitement gets greater.“There is also the financial side. There are so many benefits from a strong cup run.”Aberdeen will welcome back midfielders Ojo and Bryson tomorrow having been ruled out of the - loss to Ross County.McInnes said: “Ojo and Bryson have been back in training which is brilliant for us.“Ojo missed the game with stitches and Bryson had a knock but nothing which we thought would keep him out of this one.“Ojo had  stitches and the nature of where it is caused problems. He wasn’t ready for Ross County because the likelihood was that would have opened up againhe had played.“We were always hopeful he would be okay for the cup tie.“It is good to have that strength again and options through the middle.”Winger Ryan Hedges is ruled out with a thigh strain suffered in the development squad’s - Reserve Cup semi-final defeat of Motherwell on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species.

More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for

lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use

are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

Musselburgh Primary Care Centre , along with Inveresk Medical Practice, which is separate.After it merged with Eskbridge Medical Practice, Riverside became the largest practice in East Lothian and one of the biggest in Scotland, with about , patients.Mr Beattie said: ldquoFrom correspondence with local constituents, it was clear to me that action needed to be taken to remedy the ongoing issues in relation to Riverside Medical Practice.ldquoI have spoken with Jeane Freeman, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, who is now working closely with NHS Lothian to ensure that a solution is found.ldquoIt was decided that the best route forward was to allow no further boundary expansions of the practice until the service is ing at a satisfactory standard.ldquoI am sure that this decision will be welcomed by all those who have concerns about the practice.He added: ldquoOf course, the NHS does not have complete control over the operations of the practice, given that the doctors are simply contracted by the NHS to run this service. However, NHS Lothian will work closely with the management going forward to ensure their budget is managed more effectively, and that the issues at hand are adequately addressed.Members of Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council have also told health bosses that the proposed boundary expansion would be ldquoa step in the wrong direction.The group contacted the Primary Care Contractor Organisation, stressing that it was ldquoabsolutely opposed to any change in the boundary area.Members also called for a meeting with health bosses, which took place recently at the practice and involved: Irene Tait, community council chairperson Margaret Stewart, community council secretary Holly Kilday, a community council member Dr Richard Fairclough and Dr Joana Stenke of Riverside Medical Practice ward councillors Stuart Currie and Katie Mackie Iain Gorman, East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos head of operations and Councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell, chairperson of East Lothian Integration Joint Board.The community councillors highlighted complaints they had received from members of the community, including:A statement issued by the community council following the discussion said: ldquoWe wondered why on earth the practice would want to take on more of a workload when clearly they are not coping with what they have to deal with at present.ldquoThe practice acknowledged the fact that they had undergone many changes in the last few years, not least the fact that they are on their third telephone system.ldquoThe practice also stated they will need to step up to the mark with a communication plan, making sure that everyone in our community is aware of how the practice is working and what options are available to them.ldquoThe expectation from the public is,they phone for a doctorsrsquo appointment, they will see a doctor and this is not always going to be the case.ldquoWhen you call you will be given two options, same day or non-urgent, and this will enable the staff to put you on to the right person who can help and this could be NHS , paramedics, physio, mental health or occupational therapistor alternatively, a doctornecessary on the same day.Wrong direction ldquoWe discussed the boundaries and made them aware that we felt that to take on Blindwells would be a step in the wrong direction.ldquoThe meeting was quite positive and hopefully, moving forward, we will keep in touch with the practice and they with us so that everyone is kept informed.Dr Stenke and Dr Fairclough issued a joint statement, saying: ldquoWe were delighted to meet with the Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council representatives and local councillors. We felt it was a really positive opportunity to discuss many of the changes that have happened in Musselburgh over the last few years to stabilise and develop primary care services.ldquoIt is really important for us at Riverside to understand the views of the community we serve, which can be hugely supportive in improving services. For example, feedback on our old phone system helped us to understand the issues that our patients were experiencing and led to us developing a new telephone system that was more suitable for our patientsrsquo needs as well as those of the practice.ldquoRiverside, along with other practices in the county, are collaborating with and supporting East Lothianrsquos Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos plan to grow health services to meet the needs of a growing population.ldquoWe remain keen to improve our engagement and communication with the local community, and the meeting was a positive step to build links with local groups.ldquoWe are grateful to the community council representatives and local councillors for taking the time to visit us at Riverside Medical Practice and we look forward to developing a closer and collaborative relationship with them.An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: ldquoWe thought the meeting with Riverside and the community council was very positive. We were impressed by Riversidersquos commitment to engaging with the community and communicating developments. We look forward to supporting them in any way that we can.Councillor Mackie added: ldquoIt was a helpful meeting with community stakeholders and local GPs. There was recognition that previous changes to the Riverside practice could have been better communicated to patients and a real willingness to improve engagement with the local community.ldquoHopefully this is the start of really meaningful engagement with local GPs at Riverside."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-advice-issued-queen-margaret-university","story":"An email sent to all students and staff says that the inidual has been told to stay at home for  days as a ldquoprecautionary measure.More than , people have died from coronavirus after it was first reported late last year.The QMU inidual has not been identied and it is not knownthey are a staff member or student at the university, based in Musselburgh.The email also states that ldquothere is no particular need for concern and the university is ldquofollowing standard NHS advice.The email reads: ldquoYou will be aware of the coronavirus from media reports, and from previous communications issued by the university, and the requirement that people ing to the UK from mainland China and other specied countries should follow ing travellersrsquo advice.ldquoIn line with the travellersrsquo advice, we have been advised that a member of the QMU community, who has recently ed from travel in Thailand, has developed flu-like symptoms, and has therefore, as a precautionary measure,been advised to remain at home for a period of  days.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

Later on, the pupils will be sharing what they have discovered with their French-speaking counterparts via a live digital link.This is a French project for the st century, and class teacher Louisa MacInnes is impressed.ldquoOne of the biggest challenges in modern languages is how to make the learning relevant and real, she says.ldquoThis way, our partner schools in the Czech Republic, Canary Islands, Poland, Slovenia and France, can see straightaway what our pupils have discovered ndash it saves time, and is much more fun for the young people involved.Mrs MacInnes, who is Principal Teacher of Modern Languages at the school, adds: ldquoIt has also been very interesting for our students to learn more about what is in their own town, and to get that across to their visitors. It has really enhanced the learning we have been doing around this topic.THE MAGIC TOUCH : Principal Teacher of Modern Languages Louisa MacInnes believes the tablets give her a great advantage by allowing her pupils to speak to youngsters in other countriesinstantaneously.Next door, newly qualied teacher Gemma Graham is equally enthusiastic.

Imagine the nations bus routes do turn into a network of mobile gang huts, full of boozed up teens terrorising elderly passengers and swinging from the fold up seats where buggies with innocent bairns are meant to fit.At least theyd be off the streets, eh In my extensive bus experience, wild behaviour is normally the preserve of the adults aboard. Last week on my journey there were glorious scenes between a beleaguered mum and her grown up son. He insisted he would sit upstairs while she complained her knees wouldnt allow her to join him.From half way along the bottom deck she screamed up to him, \"Get yersel down here.\" He would not budge and so the conversation was carried on between them as though they were in the house and he was shut in his bedroom, she insisting he come down for his tea.\"Ye cannae choose yer family, eh \" she aimed at a hipsterish young man behind her, in an attempt to strike up some bonhomie. He would have absolutely none of it and kept his gaze focused on his phone screen. Beautully done.While I do not share the naysayers concerns that the Scottish Governments plans for a National Concessionary Travel scheme for those aged  and under will lead to moving hotbeds of anti-social behaviour, I do think this policy has aimed and missed.Or, perhaps, aimed and not landed at the feet of enough people.Of course, its a refreshing change to be using the bus itself to send a message rather than sticking meaningless messages on the sides of buses.Bus use has fallen by  per cent over the past five years, data released this week by the Scottish Government shows. At the same time, car travel increased with a record number - three million - of cars now registered in Scotland.Overall, journeys made by public transport have fallen by eight million over the past year.People have a peculiar snobbery about bus travel that they do not have about trains. That quote, oft attributed to Margaret Thatcher, about bus travel being a sign of personal failure casts a long shadow. And there arent leagues of bus spotters hanging about depots in the manner of locomotive lovers.There seems to be a notion that buses are for the working classes, and not the respectable ones. Those who choose other modes of transport already seem to think the bus is a wild west wilderness and thats before the marauding young folk are added to the mix.Bus clientele, though, are attracted by convenience. Not everyone lives near or within walking distance of a train station but most streets have a bus route to serve them.Certainly the customer base is not attracted by a bargain. To travel by train from my home to Glasgow city centre is pound. for a . To travel the same distance by bus is pound. Thats a signicant sum to travel just over one mile.When I moved into my flat in  the bus fare for a single was p and remained so for over a year. Its now pound., a  per cent increase.Im sure the operator would point out that I can get the fare marginally cheaper by downloading its app and purchasing tickets that way but to do so would involve buying an updated smart phone, which Im not inclined to do. Nor should I be - bus travel should be affordable.While the bus network is in the control of private companies, it will always be designed to serve profit over people. In Glasgow there have been several services threatened with the axe and others axed completely. First Glasgow says these routes are not well used enough to continue but, for those who do use them, they are a leline.Were I still a teenager, the new concessionary scheme would be nothing to mebecause the bus route that serves the area of Coatbridge where I used to live has been stopped by First Glasgow. I used to take it in one direction to get to school and in the other direction to get into Glasgow for work.It was vital because the local train line didnt - and didnt until  - run on a Sunday, which is extraordinary when you stop to think about it.The route that was stopped, the , was the only direct service from that part of Coatbridge in to Glasgow, the only direct service up to Airdrie and also served Monklands University Hospital, all the local supermarket, the main GP surgery and the town centre. Now the area is served by a selection of shuttle buses, some that dont run on a Sunday, some that take long weekends off and some that run once an hour.I cant imagine its a unique case but it does illustrate the need for buses to be publicly owned and designed to serve the public rather than monetise them.If one of the main aims of the National Concessionary Travel scheme is to improve the environment then extend it to make bus travel free for all. Driving is infinitely more convenient than taking the bus so its no wonder that car journeys are on the increase.Buses are slow and expensive. To get to a recent hospital appointment I could have driven in  minutes for free. The bus takes  minutes and costs pound. for an all day ticket. Where is the inducement to spend nearly a fiver to sit for more than an hour on a bus when you can do acommute in comfort for  minutes \"Environment benefits\" are an opaque concept to many commuters. So far government and local council policy has been to force drivers away from their cars by punishment - raising parking costs, say - when motorists may respond more to luring than force.Raising fuel duty to make car use more unattractive is the right way to go but, once out of their cars, drivers need to know that money is being invested in a coherent, high quality and extensive bus service that preferably runs  hours.Free travel for children is a solid start but the next step needs to be ensuring bus travel is still an attractive proposition once they hit the age of ."},{"url":null,"title":"helen-mcardle-forget-petty-point-scoring-start-putting-addicts-needs-first","story":"When they were announced, much was made of the Scottish and UK Governments both staging separate events in the same Glasgow venue on back-to-back days.Could the frosty relations between the SNP- and Tory-led administrations on opposite sides of the border be any clearer If this weekrsquos summits are to be more than just talking shops the rival factions have to abandon their chronic habit of passing the buck and petty point scoring.The UK summit ban on displaying a mocked-up safe consumption room, exhibited the day before at the Scottish Governmentrsquos event, was a new low in already drawn-out and dispiriting legal wrangle.So who is to blame  Yes, Westminster has pushed through austerity policies which squeezed Holyroodrsquos budget.It is also true that most of those dying now are older addicts of the lsquoTrainspottingrsquo generation whose health is failing decades after they started using amid the doom and gloom of a recession-hit Tory Britain of the early lsquos.But the Scottish Government also decides how much to invest in health here and what on, and in the last five years spending on alcohol and drug treatment programmes in the community was cut by pound million in real terms.Funding for residential rehabilitation has been slashed so deeply that the number of beds available to NHS patients has fallen from  in  to just  today.

While the circumstances that leylandii are planted will not be conclusive as to whether there is a hedge, it is a relevant consideration.\"The judge said: \"It may well be, as the petitionersubmitted, that woodland is sometimes planted in discernible rows.\"\"The pattern of the planting in rows was nonetheless a relevant consideration in discerning whether the trees were a hedge. Hedges are generally planted in a line of some sort,\" she said.It was argued on behalf of Mr Rizza that the reporter was irrational in ordering the identied trees to be cut back to two metres without considering the effect of one row on another and in concluding that the height reduction would not signicantly alter the privacy or outlook of the hedge owner.But Lady Carmichael said: \"The reporter was deciding what action was required to remedy the adverse effects of the height of the hedge on the enjoyment of  Drummond Circus that its occupant could reasonably expect to have.\"\"Having reached the conclusion she did as to the adverse effects, it was reasonably open to her to decide that the appropriate remedy was to require the whole hedge be reduced in height,\" said the judge.Mr and Mrs Niven originally applied to Highland Council in  seeking that a high hedges notice be issued.Mr Rizza subsequently appealed to the Scottish Ministers who appointed the reporter and she gave her decision in December .The reporter concluded that the high hedge was a barrier to light which impacted on the garden and the windows of rooms at the rear of  Drummond Circus.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-due-join-greta-thunberg-bristol-climate-strike","story":"Bristol Youth Strike  Climate will begin with speeches, including one by the -year-old, on College Green at am.Greta is due to join protesters, including school pupils, on a march through Bristol city centre.Heading for the UK!

Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families. While we might be seeing a bit more daylight at the moment, winter weather can often darken very quickly and lights on bikes are essential to ensure a child’s safety.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Elyza Fraser Mausoleum is one of the current NESPT projects\"  New directors appointed to local heritage trust board viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"stephen to hold 24 hour charity pt athon","story":"An Inverurie-based personal trainer is holding a -hour fitness event to raise funds for a charity which supported his sister.Stephen Hart, of Hart Fitness, will run fitness classes throughout the day and night on Saturday, February  in aid of CLAN Cancer Support.The personal trainer was inspired to raise funds for CLAN after his sister, Lauren, turned to the charity for support following a breast cancer diagnosis.Lauren, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, accessed CLAN’s services in Inverurie including counselling and wellbeing therapies.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void.

Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits.

She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further.

Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus aer lingus confirms passenger travelled on airline from italy to dublin","story":"Dr Adrian Mairs , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  Kevin Scott   Belfast FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Adrian Mairs , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  February   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAer Lingus has confirmed that the person from Northern Ireland infected with the coronvirus travelled on the airline to Dublin airport from Italy.

In a statement Translink said the PHA has completed the contact tracing process and that Translink is taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus on its fleet. We already regularly undertake deep cleaning of our fleet and have cleaning regimes in place which include keeping surfaces clean and sanitising hand touch areas, the spokesman added. This has included additional cleaning of all Enterprise train carriages by both ourselves and Irish Rail as a further preventative measure. We have also issued guidance to all staff on the latest advice to maintain good hand hygiene practices.“PHA has advised that there is a relatively low level of risk to anyone who travels on public transport and while staff and crew in contact with the general public are not considered to be at a heightened risk of contracting COVID- as a result of their work, we continue to recommend that all staff and passengers adhere to the Public Health guidelines to help prevent the spread of germs”.Worldwide, , people have been infected with the virus.

The regulator ordered the hospital to urgently review and resolve the issue.However, the RQIA carried out a further inspection in November last year and found limited progress in relation to arrangements for medical governance.It said the hospital should stop the practice of allowing doctors to assist with operations without providing evidence of revalidation and indemnity immediately during a serious concerns meeting in July.Revalidation is a safeguarding process all doctors must go through to prove their competence, while medical indemnity is insurance for doctors in the event of negligence.However, following a further inspection in November, the RQIA said it was not assured that sufficient safeguards were in place to protect the safety and wellbeing of patients.As a result, it put in place a failure to comply notice on the registration of the hospital, which had a gross income of £.m last year. Management of the hospital was given until February  to address the concerns.An unannounced inspection was carried out on Monday. While the RQIA found the hospital had addressed six of the nine failings, a number of concerns remain, including the governance systems to assure the fitness and competence of doctors working as surgical assistants.An RQIA spokesman said: Earlier this week, the RQIA conducted an unannounced inspection at the Ulster Independent Clinic to assess progress in addressing our concerns relating to medical governance at the clinic.While compliance was achieved in respect of a number of issues highlighted in the RQIA#s enforcement notice, further work is required to address a number of outstanding actions.As a result, the RQIA has extended the enforcement notice for a further four weeks. The safety and wellbeing of every patient at Ulster Independent Clinic is of paramount importance to the RQIA and we will continue to monitor this service through our ongoing regulatory activities.A spokesman for the hospital said: We continue to work with the RQIA to further strengthen our existing administrative and governance procedures.Whilst six of the areas previously identied have been completed, we welcome the short extension for full implementation of the remaining three actions.This includes us voluntarily engaging with the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency to ensure robust arrangements are in place to support continued access for trainee doctors to observe and support our consultants as surgical assistants.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandUlster Independent Clinic urged to act to ensure patient safetyThe Ulster Independent Clinic needs to act by next month to ensure patient safety, a regulator said.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Aer Lingus confirms passenger travelled on airline from Italy to DublinHealth watchdog RQIA gives Ulster Independent Clinic extra month to meet basic safety standardsJan de Vries passes away: Tributes paid to advocate of natural medicineHand sanitiser in demand as Northern Ireland clerics fear the spread of winter virusesDefibrillator prototype by Ulster medic still in working order  years on,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On Thursday, consumer healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser said the coronavirus has helped to drive greater demand for its Dettol and Lysol hygiene products. vw,vw,px, px\"Reckitt Benckiser has seen a greater demand for its Dettol and Lysol hygiene products – Is this a pandemic The World Health Organisationhas not declared a pandemic, but says coronavirus remains an international emergency.Stormont#s health committee has agreed to classy coronavirus as a notiable disease, which would allow a judge to legally compel someone suspected of having the disease to undergo medical testing.This power is highly unlikely to ever be used, it highlights the seriousness with which the Department of Healthis taking the situation.– What is a coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome .The strain that has recently emerged is a new strain that has not been previously identied in humans.

It is a fluid situation but obviously there are people going to Italy who are concerned. Tour operators and airlines are working closely with the Foreign Office. If people want to change or cancel their holidays, fees are still in place. Some airlines are a little more lenient than others when it comes to changes but that would fall under normal ticketing regulations anyway, she said. We are recommending that people take out adequate travel insurance that covers them when it comes to disruption.

Workforce imbalances in large organisations and big companies can result from a iety of often complex factors which cannot be over looked or simply dismissed.Reducing an analysis of sectarian practice to a numbers game sheds no light and serves little purpose. So too with equating every adverse decision to a sectarian motive or using the accusation of sectarianism to address every ill.Mr Scullion added: There are a number of immediate steps which could and should be taken to starts to process of eradicating sectarianism from our society. An integrated and secular education system, a Bill of Rights , an integrated housing programme and the criminalisation of sectarianism would be a good start.However, for as long as institutionalised sectarianism forms the basis of government structures and practices, there will be no political leadership from Stormont and no pressure to address either sectarianism or the vested interests which help perpetuate it. There is still a very long way to go. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year there’s an incredible line-up for you to celebrate International Womens Day, on the bill there’s the Henry Girls, Blackbird and Crow, Reevah, Blood, Great White Lies and Tara Gi with comperes for the evening, Madonna Kebab and Thran Leeann, and ending the night with some tunes from The Stray Kitten. All that for pound in Sandino’s on Saturday, March , but before that, there are several events, some flying the flag for the women and others are just dirty garage punks who should know better.The former includes Louise DaCosta, the one-woman army making everyone take notice of her skills producing electro music. It’s been a whole year since I spoke to her about setting up her own label and got another chat to her this week… googletag.cmd.push Womens Day coming up, how are things in electronicland for women behind the decks  “Things are definitely evolving in the music scene. “There are certainly more women getting involved. “Even from our workshops theres much more interest in ladies from all ages, long overdue, but its brilliant to see and be part of the #equalisingmusic campaign.” Are there other women dj-ing you like  “Of course, too many to mention. However, there are a few emerging acts that have come through the ranks at our courses. “I’m excited to watch their progress and looking forward to seeing them smash it at our label party. “Don’t want to make any names just yet...but keep an eye on our posters and events for some super next generation talent.” googletag.cmd.push Youre the brains behind a record label, no easy job, how has that been  “Honestly its been great. Delighted to be working with so many talented artists from all over Ireland and across the world. “We’ve signed over  artists, with our focus on pushing homegrown talent, but we’ve also welcomed established and emerging artists from USA, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Malaysia, Serbia and India. “Initially, I had a three-year plan, but we accomplished all that and more within the first year... which was a pleasant surprise to say the least! “Selling out our label party events across the country, consistent radio play, hitting multiple charts with our tracks and almost  releases out within the first  months.” What have you lined up for this year  “Lots of label party events lined up nationwide as well as across the water.“Currently working with Arts Council, Blubell and ious groups delivering DJ skills digital workshops across the North West. As well as all the usual touring, looking forward to heading out to the Far East again through the year and playing across Ireland, Scotland etc. “Obviously, the big one this weekend DaCosta Records first birthday and looking forward to headlining Holi Colours Festival next month. My new track, Mermaid, is out th February.”Celtronic is  this year…. “Fantastic to see a local brand not only endure but go from strength to strength. “Long may it continue, more power to them.” What would you tell young women starting out  “Don’t be afraid to get involved. Go to a workshop, got to a course, go to events. “If you’re not invited to the party, then start your own. “Appreciate your local scene, learn and develop there. Be it, own it, do it!.” The latter obviously refers to New York’s Daddy Long Legs making a welcometo Derry this Friday night in Sandino’s. They’re the citys most beloved blues bashers have been huffing and puffing and blowing houses down on a nightly basis, on their infinite world tour and always bring an elevated level of rough and ready intensity to contemporary lo-fi blues, with their explosive fire ceremony. A Daddy Long Legs show is equal parts roots rock, blues and guttural soul, stripping down old standards and making them shiny and new again. Some of the originals are like an all-out spiritual revival, while others are hauntingly beautul. Also, on the bill are Protex, a Belfast punk band which formed in . Their first records were issued on Good Vibrations records. They formed part of the first wave of Belfast punk bands along with the likes of label-mates The Undertones and Rudi. Tickets are pound and can be acquired from Eventbrite. Asthat wasn’t enough, Stefan Murphy will be playing another intimate gig in the Grand Central this Saturday. If you were there for the last one you don’t need reminding of how special it was,you weren’t, he kicks off at ten on Saturday and it’s free.

The Brandywell was packed with fans celebrating that equaliser with him and Liddle admits it was a special night for him. “Im surprised how many people come down to these games,” he said. “The games are brilliant to play in and the league is brilliant. The crowd was great, you cant hear anything on the pitch which is something Ive never experienced before. “I love it here. I think its very competitive, its tough and I think its just a great place to come and get some first team experience.”Now Liddle is hoping that his goal against Finn Harps is the start of good times to come in a red and white shirt.“I’m absolutely delighted to come here and score on my home debut, getting the equaliser in the last minute, is brilliant,” he said. “I was itching to get on just to show what I can do and hopefully this goal will help me to continue to show people what I can do.Having started the  campaign against champions Dundalk before facing Ollie Horgan’s men last Friday evening, Liddle already knows the le in the League of Ireland is going to be tough, having been thrown in at the deep end.“The first two games have been tough,” he admitted. “Obviously we know that this league isn’t easy and to be honest every game we play we think is going to be tough for us, so we just have to take each game as they come and hopefully grind out results.”The -year-old is already a fan of team-mate Walter Figueira for his late equaliser, after the ex-Waterford man showed great skill to create the chance. “I saw him do a lovely piece of skill and get to the byline and I was thinking to get a little bit of movement so that he could cut it back, then I was just thinking to make sure I would get as much connect on it as possible and lucky for me it went in. It was brilliant to go over and celebrate with the fans.” googletag.cmd.push More paceMeanwhile, Declan Devine wants his players to show more pace in their build up play when they face Bohemians tomorrow night. City were lethargic at times against Harps last week and, to an extant, played into their opponents hands. “I think we were slow in our build up play last Friday night, theres no doubt about it, but thats credit to Finn Harps as well as they made it really dficult,” he explained. “We wanted to work down the sides of them and create overloads, but that didnt materialise and I think we got into a bit of a rut in terms of playing slowly, which suited Harps. “That said, I have to give the players massive credit because into a gale-force wind we were the dominant team and we kept going. The keeper has made a great save before Adam scored and we hit the bar. It was so, so dficult to keep the ball down and play through, but to be fair to the players they kept plugging and kept plugging and I think rightly so deserved their equaliser.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

It affirms that religious officiants should not be able to solemnise a same-sex marriage in situations where their governing body has not approved same-sex marriage. Even where a governing body has approved same-sex marriage and made provision for it, a clergyperson should have the right to refuse to conduct such a marriage . Where a religious officiant refuses to marry a same-sex couple, that officiant should not be considered to have acted in breach of equality legislation.• Civil partnershipsThe church’s decision not to provide for same-sex marriage is unchanged. The doctrine of the Church of Ireland is that marriage is between one man and one woman this is therefore the only form of marriage which may be celebrated within the church. Anglican doctrine is expressed through liturgy, and the Church has no liturgy in relation to civil partnership or same-sex marriage. The context for the response is that there has been an alteration of the legal framework affecting a range of civil provisions, but this will not affect the church’s teaching.Your headline is entirely misleading in implying that the Church and Society Commission has decided to defy the doctrinal position of the Church of Ireland exactly the contrary was made clear in the response to the newspaper.The House of Bishops, in its statement following the  marriage referendum in the Republic, affirmed that the state is acting fully within its rightsit decides to alter its legal definition of marriage.This does not affect or alter the church’s understanding of how it celebrates marriage.The Rt Revd Dr Kenneth Kearon, Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, chair, Church and Society Commission"},{"url":null,"title":"simple steps anyone can take help contain coronavirus ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionSimple steps that anyone can take to help contain the coronavirusThat a patient in Northern Ireland has now tested positive for coronavirus is highly regrettable but hardly surprising.By The NewsroomFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialThe virus is spreading rapidly round the world, and has been identied in more than  countries.The details of the NI affected patient, believed to be a woman who travelled up to the Province from Dublin with a child, and her exact movements are not yet known.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March . Parents and carers can visit the school at am, pm, and .pm.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
