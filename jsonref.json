It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Watch incredible pooch picture baffling internet","story":"An image of Piper the hairless dog went viral online due to his unusual appearance She said many people mistake Piper for a statue due to his unique look and and the fact he doesn\u0027t have hair.Pineda told Unilad: \u0027It was so funny to see all these compliments coming through of people thinking Piper was a statue.\u0027They were all really confused and asking me whether she was real or not.Owner treats her husky to a makeover - and the adorable...He\u0027s got it licked!

Plan B – what is it and why do we need one? Theresa May has struck a deal with the EU - but MPs are expected to vote it down by a massive majority today, meaning she will have to come up with a Plan B.And last week week MPs passed an amendment put forward by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve which gives the PM just three working days to come up with her new plan.It means she will be hauled back to the Commons on Monday to spell out what she will do next.The PM has so far refused to say what her Plan B will be, but she will be under huge pressure to rule out a no deal Brexit and say what direction  she plans to take the talks in next.Remainers will want her to go for a Norway-style deal, which will keep the UK in the single market and therefore free movement, or a second referendum.While Brexiteers will push for the PM to go for a Canada-style free deal which will take Britain fully out of the EU\u0027s customs union and single market.          It is believed that Tory former ministers Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve (pictured) are also involved in the plot have launched a plot to try to take over Brexit talks if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down today and she cannot come up with a plan in three days2. The Remainer plot - who is behind it and how would it work?A  group of Tory Remainers have launched a plot to try to take over Brexit talks if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down today and she cannot come up with a plan in three days.Tory MP Nick Boles said that if this happens the Liaison Committee - a committee of 32 senior MPs which is dominated by Remainers - should take over the talks.It is believed that Tory former ministers Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve are also involved in the plot.This plan to sideline the Government would flout the rules of Parliament, but Commons Speaker John Bercow - who would have the final say on if this is possible or not - has made it clear he is happy to re-write the rules when it comes to Brexit.No10 believe that if the plan succeeds then the MPs on the committee will push for a softer Brexit, for example to get a Norway-style deal which would keep the UK in the single market and therefore keeping free movement of people.3. No deal - what would it mean for Britain and who opposes it?Britain has been locked in talks with the EU to thrash out a Brexit deal, but if MPs vote it down today and a new plan cannot be quickly agreed then the UK will crash out with no deal.But many MPs have warned they will do whatever it takes to block a no deal - fearing this will send the UK\u0027s economy into meltdown. And a string of Cabinet ministers, including Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke are expected to quit the Cabinet in fury if the PM then backs a no deal Brexit.Economic experts have issued dire warnings about the fall-out of a no deal with the CBI saying it could slash 8 per cent off the size of the UK\u0027s economy and plunging the country into a massive recession.But there is a group of die-hard Brexiteers in the Tory Party, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group, who say there is nothing to fear about a no deal Brexit.This group sees going for a no deal Brexit as a step towards their goal of achieving a Canada plus style trade deal with the EU.    Jeremy Corbyn (pictured in the Commons today) is hoping to seize on the chaos if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down today to table a no cinfidence motion and try to topple Mrs May from No104. No Confidence Vote - what is it and who would back it? If the PM\u0027s deal is voted down today then Jeremy Corbyn is expected to seize on the disarray to table a motion of no confidence in the government.If the PM lost the vote, then another MP has 14 working days to hold and win a vote of confidence of MPs - if they manage this then they become PM. If no party leader can do this within the two weeks then another general election is called. But it is unlikely that the Labour leader will be able to win the backing of a single MP from the ranks of the Tories or the DUP - meaning his bid to topple Mrs May is likely to fail. 5. General Election - how could one be called and who wants it?Labour have been demanding an election, while many commentators believe that the Tories may end up having to call another election to break the political deadlock in Parliament.    Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, Mrs May would need the Commons to agree to hold another election - and many MPs will be dead-set against the plan which they fear would cost them their seats and could hand Mr Corbyn the keys to No10. But if the PM\u0027s deal is voted down and MPs cannot agree an alternative before the UK leaves on March 29 then an election may end up being called to bring in new MPs who may be able back a deal.    Many MPs are pushing for a second referendum to be held, less than three years after voters backed Brexit (file pic of voting booth)6. Second referendum – why might we need one and what would the question be? Many MPs are pushing for a second referendum to be held, less than three years after voters backed Brexit.Remainers argue that with MPs unable to agree a deal among themselves then the only way forward is to send the question back to the public.Many Labour MPs, the Lib Dems and a powerful group of Tory MPs all back a second referendum.But Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out holding one while she is PM, and even backers of the plan are at loggerheads over what should be on the ballot paper.Some Remainers believe voters should be offered a choice between the PM\u0027s plan and remaining in the EU on current terms, but some others believe a no deal Brexit on world trade organisation terms should be offered.7. Who is Gareth Johnson, the latest Tory to quit the government?Tory MP Gareth Johnson today quit as a whip whose job it is to comnvince his fellow Conservative MPs to back the PM\u0027s plan - so he vcan opose the deal.He is the latest in a long line of Tory MPs who have resigned as aides and ministers to voice their objections to her blueprint.The MP for Dartford has a strongly Leave-supporting seat, and he was appointed an assistant whip, one of the most junior ranks, in November last year.Sources said he had been \u0027desperate\u0027 to get into government, but pointed out that his voters were overwhelmingly Brexit-backing.  Resigning today, he said he was  putting his \u0027loyalty to the country above loyalty to the government\u0027.     From deal-killing amendments courtesy of the arch-Remainers to Corbyn\u0027s Customs Union gambit: How Tuesday\u0027s drama will unfoldBy Jack Doyle for the Daily Mail12.30pm: Assuming there are no delays, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC will stand up to open the final day of debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Beforehand Speaker John Bercow will select the amendments to the motion proposed by different groups of MPs. There are likely to be at least half a dozen.During the day MPs who have not spoken during the previous days of debate will stand to make their speeches.6.45pm: Mrs May will sum up the debate and make a final appeal to MPs to back the deal.7pm: Voting begins. First, MPs will vote on the amendments to the deal. If any pass, the final vote is on the deal with those amendments attached.If enough Remainer Tory MPs back the Hilary Benn amendment (see below), the deal has in effect been voted down in advance.9pm: Vote expected on the deal. After the vote Mrs May will make a statement setting out her response and the next steps the Government will take.          House of Commons Speaker John Bercow (pictured) will select the amendments to the motion proposed by different groups of MPs. There are likely to be at least half a dozen... and those other crucial votesHilary\u0027s deal-killer The most significant amendment by far, proposed by Labour’s arch-Remainer Hilary Benn, chairman of the Brexit select committee. It rejects Mrs May’s deal and ‘no deal’, and urges the Government to bring forward a motion on next steps ‘without delay’. It is backed by Tory supporters of a second referendum, including Dr Sarah Wollaston and Dominic Grieve, and is all but guaranteed to be called by the Speaker. If passed it would kill off Mrs May’s deal – but the Labour frontbench could refuse to support it.Time limit for the backstopTabled by a loyal Tory backbencher, Northern Ireland select committee chairman Andrew Murrison, this would impose a ‘sunset clause’ requiring the Northern Ireland backstop to expire on December 31, 2021. The EU has rejected such a time limit but both Tory arch-Brexiteers and the Northern Irish DUP demand one as a condition of support for the deal. Last night there were rumours ministers were quietly urging MPs to support it. Any explicit endorsement by Mrs May would enrage Brussels but, if passed, it would likely save the PM from a painful defeat.    An amendment proposed by Labour\u0027s Hilary Benn (pictured) rejects Mrs May\u0027s deal and \u0027no deal\u0027, and urges the Government to bring forward a motion on next steps \u0027without delay\u0027Parliamentary veto on the backstop Proposed by Sir Hugo Swire, this would give Parliament an effective veto at the end of the 20-month transition period over whether to enter the Northern Ireland backstop, or extend the transition. Government insiders say the veto would not be binding but it could force the two sides to come to an alternative arrangement. Ministers have said they accept the spirit of the amendment. If selected by the Speaker, it could help build support among Tory MPs but is unlikely to be a game-changer.Corbyn\u0027s customs union gambit  The Labour amendment, put forward by Jeremy Corbyn, says the deal should be rejected because it fails to provide for a permanent customs union and a ‘strong single market’ deal. It also rejects leaving with no deal.Likely to be selected but unlikely to get enough cross-party support to pass.Standing up for the workersFrom John Mann – one of few Labour MPs set to vote for the deal – this amendment provides assurances on workers rights, environmental standards and health and safety. Ministers have said they are sympathetic towards its aims, but it is unlikely to be called by the Speaker. "},{"url":null,"title":"World told 12 Thai cave boys swim freedom lie soothe parents","story":"    The discovery of the 12 Thai boys and their coach alive was sees as a miracle - however getting them out was a huge and very difficult taskOnce they had been located in their dark, subterranean cave, the spirits of the entombed boys of the Wild Boars football team and their coach soared.They now had food and medical care, but most of all they had the company of Dr Pak and three SEALs from Thai Special Forces. They were no longer alone. After the long days of isolation, the camaraderie the military men brought to the cave was a blessing.The boys — whose lives for the past 10 days had consisted almost entirely of digging, sleeping and fretting — played games. The SEALs showed them how to carve out a giant chess board on the ground with their ing knives and make pieces out of mud.ENTOMBED! The 12 schoolboys trapped in a Thai cave were...Share this articleThey played for hours in the lamplight, zig-zagging across the board to the back row to earn a king, capturing the enemy’s pieces along the way. The loser was the one who ran out of options, their final piece trapped.It was a curiously apt game, given the frantic discussions that were going on in the outside world about how exactly to get them out alive. There, those in charge of the massive international rescue operation were quickly running out of options.Waiting until the floodwaters receded was one plan that was seriously considered, but time was against this. Oxygen levels were falling in the confined space of the cave and killer carbon dioxide building up.The next big rains were also forecast to hit in a few days, and these could be a death sentence. The cave system would refill with raging torrents of water and no one would be able to get in or out.          Rescuers hold an evacuated boy inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave during the daring and treacherous rescue missionThey needed to act now, and the only course of action left was the riskiest of all — ing the boys out. One expert put it starkly to those running the rescue: ‘If we e now, some might die but if we don’t e, everybody will die and we’re just going to collect 13 bodies.’To calm nerves, the parents were told the boys were being taught how to e and the media reported that each of them would be tethered to an air hose and then swim out with one rescue er in front and another behind. This was untrue.Those who’d been inside the flooded tunnels knew there was no way a child who had never ed before could make it through the muddy and treacherous obstacle course. The only hope was to sedate them, put oxygen-fed masks with silicone seals over their faces and let the expert cave ers carry them out.But it was crucial that the masks fitted tightly, otherwise they might drown, and there was an issue with size. Dozens of full-face masks were procured, but most were for adults. Only four were suitable for children, and there were doubts that even these would do for the smallest boys.As for sedating them, that would need specialists, and a call went out to two vastly experienced Australian cave ers, Dr Richard Harris, an anaesthetist known by all as Dr Harry, and his friend and e partner Craig Challen, a retired vet. Dr Harry, who ran a course teaching emergency service workers how to e, would take on the highly delicate task of putting the boys to sleep, while, with his clinical expertise, Challen would be able to check on them as they were ed out.          The heartwarming first picture of the boys from  being treated at a hospital in Chiang Rai province, Thailand after they were rescued from the caveAs they flew in, both men were acutely aware of the mammoth risks involved and asked the Thai government for diplomatic immunity. There was a real possibility that some — possibly all — the boys would die, and understandably they did not want to be blamed.The full extent of the dangers involved came crashing in when tragedy struck. Saman Gunan was a 37-year-old former Thai SEAL who had volunteered to help. A formidable character, he ran triathlons and threw himself into extreme endurance sports.As a support er, Gunan was tasked with taking spare oxygen tanks to leave in one of the chambers along the route. He delivered them and set off back to the entrance, but he never made it. His body was found floating in the murky water, with his mouthpiece detached. No one is sure what happened. Was his air tank contaminated? Had he over-exerted himself and a build-up of carbon dioxide put his brain to sleep?Gunan’s death shattered the optimism buzzing around the mountain. If a fit, former SEAL could die, what chances did the Wild Boars have?PREPARATIONS now began in earnest, and to give their plan every chance of success, the rescuers took over a local indoor swimming pool. Thai Navy SEALs and British ers went through a secret dummy run, using three youths of small, medium and tall build — roughly the same sizes as the boys trapped in the cave.They practised putting masks on them, submerging them face down, with a er holding them underneath and passing them through the water. The youngsters were told to stay still, like the soon-to-be-sedated Wild Boars.It was a success, and this brought a lift in mood. But whether it would work in dark flooded tunnels with zero visibility was another matter.          The gripping account explains how the boys were rescued, despite there being a real possibility that some — possibly all — of the boys would dieFor Dr Harry, the vital question was what cocktail of drugs to use to keep the boys unconscious but safe for the three hours it would take to get each of them to the surface.This kind of rescue had never been attempted before, so there was no rule book to follow. He decided on a combination of three drugs. First, he would give them a tablet of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax to take the edge off their fear. Then he would inject ketamine into a leg muscle — five milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight — to put them to sleep.Ketamine acts fast but lasts only an hour. The recovery ers with each boy would then have to top them up with a pre-loaded syringe.The last drug, atropine, to reduce the saliva in the boys’ mouths from which they could drown, would also be injected into their legs.Dr Harry wasn’t confident the drugs would work. ‘I thought there was zero chance of success,’ he later admitted. Others involved were more upbeat, but even they thought that as many as five of the boys would die. Meanwhile, down in the cave, the Wild Boars were mentally preparing themselves. When they’d been told what was going to happen, they didn’t whimper or cry. They just accepted it. Whatever it took to get out of that cave was fine by them.Biw remembered thinking: ‘I’m coming out. I’m not afraid.’ A supply er suggested they should write messages to their parents that he would carry out ahead of them. He reasoned that if things didn’t go to plan, their families would at least get these final words from them.          All 12 players, pictured from top left clockwise, Adul Sam-on, 14, Panumas Saengdee, 13, Sompong Jaiwong, 13, Ekkarat Wongsookchan, 14, Pipat Bodhi, 15, Peerapat Sompiangjai, 16, Pornchai Kamluang, 16, Prajak Sutham, 14, Chanin Wiboonrungrueng, 11, Mongkol Boonpiam, 14, Nattawut \u0027Tle\u0027 Takamsai, 14 and Duangpetch Promthep, 13On white graph paper, specially treated to survive getting wet, one boy wrote a message on behalf of all: ‘Don’t worry about us. When we get out we want to get home right away. Don’t give us too much homework.’ And then, each boy penned his own words. Little Titan, the youngest, wrote: ‘Get ready to take me to eat fried chicken.’SUNDAY, JULY 8, was D-Day and that morning the ers gathered for a final briefing. They had no idea if they would finish the day as heroes or be dealing with dead children. They ran through the specifics of the plan. Dr Harry would administer the sedation, then one of four recovery ers would take the unconscious boy and transport him through the flooded parts of the cave system. Support ers would be stationed in chambers between the sumps (passages in the cave that had filled with water) to perform medical and equipment checks, administer drug top-ups and carry each boy over dry sections.Around 10am, the recovery team entered the cave and made their way half-a-mile to what was designated as Chamber 3, where a base camp had been set up. Just before midday, they set off further into the mountain.Those left behind watched the glow of the ers’ torches fade away underwater. It would be five long hours before those in Chamber 3 had any idea if the operation had been a success. Meanwhile, on the muddy ledge where they had now been trapped for 16 days, the Wild Boars were working out who should be in the first party of four to go out.Dr Pak was satisfied that they were all in good health and strong enough to make the trip. When he asked for volunteers to lead the way, many hands shot up. He asked Coach Ek to decide.Ek selected Note, Tern, Nick and Night — on the basis that their homes were furthest away from the cave. ‘We planned that, once out, they would ride their bicycles home and let the other families know along the way.’His reasoning showed how little the Wild Boars understood of what was happening outside. They had no idea the whole world was watching and waiting, transfixed by the dramatic rescue operation.Fourteen-year-old Note was the first to go. He put on a wet suit and swallowed the sedative tablet he was given by Dr Pak to relax him.He walked down the slope to Dr Harry, and sat in his lap. The anaesthetist eased two prepared syringes into his legs and the boy fell into unconsciousness.He was then put into the rest of his ing gear and an air tank strapped to his front. The air was turned on and the all-important full-face mask fitted. After 30 seconds, Note began to breathe normally.The ers then handcuffed him, tying cable ties around his wrists and clipping them behind his back. This was to ensure that if he did wake up from his ketamine slumber, he wouldn’t try to rip off his face mask, endangering both his life and that of his rescuer.British er Jason Mallinson volunteered to go first with Note. He took hold of the harness strap on the boy’s back and submerged, holding him in roughly the same position as a strapped-together tandem skyer and instructor.          Thailand erupts in celebrations as trapped football team is freed from cave and rescue chief praises successful missionThen he began swimming cautiously through the first flooded tunnel. The initial stretch was a long one, about 350 yards, before Mallinson surfaced in the next chamber, where Craig Challen was waiting to do a medical check.Note’s inert body was manoeuvred out of the water onto dry land, his ing gear and tanks removed and he was dragged on a stretcher across the rocky floor to the next half-filled sump, where Mallinson reverted to the tandem technique.Plunging into the second sump, Mallinson felt his way along in the darkness, avoiding bumping the boy into stalactites and rocks at any cost. Protecting the child often meant taking a hit himself.The recovery ers all talked of bashing their helmets again and again into the cave ceiling, and using their bodies to protect their charges. The two biggest dangers under-water were the boy waking up and panicking, or his mask leaking and turning that plastic and silicone bubble of life over his face into a death trap. Preventing the mask from becoming dislodged was a constant concern.Mallinson slowly negotiated the narrowest gap of the e before coming to another tricky point where the tunnel went vertical and he had to find a way of posting the horizontal boy through.‘It was very daunting and very slow,’ he recalled, but he was making progress towards Chamber 6, the halfway point.There, two other ers waited for the tell-tale glow of a torch in the murky water. A silhouette emerged slowly from the flooded tunnel and Mallinson surfaced with his precious human cargo.The boy was breathing and alive. The plan was working. Once again Note was hauled onto dry land, his mask and tank removed, his breathing and saliva levels checked. Everything looked good. All the while the boy slept.          Jose Mourinho of Manchester United meets members of the Wild Boars football team from Thailand in October last year They put his gear back on him and then Mallinson sank back into the brown murk with him. Diving and wading, he carried Note through the rest of the flooded cave until he reached Chamber 3, the command centre, where eager hands were waiting to haul the boy out of the water.A medical team checked him over before loading him onto a special rescue stretcher made of plastic so it could glide easily over rock. They hoisted him up a steep slope and down the other side.More than 100 people were involved in this game of pass-the-parcel as the stretcher was carried, floated through a half-filled sump, carried, floated through another, and passed on again.Slowed by the drugs, the unconscious boy’s breathing was shallow and difficult. A rescuer whispered encouragement. ‘You’re almost there!’ As Note emerged into the world, a cheer went up among the rescue workers and spread backwards, like a wave, through the tunnel, a moment of happiness and relief. They’d done it.Now, just 12 more to go.BACK IN the cave, 14-year-old Tern had watched his schoolmate Note go bravely down the slope to the edge of the water. Now it was his turn. The injections knocked him out quickly and he was kitted up for the e.British er John Volanthen had the momentous task of guiding the boy through. For days, he had been mentally preparing himself for the horrible possibility of ‘taking a live child underwater and bringing out a corpse’.He descended into the water, holding Tern close.Next to go was 15-year-old Nick, who was not even a member of the Wild Boars football team. He had gone along on the trip to spend time with his best friend, Biw. Nick was supervised by another Briton, Rick Stanton, who gripped the back of the boy’s harness. ‘They were basically packages with a handle, like a shopping bag,’ Stanton recalled.          The 11th boy to have been rescued was reportedly 11-year-old Chanin Wiboonrungruang (second left), whose nickname is TitanOnce underwater, he reached out his other hand for the guide rope and started the journey.So far, so good. The rescue was going well. But there was always a nervous moment at the start. Each time an anaesthetised boy entered the water, he would stop breathing for about 30 seconds.Most were fine but Night, the next boy to go, reacted badly to the drugs. His breathing was irregular and Dr Harry lay with him on the ground holding his airway open. It was half an hour before the boy started to recover and was ready to go. Night was given another shot and taken back into the water by Somerset-based er Chris Jewell, who was in awe of how brave all the boys were.‘They did everything right in order to make it possible for us to rescue them,’ he said. ‘I never saw a whimper or a tear in the eye. They were extremely calm, strong, determined young men.’By 9pm, the first day’s operation was over. All four boys had been carried through the flooded tunnels and all emerged safely.Helicoptered to hospital, they were placed in a sterile ward and — to their disappointment — restricted to a bland hospital diet at first. They’d presumed they’d be eating home-cooked food and sleeping in their own beds. Divers like Chris Jewell were euphoric, though their joy was mixed with the knowledge that they were going to have go through the stressful process again and again before the rescue was complete. ‘The ing wasn’t going to get any easier,’ he said.Nonetheless, the next day another four boys were successfully brought to the surface.There were problems. One started to wake as Jason Mallinson was swimming him through a partially flooded passage, and the er had to inject him while also controlling the boy in the water.           The mission to rescue the final four boys and their football coach trapped in a flooded cave  seen here in a picture posted on Twitter by US billionaire Elon Musk‘It was very tricky,’ Mallinson recalled. ‘I had syringes floating around on the surface, just trying to grab hold of them.’Fortunately, the boys remembered none of these perilous moments. The ketamine disconnected their thoughts from their physical reality, and some went off into vivid dreams.So it was eight out and five to go — but a growing threat was now hanging over the rest. Weather forecasters were warning of heavy storms approaching — the sort of monsoonal downpour that had trapped the Wild Boars in the cave in the first place.It could leave the remaining five stuck in that airless pocket two-and-a-half miles inside the mountain. The rescuers must move fast to bring them out.The next morning the ers were edgy as they assembled outside the cave. Overnight it had rained heavily, and it was still raining. The cave system was filling up again and time was short. Would their luck hold?Of the five left in the cave, Coach Ek went first on the final rescue day. His face was gaunt after 18 days of keeping the boys calm and together in the darkness, teaching them meditation, encouraging them to conserve energy.Next was Tee, oldest of the players, who somehow got snagged on a wire in the tunnel. John Volanthen remembered having to ‘park’ the boy on the bottom of the flooded cave while he cut away the wire and freed his legs.This incident confirmed the value of sedation. There was little chance of a conscious person staying calm and still if they became entangled and their rescue er left them on the cave floor.          Thousands of rescuers including Thai Navy SEALs and elite British ers had been working around the clock to come up with a plan to bring the exhausted and starved boys home safelyTitan, the youngest and second-smallest boy, went next, followed by Pong. Then it was time for Mark, the smallest and the last. Each day he had waited, desperate to get out of the miserable cave, but there was never a face-mask small enough to fit him tightly to seal out the water.One that might work had been found overnight and brought into the cave. No one could be absolutely sure it would do the job, but there was no choice.The ers would have to be extra careful not to bump him against a rock and flood his breathing apparatus — a task that had become even more challenging as, churned up by the day’s traffic, the visibility in the sumps was now practically zero.Mark got his jabs, went to sleep in his tiny wetsuit and, like the others, was brought out without a hitch. It was all over. All 13 Wild Boars had been saved and were remarkably well. Here was the fairytale ending that everyone had prayed for and worked so hard for but didn’t think possible.Outside, there were jubilant scenes. Support workers lined up to cheer and yell ‘thank you’ as each of the ers and rescue workers walked out of the cave. Parents came forward to hug them. At their camp, the SEALs, who’d led the operation from the start, sang, danced and whooped.Job done, the international team of ers that had come together to save the boys went their separate ways. Life moved on.Yet this was a story that had touched the hearts of so many people around the world. It had it all: a misadventure we could all relate to children trapped and hungry the race against time the water rising, falling the world sending its best and bravest the tragedy of an unexpected death.Then the dramatic rescue, playing out bit by bit somehow pulling off what seemed impossible and giving the world a moment of much-needed happiness.At a time when the news cycle was so often full of violence, meanness and stupidity, here was something we could all get behind. For once, we were all united in hope. We were all on Team Wild Boars and we’d all won. Adapted by Tony Rennell from The Cave by Liam Cochrane, published by ABC Books at £15.99.

However, this policy only covers 70 per cent of the company\u0027s operations. WAG said the lack of global policies on issues like humane slaughter meant that chickens being served at Burger King and McDonald\u0027s in certain areas of the world may be \u0027enduring stressful, painful deaths\u0027. Burger King, Starbucks and Subway were the only three companies out of the nine which had \u0027demonstrated interest and ambition in addressing the main problems faced by factory farmed chickens\u0027, WAP said.  A Nando\u0027s spokesperson said: \u0027Nando\u0027s never uses caged chickens anywhere in its global supply chain.  All our chickens are reared in deep littered, well ventilated barns, and in the UK, all our chickens are barn-reared to Red Tractor standards.\u0027.The company added that as well as internal checks, the company employs third-party auditors.  KFC have also responded to the report, saying that the company \u0027is committed to the well-being and humane treatment of chickens and are proud of our responsible, industry-leading animal welfare guidelines which covers the full production process.\u0027Burger King, Starbucks, McDonald\u0027s, Pizza Hut and Subway have been contacted by MailOnline for comment. Domino\u0027s Pizza declined to do so. "},{"url":null,"title":"Two year old leaves family hysterics pronounce fox properly","story":"    The adorable two-year-old Etta Wooldridge, from Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, is caught swearing to the camera as she tries to pronounce the word \u0027fox\u0027Mrs Wooldridge said: \u0027I was showing Etta her fox slippers when she started swearing.\u0027She was saying \u0027f**k, f**k, f**k,\u0027 over and over again as she looked at the fox.Hilarious moment toddler girl meets her baby brother for the...Share this article\u0027In the video my son, Felix, then tells her that it\u0027s a fox not a \u0027f**k\u0027 as though he actually knows that she\u0027s swearing which makes it even funnier.\u0027Thankfully her sisters, Amelie and Maya-Albertine, didn\u0027t hear what she was saying as I\u0027m sure they\u0027d all have starting saying it.

Shame no one can agree on what that meansThe UK government thinks it has got to the heart of the housing crisis: the problem is, new homes just aren’t beautiful enough. “Build beautifully and get permission,” says the housing minister, Kit Malthouse. “Build beautifully and communities will actually welcome developers, rather than drive them out of town at the tip of a pitchfork.”If only housebuilders would make their product more visually appealing, the thinking goes, then opposition to them would fade away, more homes would be built, prices would drop and we would all live happily ever after. The simple solution, Malthouse says, is “putting beauty at the heart of our housing and communities policy”.Hence the new Building Better, Building Beautiful commission, which was established in November to interrogate the question of beauty in the built environment and met with howls of outrage and derisive sneers. It’s not hard to see why. A parliamentary debate that preceded the announcement played out like a parody of Victorian mores, as successive MPs lined up to lament the state of modern architecture.The long-dead Le Corbusier was attacked as a man “who is responsible for many bad things”, planners were accused of having “not learned their lesson” since the war, and it was brazenly asserted that “where modern design does succeed, that is largely by accident”. Some reached for the words of Philip Larkin, while others clutched at scientific research on how the “specialised cells in the hippocampal region of our brains” are attuned to beautiful geometry.Matters weren’t helped when Malthouse tweeted a photo of a glazed commercial building on Oxford Street and a neoclassical stone courthouse in Alabama with the caption: “Both built in the last 10 years. One will stand for centuries, one won’t.” If the comment was intended to troll the architecture profession, it worked. The minister was slammed for being out of touch, anti-progress and “pandering to rightwing populist nostalgia”. It’s easy to dismiss the endeavour as a distraction from the real issues at stake, such as developers’ monopolies on land or the absence of a mass council house-building programme. But might there be something in it? John Hayes, the Conservative MP who called the parliamentary debate, might have had a point when he said: “Whereas people once anticipated development with joy, they now very often look on it with despair.” Ed Vaizey put it more succinctly: “The quality of building is shockingly bad.”There is more to housing quality than beauty alone, but if there is indeed a gulf between what developers are building and what people want, then it makes sense to look at how this might be bridged. Are architects out of touch with popular taste? Is there an obsession with new development being “in keeping” at the expense of it being good? And is a planning system even capable of regulating beauty?These questions will be tackled in a forthcoming series of public debates at Central Saint Martins art college in London, intended to raise the level of discussion beyond the realms of parliamentary platitudes. The chair of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission, Sir Roger Scruton, will thrash it out with housebuilders, modern architects will debate with traditionalists, while planners will wrangle with developers and campaigners.The government may be keen to put beauty at the top of the agenda, but whose idea of beauty are they talking about? Is it the beauty of Malthouse, MP for leafy North West Hampshire who, as deputy mayor of London, suggested funding the annual demolition of a building voted for by the public? The same man who is proud of his role in seeing the pioneering Pimlico comprehensive school bulldozed while he was a Westminster councillor? Or is it the beauty of the people who campaigned to save that building, not only on the grounds of its architectural merit, but that demolishing such a large concrete complex was a hugely wasteful act?One person’s masterpiece may be another’s carbuncle. But is there at least some public consensus on what is welcome and what constitutes blight? If so, how can we find out what it is?Some campaign groups, such as Create Streets, swear by their methods of public polling, in which people are shown photographs of different kinds of urban environments and asked which they prefer. But such exercises are prone to distortion: do you prefer a tree-lined terraced street in sunshine or a tower block glowering under leaden skies?Others think that artificial intelligence is the answer. Researchers at Warwick Business School’s Data Science Lab have developed a “deep learning” model that can determine what makes a location beautiful, based on a database of 200,000 images of places in the UK that had been rated for their beauty by 1.5 million people on the website ScenicOrNot. The groundbreaking result that meadows and old monuments are nice, while motorways and hospitals are not, doesn’t suggest that we’ll be seeing a future of automated urban planning any time soon. Perhaps aware of the difficulties ahead, Malthouse has said: “It’s totally critical to our mission of building 300,000 homes that we get this design conversation – this beauty conversation – correct.” If parliament is incapable of debating the question with the rigour it deserves, then come and make your voice heard at the alternative public forum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fc5f86b52d99f737782a18a2c252b7ae5b195cd/0_178_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc3cfa27028e647a6fb8a25fe47e1f2","title":"own limited edition andy murray print from photographer tom jenkins","story":"The multiple grand-slam winner is retiring from tennis and we are giving readers a chance to own an exclusive print by our award-winning photographer, who has been documenting the player’s career since 2005"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6aaf077cffe864157fd1af608c9c7f5c1a21717/0_0_912_547/master/912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b890f3f9887520d8d7db2ef39dfec40f","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.granitadicaffe has just “entered the gates of Purgatory” with Dante:In Il Purgatorio it takes 9 cantos before you reach Purgatory itself. On the way they meet and chat to various historical personages. The gates are a little hard to find and when you get there there are 3 large steps of marble outside: the first is white, smooth and polished, the second dark rough and cracked, and the third red like blood spurting from a vein. On these stands a big angel with a sword, who only opened the door after Virgil explained their mission. He used 2 keys, a silver and a gold one. If the latter, which is difficult to turn, won’t open then you can’t get in. It is hard to enter Purgatory but once you are inside you mustn’t look back!“I’m not a slow reader,” says kinson1964, but “I’ve been reading the same book since last year.” That book is Jerusalem by Alan Moore:A huge book (page numbers reach four figures) and it’s an amazing read. It deals with Northampton rather like Joyce deals with Dublin or Gray does with Glasgow - all human life (and death) is there together with a wealth of historical facts, trivia and metaphysical speculation. I now wish that I knew the town well for the extra psycho-geographical resonance.A Delicate Truth, “another le Carré novel leaving barbs deep in the body politic of the high and mighty of Britain”, has captivated notatalllover:Unputdownable, Toby Bell, the hero, showing the meaning of bouncebackability, having grabbed hold of the hand of someone under the cosh of the secret state faces brutal consequences in his desire to find the truth behind the lies and cover up hidden under the pacific blanket wielded by the Foreign Office. Again le Carré lets his readers know Britain is a police state in all but name. A rewarding read.A quick tip from Dennis89:Just finished Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. A short novella and the ideal read for one sitting.... Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

But we could spend all day citing prize zingers …Next year, Good Omens turns 30. In those three decades, it has sold millions of copies around the world and been adapted for radio. Terry Gilliam once attempted to make a film of it and it is (probably) going to be a huge TV series later this year. Its authors, meanwhile, have both inidually sold several million more books and had entire industries set up around them. But in the notes in the back of my copy of Good Omens, both Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett insist that writing the book “wasn’t a big deal”. The thing they say we should remember is that “in those days Neil Gaiman was barely Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett was only just Terry Pratchett”.That’s not quite how I remember it. When I got hold of Good Omens, aged 14, I’d read just about everything Pratchett had published up to that point. The idea that he’d teamed up with a gothy longhair to write about the end of the world seemed about as big as book news got. By the time I realised the book existed in 1991, a year after it first came out, it was definitely a “big deal”. Unusually for a so-called fantasy book, it had received favourable reviews in the UK press (alongside the notice in the Times that generated the memorable cover quote, “not quite as sinister as the authors’ photo”) – and it was selling in huge quantities. It had also launched in the US with considerable fanfare, and even more confusion. Publishers Weekly used the damning descriptor “zany”, while Joe Queenan in the New York Times seemed furious to be dealing with such an import. He first described the book as a cure for “the recurring disease of Anglophilia” – and then really put the boot in:“Good Omens is a direct descendant of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a vastly overpraised book or radio programme or industry or something that became quite popular in Britain a decade ago when it became apparent that Margaret Thatcher would be in office for some time and that laughs were going to be hard to come by.”I quote at length in humble appreciation of just how wrong we critics can be. It got worse for Queenan, who complained about “an infuriating running gag about Queen, a vaudevillian rock group whose hits are buried far in the past and should have been buried sooner”. Ah yes, Queen. Who recalls them now?But I shouldn’t mock. It’s actually quite a witty review – and time embarrasses every critic sooner or later. My sympathy has limits, however. It’s hard to feel anything but chagrin when Queenan writes: “Obviously, it would be difficult to write a 354-page satirical novel without getting off a few good lines. I counted four.”Oh really? Here’s four from the first four chapters:“God does not play dice with the universe He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players, to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won’t tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.”“Milton Keynes is a new city approximately halfway between London and Birmingham. It was built to be modern, efficient, healthy, and, all in all, a pleasant place to live. Many Britons find this amusing.”“There are some dogs which, when you meet them, remind you that, despite thousands of years of manmade evolution, every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf. These dogs advance deliberately, purposefully, the wilderness made flesh, their teeth yellow, their breath astink, while in the distance their owners witter, ‘He’s an old soppy really, just poke him if he’s a nuisance,’ and in the green of their eyes the red campfires of the Pleistocene gleam and flicker.”There are plenty more where those came from, as well as some fine running gags, quick (but wonderful) jokes about Welsh TV and several long and beautiful set-ups that only work within the context of the book. I almost pulled a muscle when I got to the end of the long sequence ending “I’ll call him dog” – but you have to be there. And I hope you do get there, because this is a funny book, no matter what Queenan says. Here’s a fifth “good line”:“It may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused, not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad, but by people being fundamentally people.”That isn’t just amusing – it is quietly profound. Which is the other big deal about Good Omens. Perhaps people bought it for the jokes, but my suspicion is that the novel’s gentle humanism and determined irreverence resonate with readers just as much as the one-liners. Pratchett and Gaiman are both capable of good writing – but more on that next week. For now, please feel free to continue to prove poor old Queenan wrong by posting more of your favourite lines from the book. I don’t think there’ll be any shortage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/855e51c9c3a06d78865f9ece7806e5d7c1a506b9/0_150_3772_2263/master/3772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e206eac48724ab67b5f372525f2eec83","title":"hedge fund use of private exit polls attracts city watchdog","story":"FCA says such data may be seen as inside information after funds profited at EU referendumThe City watchdog is considering fresh guidelines around the sale of private polling data to hedge funds looking to profit from major political events such as Brexit.The practice came under fire after a report detailed how hedge funds – eager to cash in on currency market volatility and profit from the EU referendum – commissioned private exit polls to bet on the price of sterling in the run-up to the June 2016 vote.Those private polls showed a Brexit win, giving hedge funds an edge over the public, as broadcasters ran comments after the polls closed from prominent Brexiter and the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage suggesting that the remain vote would “edge it”.The Conservative MP and Treasury committee chair, Nicky Morgan, has warned that the sale of private polls to hedge funds during key political events poses risks to the “integrity of UK financial markets”.The Financial Conduct Authority previously said it would not crack down on hedge funds over the purchase of private polls unless it was used in a way that broke the rules.But its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, told MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday that he had given the issue “quite a bit of thought” and is looking at whether the FCA could step in through regulations meant to cover insider dealing and inside information.“I think the market abuse regime bites here,” Bailey said. The FCA’s Market Abuse Regulation extends the regulator’s reach to new markets, platforms and “behaviours” and aims to boost “market integrity and investor protection”.Additional scrutiny by the FCA could be significant as Britain hurtles towards a formal exit from the EU on 29 March. Interim events such as Tuesday’s parliamentary vote on Theresa May’s exit deal continue to grip markets and create opportunities for investors and hedge funds to cash in.“We are giving thought at this stage … as to whether we could usefully issue guidance, not obviously to change the rules but to issue guidance on the application of the rules, particularly on this question of inside information,” Bailey said.He pointed to similar work undertaken by the FCA to help the Office for National Statistics when it aimed to end the circulation of official data ahead of its release. That is despite the ONS falling outside the FCA’s regular jurisdiction.“We helped them to get that outcome using the market abuse regulation regime … it might be somewhere where guidance might help,” Bailey explained.The FCA chief is finally due to sit down with representatives of the British Polling Council and Market Research Society, which regulates the polling industry, from next week. The FCA publicly confirmed plans to meet both groups back in October.Morgan wrote to British Polling Council president, Sir John Curtice, in the autumn, highlighting concerns over “potential conflicts of interest in the business model of the polling industry”.She pointed to the practice of making market sensitive data such as exit polls available to private clients before it can be legally released to the public, and the way revenues from private polling work may help subsidise public work.“At worst, there could exist a perverse incentive for polling companies to provide misleading or inaccurate information to the media, while providing high-quality analysis on the true state of public opinion to private clients,” she said.Curtice hit back, saying: “The implication of this remark appears to be that during the EU referendum polling companies may have deliberately released inaccurate published polls at less than cost price because this enabled them to extract a higher fee from their private clients.“Casting doubt as it does on the professional integrity of the industry, it is a suggestion that we feel either needs to be substantiated or withdrawn.”The Treasury committee has not responded to Curtice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df2e32f53ce5e199a5c1b01d21e3d6ed5b4c554b/0_68_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae63cc5a7e90caea993906baeca3f1d","title":"marks and spencer stores close m and s hull","story":"M\u0026ampS outlets in Bedford, Hull, Huddersfield and Rotherham among those to be axed with 1,000 jobs at riskMarks \u0026amp Spencer has dealt a fresh blow to the high street as it announced another wave of store closures, putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk.The struggling high street giant is closing one in three of its main stores – those that sell clothing, homewares and food under one roof – and on Tuesday revealed the locations of the next 17 branches to close in coming months.Sacha Berendji, the M\u0026ampS retail, operations and property director, said: “Proposing to close stores is never easy, for our colleagues, customers or the local community, but it is vital for the future of M\u0026ampS.”M\u0026ampS’s decision to retreat from a swathe of UK towns and cities comes as many high streets are struggling with fewer customers and the shift to online shopping. The most recent figures available showed the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty soared in the first six months of 2018.Despite its problems, M\u0026ampS, with its broad range of products, is a prized high street name as its stores attract 19.5 million shoppers every week. Local MPs and councillors vowed to try to persuade the company to reverse its decision.Emma Hardy, the MP for Hull West and Hessle, also tweeted that she was “extremely disappointed” by the decision to close the store in her city and was seeking a meeting with management.She was joined by her Hull North colleague, Diana Johnson, who asked: “Why is one of the great cities of the north losing its Marks \u0026amp Spencer?”Another affected town is Ashford in Kent, which has been held up as an example of retail regeneration. But Graham Galpin, a senior Ashford councillor who helped write the recent government report into the UK’s beleaguered high street, was more pragmatic: “There is simply too much retail space in the UK, hence we must expect some reductions.”The store closures, spread over a five-year period, are part of the latest M\u0026ampS plan to tackle years of falling sales and profits. The cull began in 2017 after the chief executive, Steve Rowe, said he would slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to M\u0026ampS’s clothing ranges as sales transferred to its website.M\u0026ampS has about 1,000 stores, a figure that includes 300 “main” stores and a large network of Simply Food convenience outlets. About one-third of the first group are said to date from before the second world war. M\u0026ampS has confirmed the locations of 55 of the 100 affected stores.The shopworkers’ union Usdaw said M\u0026ampS’s “piecemeal approach” was extremely distressing for staff. “Today we’ve seen a fourth wave of closures announced, which is devastating news for the staff in those stores and the uncertainty continues for everyone else,” said Usdaw’s national officer, David Gill.The company has refused to rule out an even bigger store closure plan.The locations of the 17 stores announced on Tuesday are:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6862923efab9bf556f06e3aaae5fd6ef0537984f/0_80_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d040517f2c067281cd434c001dc897f","title":"duncan jones parenting complaining tweets children","story":"The film-maker’s despairing tweets about having children have caused uproar. The rest of us should have more sympathyAmong the great lies of our time are: the Brexit agreement will be “one of the easiest in human history” “Mexico is going to pay for the wall” “We tried to deliver your parcel but you weren’t in” and “Nobody ever tells you how hard it is to be a parent”.The latest person to tell us how hard it is to be a parent is Duncan Jones, a filmmaker, father of two and the son of David Bowie. He “sparked debate” (AKA a social media pile-on) this week with a series of tweets about life with children aged two-and-a-half and nine months. “I’ll tell you something I never see anyone admit,” he wrote. “They are exhausting, frustrating and life-destabilizing. They are rarely fun. Sure, smiles are great, hugs are lovely, but it’s HARD \u0026amp not obviously a good choice in life.”The reactions to his honesty have been interesting. While many people criticised Jones for airing his dirty nappies in public, calling him a cruel father and a horrible person (though usually in shorter words), one newspaper reported him as tweeting, in a “hilarious” post, that he “wouldn’t change it for the world”. But what he really said was: “This is where people feel compelled to say ‘i wouldn’t change it for the world!’ But you know… Of course I’d reconsider! It’s exhausting! Its banal! It’s like looking after a dog you can’t housetrain.” What these responses have in common is that they deny his right to tell this story. Parents tell us how hard it is all the time – it’s just that some people really don’t want to hear it.Despite popular wisdom, research shows that having children tends to make people less happy. It’s hardly surprising, since what babies inflict on parents is essentially a prolonged form of torture. Sleep deprivation, bleeding nipples and Baby Shark going round and round your head for weeks are all actually banned by the UN. But for some reason, parents are not supposed to admit that all of this is hard to bear.We know this, though, if we listen. I sometimes see 3am posts on social media from new parents who say, “I am struggling… This is unbearable… I can’t cope.” What really shocks me is when other parents jump in to comment: “Ha, you don’t know anything yet! Just wait until you have two of them! When they’re teenagers, then you’ll know what unbearable is...” Funnily enough, these are often the same parents who judge the choices of people who don’t have children, and suggest to us that we will regret it. Perhaps people without children do actually have some idea of how hard parenting is. Maybe that’s one reason why we don’t do it. But we can still try to be a bit more supportive of people who do.As a non-parent, I probably can’t truly understand what parents are going through. I have no advice to offer about colic or cabbage leaves, or the unique agony of going back to work or choosing the right school. But I can drop everything to come and do your washing up on a day when everything seems too much. I can fill your freezer with bolognese sauce, or talk to you about something other than shades of baby shit, and if you tell me that sometimes you feel you just can’t cope with that tiny tyrant, I will say “Hell no! I couldn’t do it. And I am absolutely in awe of you that you are.” I will also say, having read, watched and reread The Handmaid’s Tale, thank you for doing this so that I don’t have to.Frankly, a society that puts so much pressure on people to have children, and then never complain about it, really ought to make life easier for those who willingly sign up to 18 years of hard labour. Research shows that parents are even less happy in countries that don’t support them, but that policies such as subsidised childcare and paid leave make the burden a lot easier to bear. Perhaps Tulip Siddiq MP, a member of parliament’s women and equalities select committee, will sort all that out when she gets back from having her caesarean – which she had to delay so that she could take part in the Brexit vote this week.The rest of us can do our bit by being less judgy of other people’s choices, and having some sympathy for those who are finding it tough. As Duncan Jones also wrote: “What it is, is that it is. \u0026amp they are mine. Hopefully they turn out OK.” With parents who love them so much that they would go through torture for them, they will probably be fine. But they might do even better if their parents had more support and less criticism.• Katy Guest is a freelance writer and editor, and a commissioning editor for the publisher Unbound"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c97623c9ba693eac8ba4fb36de6d63a5473eecf/0_227_5244_3146/master/5244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a2610de94a951a764d7bbdcaaa967b","title":"little bit byron love swish of a good cape","story":"Do you know what time it is? As far as I can tell, it’s nearly cape o’clock. Watching Billy Porter at the Golden Globes, modelling a pink-lined Randi Rahm cape in a crucifix pose, looking like a bird of paradise, I have come to the conclusion that this is the next menswear trend we need to see.We almost certainly won’t, but why not? Are they not seen as masculine? Batman wears one, for the love of all that is holy. Dracula, too, for what it’s worth. Given the ongoing saturation of superhero films, it’s strange that this classic piece of hero’s attire hasn’t filtered through to the high street already. Although nowadays not all heroes wear capes – in fact most don’t any more. The Incredibles’ supersuit designer dispensed with them because they were a propeller hazard. And there’s the clue. Capes lack functionality these days they are purely decorative. Feminism allowed women to wear – well, not the trousers, but at least some trousers, while most men have remained largely resistant to their counter-liberation.What a shame, this cape fear. Aren’t they the most gorgeous, theatrical items? Some riding jackets and driver’s coats (the waxed Driza-Bone from Australia, for example) inch toward their elegance. But they are not the full Byronic deal: dashing and full of flair and mystery. Can anyone resist the unique physical and visual thrill of a good cape swish?

Just a few weeks ago Senator Joni Ernst and Representative Steve King of Iowa shared a warm embrace – there are photos of it all over the internet since Ernst condemned King last weekend for wondering whatever happened to good old white supremacy. And then the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, was going to take King out to the woodshed on Monday for a good talking-to about his latest utterances, the likes of which Ernst and McCarthy ignored over the past 16 years. The House Democrats, who never shed a dime trying to unseat King, now want to censure him.The hypocrisy is epic and comic.King, 69, has talked redneck since he ran for the Iowa senate from Kiron. Nothing new there. It got him so popular with the base to become Governor Kim Reynolds’ campaign chairman in November. Ted Cruz, who also last weekend gave King the Judas kiss with that new beard of his, used to pick off pheasants on a dude ranch near Akron with the Sage of North-west Iowa. Cruz once so admired King that the Texan said that Chuck Norris sleeps in Steve King pajamas. This as Cruz was telling a Dreamer from Storm Lake that he would deport her first thing if he were running this show.Pining for the good old days when Mexicans kept their heads down picking lettuce, nobody raised an objection when King and Trump repeat that Latino teens are a bunch of drug-runner-good-for-nothings. But when it allows a Democrat to come close in this little slice of Texas that is western Iowa, well, that is another matter entirely.Dawn came on the Wednesday following the midterm election to reveal that it was not a dream: Democrat JD Scholten had come within three points of King with almost no funds. A used Winnebago camper was his campaign centerpiece and home on the road. The entire GOP establishment was shaken in its boots: voters were getting fed up with institutional racism.The money in Des Moines talked state senator Randy Feenstra of Hull into running. He is a darling of radical conservatives, a Dordt College professor who is more polite about plans to deport millions of immigrants and turn back desperate asylum seekers. Feenstra proclaims that he walks every step with Trump but is not as “caustic” as King. That is, not as frank.King’s brand always has been a straight shooter not afraid of what anyone thinks. He showed Trump the way to The Wall. Right after Feenstra announced, King was berating him on Twitter for disloyalty. After he was stripped of his agriculture and judiciary committee assignments by McCarthy, King declared defiantly that he had been denied his free-speech rights and that he was the victim of “a political decision that ignores the truth”. King will tell the base that he and Trump walk the lonely path alone to recovering our greatness. Feenstra and McCarthy and the rest of them are afraid of what he represents, and what is so wrong with white nationalism anyhow?Other challengers gather. One is a popular county supervisor from populous Story county (Ames, home of Iowa State University), another a businessman from rural Shelby county. One could imagine others, and how that clears an easy path for a King renomination.Which leaves many of us confused, chief among them Scholten. He thinks he can beat King, but he has not fully sized up Feenstra. “They really like him up there,” Scholten said of Sioux and surrounding counties, which we call Dutch country for all the conservative Hollanders.Yet Scholten is scheduled to speak with the Sioux county Democrats. If Republicans could clear the field for a Feenstra-King showdown (which they can’t, really), would the people who have loved King for so long abandon him for a nicer and seemingly less nutty version in Feenstra? If Trump be our guide, then no. King will not back down. Losing a committee assignment from a minority backbench is liberating to King, certainly not punishing. He does not need the judiciary committee to give him voice when Fox News is standing by – and they will stand by. He never needed the congressional campaign money before. Why would he need it now when he earns so much publicity for nothing? He knows the wingnuts will come through for him, from Austria to Alabama.This will be a lingering problem for Ernst, facing re-election in 2020. Scholten knows it. He wants to run against her but knows how formidable any incumbent is, especially her. The entire Republican machinery that owns Iowa government will be at her shoulder. Scholten doesn’t think former governor Tom Vilsack will run. Scholten already was wedding Ernst to King irrevocably on Twitter over the weekend, along with tens of thousands of others. Those reminders will linger and amplify and stew over the next couple of years.Steve King is every Iowa Republican’s tar baby who cannot be shaken off their boots like a bread bag that Ernst put on hers waiting for the school bus along that gravel road. Ernst could be Scholten’s opportunity. He came so close to King he has this Beto zeitgeist thing going. A betting man might lay odds that King will prevail in a primary as a visionary zealot who prepared the way for our fearless and feckless leader Trump. The Establishment is playing into King’s hands: a GOP primary scares off Scholten, who developed a pretty broad following in his introductory campaign, and King waltzes back in. It’s what King lives for. You can’t march with Trump and shrug off King. He is part of the bargain.• Art Cullen is the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of The Storm Lake Times in Northwest Iowa.

This year has broken all records and hopes are high that most of those holding offers will get the required A-level grades to secure their place. Two-thirds of the students would be the first in their family to attend university and half have been in receipt of free school meals.The academy’s executive principal, Dr Dayo Olukoshi, said: “We were delighted when last year we sent 20 students to Oxbridge, having seen the number increase gradually from just one offer in 2014. For this to have more than doubled again is phenomenal but does not surprise us – our vision has always been to never put limits on what our students can achieve, and I think these offers reflect just that.”The sixth form is selective and highly sought after, with 2,000 to 3,000 applications for 300 places in the lower sixth. All candidates are interviewed before being offered a place and some students make long journeys – as much as two hours each way – to attend.“It’s amazing,” said Sam Dobin, the director of the sixth form. “We are absolutely buzzing as a school. The students are amazing – I get in at 7am and there will be 80 or 90 already there working. That’s how they do it. It’s not some sort of miracle.”Dorcas Shodeinde was among the successful students. She has been in care since she was 14 and now has an offer to study law at St Catherine’s College, Oxford. “When I was put in care, all I knew was that statistically care leavers don’t do very well,” she said. “I was determined that my future would be different.”Rama Rustom, who came to the UK as a refugee from Saudi Arabia in 2013 with Palestinian and Syrian parents, has an offer to study English at St Hilda’s College, Oxford. “For me, this offer sets my family on a new path. In my culture, women are traditionally told to not pursue education. I’m trying to prove that girls can do it too,” she said.Victor Idowu, who is from a single-parent family in receipt of free school meals, would be the first in his family to go to university. He has an offer to study medicine at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He said: “This is something that I have wanted my whole life. It’s made my family really proud.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c69a0a3bfd3fc4704e461055ad4dbe24270f1c82/0_388_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c89c6df5799f02d6d4ca5cd6f73cea3","title":"together well flourish the birmingham school tackling segregation","story":"Admitting students from across the city, University of Birmingham school is creating erse place to learnIt takes 14-year-old Cameron Matuvangua-Fernandez more than an hour to get to school. He gets up at 6.15am each morning and starts his day drinking hot chocolate out of a Winnie the Pooh mug when most children are still asleep.The city is enveloped in darkness when Cameron leaves the house at 7.15am to get his first bus. He meets his friends in the city centre, who tease and jostle each other, before they board their second bus of the morning. The school is based in a leafy suburb in south Birmingham, but Cameron lives in one of its three other catchment areas, which are located in far more deprived parts of the city.While he takes two buses to make his way to class, bleary-eyed, it takes Cameron’s classmate, 14-year-old Harriet Giles, about five minutes to walk to the same school.The University of Birmingham school (UoBS), which Cameron and Harriet attend, is one of the only secondary schools in the country to have four catchment areas across the city. The school opened in 2015 with a simple belief: “Together, we’ll flourish.”Most students in England go to the secondary school that is closest to their home, but previous research has shown that house prices shoot up when they are located near a good, popular school. Education academics and school teachers say this standard admission policy, known as a catchment area, means access to good schools is determined by parental income. The 2016 government report into segregation, known as the Casey Review, listed Birmingham as one of the top 10 areas with some of the most segregated schools in the country.James Arthur, a professor at the school of education at the University of Birmingham, and the founder of UoBS says: “Birmingham is quite segregated. You have an east side of Birmingham that’s predominantly Muslim and Pakistani origin and you have a south side, where we are today, which is predominately white and more affluent. We were very conscious that we didn’t want to have another school in the south of Birmingham that would just reflect the south of Birmingham.”Cameron and his friend Glyn Harrington, 14, were two of the first pupils to start at UoBS in 2015, their class hailing from 61 different primary schools. Sitting at the back of a doubledecker bus, they agree their journey into school is “long” and tiring, but they insist it is worth it.In primary school, Glyn says, mixing did not really exist. “It was either you’re friends with the black kids or you’re friends with the white kids and it sounds really racially rude in some sort of sense, but it’s not really like that,” he says. Pointing to Cameron, he says he has not been such good friends with a mixed-race Spanish person before, adding Cameron is often found nodding his head to Latin music.Cameron, who attended a Catholic primary school, says: “Religion is another key thing as well. In my primary school, there was no Muslim religion or anything. When I came to secondary school, it was nice to get to know other religions and see what they get up to.”It is what Arthur intended. “To live in Britain today I think it’s very important children experience various people and they can only experience that if they actually meet them. They’re not going to experience this if they’re in schools which are effectively segregated,” he says.Getting students from a variety of backgrounds is just one part of the school’s mission, the other is its focus on “character education”.“It’s our way of inspiring and teaching children to lead more flourishing lives by increasing their standards of what virtuous behaviour might look like. We encourage them to show courage, compassion, empathy, justice, honesty, on a day to day basis,” said Rebecca Tigue, the head of school.The school’s admission policy and focus on character education has given the students a unique experience. Kaya Chauhan Humphries, 15, who gets up at 6am to get the 7.10am train to school, says: “You hear stories of people who are in really bad positions because of bullying and you realise just how different this school is because you don’t have it. It’s a reality shock.”The erse cohort proves to be a challenge to a school that is committed to mixed ability classes and inclusion. “The ability range between classes is absolutely huge and it can become an issue for some students. So for those students who really need the extra support, a decision was taken to develop an intervention group and we can really target them so they maximise their learning time,” says Kevin Cobane, a primary school specialist who started at the school a few months ago.The school has had a few incidents of racism and homophobia, Tigue says, adding it is more common among the younger students. “We specifically talk about racism, we specifically talk about homophobia, but we create safe spaces so students share the voices they have.” Staff work with students to challenge these ideas, she says.At the end of last year, the school was rocked by a violent incident in which three of its students were stabbed outside the school gate. The victims did not sustain life-threatening injuries. While the incident burst the bubble the school had been operating in, one teacher said it reinforced their commitment to character education and openness.Harriet, Kaya, Glyn and Cameron sit in the library near the end of the school day, laughing about the different accents they hear in their school. “I get called posh sometimes, but I don’t really mind, it doesn’t bother me,” Harriet says.“I think it’s really good that I’ve met these people because they’re probably going to be friends for life,” says Kaya.As the students walk past a cooking class, Glyn tells the others he had olives and sundried tomato for the first time last week. “Oh my God,” Cameron, whose mother is from Spain, says. “When you come to Spain, you’ll try everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4a64d6fc9682e49928f4c49f6b491e0b3aa0329/0_274_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2396c8562e7c5673c7e4d5f293713f46","title":"eu glyphosate approval was based on plagiarised monsanto text report finds","story":"Study for European parliament ‘explains why EU assessors brushed off warnings of pesticide’s dangers’, says MEPEU regulators based a decision to relicense the controversial weedkiller glyphosate on an assessment plagiarised from industry reports, according to a report for the European parliament.A crossparty group of MEPs commissioned an investigation into claims, revealed by the , that Germany’s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) copy-and-pasted tracts from Monsanto studies.The study’s findings have been released hours before a parliamentary vote on tightening independent scrutiny of the pesticides approvals process.The authors said they found “clear evidence of BfR’s deliberate pretence of an independent assessment, whereas in reality the authority was only echoing the industry applicants’ assessment.”Molly Scott Cato, a Green MEP, said the scale of alleged plagiarism by the BfR authors shown by the new paper was “extremely alarming”.“This helps explain why the World Health Organization assessment on glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen was so at odds with EU assessors, who awarded this toxic pesticide a clean bill of health, brushing off warnings of its dangers,” she said.The European Food Safety Authority (Efsa), based its recommendation that glyphosate was safe for public use on the BfR’s assessment. An Efsa spokesperson said: “The report does not provide any new scientific information that calls into question the assessment and conclusions of glyphosate. Efsa stands firmly behind the integrity of its risk assessment processes and its conclusions on glyphosate.”In a statement, the BfR rejected any notion of deliberate deception, saying that its authors had evaluated the relevant industry reports before selecting passages of text to “integrate”.“We often see that the complexity of the conventional procedure for the re-approval of the pesticidal active substances is not understood properly,” said the BfR professor, Dr Andreas Hensel. “The term ‘plagiarism’ is not relevant in this context.”A separate analysis of research methods used to evaluate glyphosate by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also raised questions about regulatory independence.Jo Lewis, the Soil Association’s policy director, said: “It is unacceptable that pesticide-industry studies receive greater recognition than scientific peer-reviewed open literature in regulatory decision-making. Whilst this paper focuses on the US EPA, similar criticisms have been made of EU decisions and we fear that outside the EU, pressure to approve pesticides will increase.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fe01e1ce92a2a2b856b9debe09b0d1a0e279f7d/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c99f141adad63a3914b2281c76c3b1e","title":"juliet and friends found for romeo the lonely water frog","story":"Five frogs found on Bolivian expedition funded through lonely hearts profileFor 10 years, Romeo, the last known Sehuencas water frog on the planet, led a solitary life in a conservation centre in Bolivia. Now scientists have found him a Juliet.The adult female was among five frogs found on an expedition into Bolivia’s cloud forest. The $25,000 search was funded by donations gathered after Romeo’s keepers posted a lonely hearts profile on the dating website Match on Valentine’s Day last year.“Now the real work begins – we know how to care for this species in captivity, but now we will learn about its reproduction,” said Teresa Camacho Badani, of the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d’Orbigny in Cochabamba, who led the expedition. The scientists hope to prevent the extinction of the frog by breeding new generations and eventually releasing them back into the wild.The frog was once abundant in the streams and ponds of Bolivia’s cloud forest, but there has been a precipitous decline of all water frog species in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru due to a combination of climate change, habitat destruction, pollution, a deadly amphibian disease and the introduction of alien trout species that eat frog eggs.Badani said the team had been close to giving up when the frogs were discovered. “We were exhausted after searching all day with no results,” she said. “We looked in streams that had the perfect conditions, but we didn’t see any species of frogs, water frog or otherwise.“We decided to look in one more stream before returning to the camp. We weren’t too hopeful because there was a waterfall at the end of the stream that would stop us from moving forward. But we took a chance anyway and about four metres away from the waterfall I saw a frog jump.“When I pulled it out, I saw an orange belly and suddenly realised I had in my hands the long-awaited Sehuencas water frog,” she said. “My first reaction was to yell ‘I found one!’ and the team came running over to help me and pull the frog to safety. It was an incredible feeling.”In total, the team found three males and two females.Chris Jordan, of Global Wildlife Conservation, which was also part of the expedition, said: “There is always risk in bringing animals in from the wild to build an insurance population. But at this point it seems there are too few water frogs in the wild for them to retain a viable population, so there’s a greater risk if we don’t do anything.”The five frogs are now in quarantine as they get used to their new home and will be treated for the deadly infectious disease chytridiomycosis, which is partly responsible for the steep decline in amphibians around the world. After this, Romeo will meet his Juliet.Badani said: “Juliet likes worms as much as Romeo. She is very strong and swims very fast. She looks great and is healthy. Opposites attract: while Romeo is very shy, Juliet is not at all. So we think she will make an excellent match for Romeo.”Breeding and reintroduction programmes have worked for other species including the Mallorcan midwife toad in Spain. At least 10 populations of this species have been successfully reintroduced to the wild.Romeo’s story seems likely to have a happier ending that that of Toughie, a Rabbs’ fringe-limbed tree frog originally from Panama and also the last known member of his species. He died in 2016 after 11 years in the Atlanta Botanical Garden and the species appears now to be extinct."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f175c4039c904fbc08ed43f1ac1ba52e6d09fc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45aa7dbd6c7933d9cb964eca80d7c93e","title":"milan mens fashion week 10 key collections in pictures","story":"Frankenstein’s monster at Prada, teddy bear coats at Ralph Lauren, a take-over of Milano Centrale train station… Here are the menswear show highlights for autumnwinter 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81f09091530e2cf1ca4b5c4e4aafac71b88279b5/0_225_4921_2952/master/4921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=badd70a0cebe9f66882211b2e32d7401","title":"arsenal head recruitment sven mislintat future","story":"Arsenal’s grand plans to restructure in the post-Wenger world have begun to splinter with Sven Mislintat, brought in as head of recruitment, set to leave after feeling his position has become untenable.The German, whose ideas in the sphere of spotting and developing talent are highly regarded in European football, was initially appointed in November 2017 by Ivan Gazidis, with the idea that his role would evolve to become a technical director as the club aimed to continue to refresh its operation once they moved on from the Wenger era.Arsenal’s long term former manager was no fan of a technical director and brushed aside the concept, which was one the club were keen to move towards.Since Gazidis departed to join Milan and handed over to a new internal management scheme led by the director of football, Raul Sanllehi, and the managing director, Vinai Vinkatesham, Mislintat’s chances of becoming technical director slimmed. He was the natural choice, but with Arsenal looking elsewhere, including towards their former midfielder Edu (currently a coordinator of Brazil’s national team), Mislintat senses that he would be sidelined, no longer having a decisive say in prospective signings. It seemed like his position, instead of growing as he had hoped, would be reduced to that of a glorified chief scout, which is not what he moved from Borussia Dortmund to do.Quite apart from the experience he can bring to the role, as a person Mislintat will be a loss to Arsenal. In character and ideas, he shares something of Jürgen Klopp’s rock and roll vibe and a similar bigger picture belief in football’s capacity to pay attention to the game’s soul in a heavily financed modern world. He had a lot to offer to the strategic overhaul intended to refresh the way the club operates at executive level and brought with him a modern way of thinking and a strong passion for his area of expertise.Mislintat has in recent months been part of the new executive team set up to bring a shared leadership which included fellow German Per Mertesacker as head of the academy and senior figures from the business, football, contracts and data side of the club. He is the kind of person who is keen bring his own ideas to the table, without feeling the need to adhere to convention. Down to earth, as interested in people as performances, his attributes extend beyond just having a good eye for a potential player.Arsenal face losing a man who thinks outside the box. Before moving to London he spent many years at Borussia Dortmund, where he progressed the likes of Shinji Kagawa, Robert Lewandowski, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Ousmane Dembélé. This track record made him an exciting appointment for the overdue modernisation of recruitment at Arsenal. Dortmund provide a useful example for a club hoping to streamline their operation and become more efficient in the market by spotting potential talent before they become prohibitively expensive.Mislintat was heavily involved in the recruitment of Aubameyang a year ago. Arsenal then signed a range of players during last summer’s transfer window – a club record for goalkeeper Bernd Leno, experienced defenders Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Stephan Lichsteiner, and the youthful zest of Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi in midfield.But there is unease during this January window as Emery admitted recently that the club can only deal in loans. With Aaron Ramsey set to leave on a free at the end of the season, Petr Cech announcing his retirement, Danny Welbeck’s contract unlikely to be renewed and the ongoing bafflement over the situation engulfing their highest earner Mesut Özil, this is far from an ideal time to have upheaval on the recruitment front."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c18180fd62c2a1e3889eaeb8986c317c896388e/0_253_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984074fd68d6144cb3a81744491a13df","title":"the fiver petr cech to retire arsenal chelsea","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Unlike say, a certain couple of Fulham players, it is difficult to imagine Petr Cech ever clashing with a teammate during a yoga class. While it is easy to imagine the Arsenal keeper trying somebody’s nerves by complimenting them excessively on their Downward Facing Dog, repeatedly offering them drinks from his water bottle or accidentally treading on their velvet slings, the prospect of actually coming to blows with one of football’s nicest men in any environment seems so implausible as to be utterly beyond the realms of possibility. Google “Petr Cech” and “controversy” and one of very few occasions in which the 36-year-old appears to have lost his cool in a senior career ning almost 20 years was when he cut loose at the end of a game and gave referee Mike Dean both barrels. Which doesn’t really count because it was referee Mike Dean, a fabled attention-seeker who probably deserved both barrels.On Tuesday, while everyone else was taking to Social Media Disgrace Twitter to rage about Donald Trump’s mass order of “hamberders”, the meaningless meaningful Brexit vote and “lazy juorno bais”, Cech posted a tweet announcing his imminent retirement. “This is my 20th season as a professional player and it has been 20 years since I signed my first professional contract, so it feels like the right time to announce that I will retire at the end of this season,” said the player who won 14 major trophies, kept a record 202 Premier League clean sheets and is a four-times Premier League Golden Glove winner. “Having played 15 years in the Premier League and won every single trophy possible, I feel like I have achieved everything I set out to achieve.”And then, the obligatory gag, because he’s also a funny guy. “I will continue to work hard at Arsenal to hopefully win one more trophy this season,” he honked, before announcing he was looking forward to seeing what life holds for him off the pitch. Immediate canonisation and a place in heaven, it seems, so overwhelmingly positive and gushing were the responses to Cech’s big news.A man who would apparently spend his every waking hour helping old ladies across the street whether they wanted to get to the other side or not, it seems Cech never knowingly refused a request for an autograph, selfie or interview when he was not busy keeping the ball from passing him while in goal for Chelsea or Arsenal.

The club are now resigned to being without their talismanic forward in both legs of their Champions League knockout tie against Borussia Dortmund and, should they progress beyond Chelsea, in the Carabao Cup final where Manchester City surely await.The 25-year-old is no stranger to ankle problems having endured time on the sidelines in each of the last three years, missing seven weeks back in the autumn of 2016, after suffering injuries on the joint. However, with Spurs 1-0 up from the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, his absence this time round is particularly untimely, and he is likely to miss at least 11 games while he undertakes his rehabilitation.Mauricio Pochettino is already without Son Heung-Min – potentially until the end of the month – while he plays for South Korea at the Asian Cup, and has ruled out reintroducing Vincent Janssen to the first team. That leaves Lucas Moura, who should return at Fulham this weekend after knee trouble, and Fernando Llorente – who has effectively been available for transfer – as his striker options for the foreseeable future. The club had not anticipated entering the market this month and it remains to be seen if that policy shifts in the wake of Kane’s injury.Spurs potentially have seven Premier League fixtures between now and the start of March, when Arsenal are due at Wembley, together with the tie against the Bundesliga leaders. They play the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge next Thursday, with the final on 24 February. Given that schedule, Kane may have been rested for the FA Cup fourth-round match against Crystal Palace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9845b60fef2ea03f64f470adc8b8bb44c3b51b8b/0_237_4695_2818/master/4695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72efab7d28c22161bcc90fe8cf57b4f7","title":"blackburn v newcastle fa cup third round replay live","story":"Apparently Blackburn’s changes are down to an outbreak of illness.“Is it not typical of the current increasing disrespect of the FA Cup that BBC 5 Live are currently covering some ‘meaningful vote’ rather than the far more important task of a proper build up of this fascinating Third Round tie? The game has gone,” rages Jonathan Denness. Meaningful vote? Is it the X Factor final?Thinking about the team changes for tonight’s game, I wonder why some clubs enter the competition at all (and I’m not only, or even mainly, thinking of Newcastle or Blackburn here). I don’t think entry into the FA Cup is automatic: every club must apply for their place. It’s not even free: it costs £75 to do so. Why bother, if you’re only going to make 10 changes and get knocked out at the earliest opportunity? And when was the last time a top-level club chose not to play in it?Here’s the Press Association’s take on the teams:Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez made eight changes to his starting line-up for the FA Cup third-round replay against Blackburn at Ewood Park.Matt Ritchie, Sean Longstaff and Ciaran Clark were the only survivors from the team that had started Saturday’s 2-1 Premier League loss at Chelsea. Winger Callum Roberts was handed his first Newcastle appearance since making his debut in January 2015. Blackburn’s XI showed five adjustments from their 2-0 Championship win at Millwall, with former Newcastle striker Adam Armstrong among those brought into the side by Tony Mowbray. Some random pre-match reading for you. Nothing to do with this game, either team or the FA Cup, but I wrote it and here it is:That is, I believe, five changes for Blackburn, eight for Newcastle.Team news is in, and this is it:“We just have to prepare ourselves for everything in this game because we are not sure on what is coming,” said Blackburn’s Tony Mowbray about tonight’s test. With Newcastle having changed , eight players and a formation for the first meeting at St James’ Park, nobody but Rafa Benítez and his team knows what kind of side he is likely to put out tonight. “It will be the same idea,” said the Spaniard. “We will look to protect some players and provide some balance. We will try to find the balance with those who played the other day and those who will give us fresh legs.”Newcastle play Cardiff at home on Saturday, an enormously important game for the Premier League’s 18th-placed side, particularly as they have lost to Manchester United and Chelsea in their last two league games and face Manchester City and Tottenham after Neil Warnock’s men. Their focus will surely be on maximising their chances of taking three points from that fixture. “If it was my decision, you might want to win a game and go into Cardiff at home on the back of a win with your centre forward scoring a goal and keeping a clean sheet,” said Mowbray. “Or you might send the kids and not worry about the result and focus on trying to beat Cardiff.”The fact that Benítez has declared that, outside the top six, the only clubs with a chance of winning the Cup are “teams in the middle of the table because they can have a go because they are safe” suggests he’ll go for Option B. He has included Cal Roberts (a 21-year-old winger) and Sean Longstaff (a 21-year-old midfielder), two players who have yet to feature in his first team, in his squad, along perhaps with a few more surprises.A home game against Watford’s second string in round four is at stake. Kick-off is a 7.45pm GMT.

In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, a backstop arrangement that keeps the UK in the customs union and requires Northern Ireland to follow single market rules would prevail until a free-trade agreement is reached that avoids such a frontier.The UK and EU negotiators have agreed the former should honour those commitments it made while a member of the bloc – finally settling on a figure of £39bn.The deal would secure a status quo transition period to negotiate the nature of the future relationship, and during which the UK could begin to make trade deals with third countries.A fraught issue at the outset, an agreement was reached relatively quickly that would see the UK respect the rights of EU citizens who arrive before the end of the transition period, which could be in 2022, and vice versa.The document is accompanied by a political declaration that sketches out the future relationship between the two parties – focusing primarily on trade and security.One approach being seriously considered is a period of negotiation that could be overseen by civil servants, with the aim of testing which of up to six options could command a majority in the Commons.“Olly has been on a mission,” said one Whitehall source. It has not yet been decided whether the government would open the door to direct talks with the Labour leadership over what should happen next – or seek to work through backbench channels, the  understands.Whitehall’s role could reflect that played by senior Cabinet Office civil servants, including the then cabinet secretary, the late Jeremy Heywood, during coalition talks after the 2010 general election, which resulted in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat alliance.MPs could then vote on whatever Brexit plan emerged from the talks as most likely to command majority support – potentially including the Norway-style approach championed by the former Tory minister Nick Boles.However, it is not expected that the process would consider options that involve reversing the referendum result.May has given little indication even to her cabinet that she is willing to consider alternatives to her plan, and if she lost by a narrow margin could still decide to return to Brussels in a bid to tease out more concessions.Tory backbenchers, and some cabinet ministers, would also be likely to react furiously if May made any direct overtures to Labour.11.30am The Commons begins sitting. The first item is questions to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and his ministerial team. These are meant to last 30 minutes but can run slightly over. Then the Labour MP Debbie Abrahams briefly introduces a private member’s bill on public sector supply chains under a 10-minute rule motion.After midday\u0026nbspIf there are no urgent questions or ministerial statements to delay proceedings, the final day of debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal – officially known as section 13(1)(b) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 – begins. It will be opened for the government by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox.Before 7pm\u0026nbspMay will make a final closing speech for the government, appealing for support for her deal.From 7pm\u0026nbspVoting begins. However, before the crucial vote, MPs must vote on the four amendments accepted by the Speaker. One amendment, tabled by the Tory Hugo Swire, has been accepted by the government.At some point between around 7.30pm to 9.30pm\u0026nbspMPs finally vote on the deal, as amended.An amendment tabled by the Conservative backbencher Andrew Murrison is aimed at sending a signal to Brussels that MPs will only accept May’s deal with a time-limited backstop.But if it failed to secure much support, it could suggest May’s next step must be more radical than a tweak to the backstop, if she wanted to secure backing for her deal – and Robbins is helping to examine how she could proceed.May phoned trade union leaders, including Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, last week – a move that both union sources and Jeremy Corbyn’s allies regarded as an attempt to signal a willingness to compromise with Labour.Another source claimed May’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, had warned the prime minister that a permanent customs union would be the Labour leader’s “red line” for entering talks – something she remains reluctant to entertain.Government strategists believe Corbyn wants to avoid being forced into supporting a second referendum – and hope he might seize on the option of helping to shape the Brexit deal instead.Labour sources said they would be wary of entering into any kind of negotiation with the prime minister. Corbyn is likely to press ahead with calling a vote of no confidence in the government immediately if May were defeated on Tuesday night.A Downing Street source said: “If we don’t win the vote tonight, we would have to make some decisions pretty quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936cf791eb8943e2b7d314b9e05e57ab589d8797/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bcdc3f3cd2224dd37ff8d517f32d975","title":"a terrible deal remainers and leavers unite against theresa may brexit plan","story":"Unlikely alliance forms at Westminster opposing PM’s seemingly doomed strategyFollow the day’s political developments – live updatesPeople’s vote and no-deal Brexit supporters stood side-by-side outside parliament on Tuesday afternoon as they joined forces in an odd coalition to oppose Theresa May’s apparently doomed deal to leave the European Union.By 5pm, thousands of pro-European protesters had gathered in a flood-lit Parliament Square for the people’s vote rally, whose campaigners had erected two giant video screens and a stage for the live broadcast of the debate and vote in the House of Commons.It came after an afternoon of protest around Westminster, where activists from both sides of the debate flew placards and made it clear they opposed the deal – while hoping for different outcomes.Among the hundreds of people’s vote protesters who had stood on the patch of grass at the back of Westminster Abbey was Alex Kay, 60, the mayor of Bradford on Avon. Standing with two friends, she said she hoped Tuesday night’s vote on whether to accept the deal would be “the beginning of the end of Brexit.”As they spoke, a phalanx of no-deal supporters came marching into their midst chanting “Bollocks to the EU”, before placing a European Union flag on the floor and setting it alight. The scene was animated but peaceful.Closer to the gates of the palace, Philip Hodson, 60, from Newmarket in Suffolk, stood holding a placard reading: “Uphold our English constitution.”“I hope the outcome will be no deal, and that’s the most important thing,” he said. “We should leave straight away and then Europe will come looking for us for a deal.“The reason this deal should be thrown out is it’s offering £39bn to the EU for nothing. It’s taking away our right to vote in the EU and our veto, while leaving us subject to its rules.“That’s why most remainers and leavers are together … Everybody recognises this is a terrible, terrible deal. A child could get a better deal.”The first speaker of the evening was Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP. She said: “We’ve got a really clear message for the prime minister and I hope she’s listening, because our message is that we will not be blackmailed into accepting her dangerous blindfold Brexit deal.“Our message is we reject her vision of a mean-minded little Britain with our borders closed. Our message is that we are going to stand up in particular for our young people who voted overwhelmingly to remain and who believe our future is in Europe.”The rally overlapped with protests by a number of no-deal Brexit campaigners, who have been active around parliament in recent days. A picture shared online by Vinnie Sullivan, a social media figurehead for the movement, showed several dozen outside a West End pub as they prepared for the evening.In a statement, Sullivan told the : “The will of the west shall not be undermined by plastic politicians, anarchist socialists, abuse defending media or their violent minions. Whatever the decision a no deal is the only way to free a country and a civilisation corrupted by outside entities.”Asked about the presence of opposing activists in Westminster, a spokesman for the People’s Vote campaign said: “There are obviously people on all sides of the debate around parliament today. Everybody’s welcome to come and listen we won’t be turning anybody away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a592760092292a9f9ba31a3b88aaa69d1687d1fa/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=590936f39442b4413dfd775027bf5c40","title":"brexit amendment that might have limited pms losses is rejected","story":"MPs brush aside amendment seeking to address concerns over Irish border backstopThe only amendment to Theresa May’s Brexit deal to be voted on in the Commons has been heavily defeated, after three other amendments selected for votes were unexpectedly pulled at the last minute by the MPs and parties who tabled them.The amendment from the veteran Tory backbencher John Baron, which sought to address MPs’ concerns on the Irish border backstop, was brushed aside by 600 votes to 24.Baron’s amendment stated that if May’s deal was passed, the UK would have the unilateral right to terminate the backstop without the say-so of the EU. This would have gone against the withdrawal agreement with the EU, and so was not supported by the government.It had been due to be the last of four amendments to be voted on, after they were selected by the Speaker, John Bercow, from a dozen on offer. But the other three amendments were pulled by their proposers at the last moment.These were tabled by Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour frontbenchers, seeking to rule out a no-deal departure and condemning May’s plan for not providing “a permanent UK-EU customs union and strong single market deal” a joint effort from the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru calling the deal “damaging for Scotland, Wales and the nations and regions of the UK” and one from the Tory MP Edward Leigh also seeking to limit the backstop.Before the final debate on the deal, another backbench Tory amendment that Downing Street had hoped could limit the extent of May’s likely losses was not selected for a vote.Perhaps the most contentious issue. In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, a backstop arrangement that keeps the UK in the customs union and requires Northern Ireland to follow single market rules would prevail until a free-trade agreement is reached that avoids such a frontier.The UK and EU negotiators have agreed the former should honour those commitments it made while a member of the bloc – finally settling on a figure of £39bn.The deal would secure a status quo transition period to negotiate the nature of the future relationship, and during which the UK could begin to make trade deals with third countries.A fraught issue at the outset, an agreement was reached relatively quickly that would see the UK respect the rights of EU citizens who arrive before the end of the transition period, which could be in 2022, and vice versa.The document is accompanied by a political declaration that sketches out the future relationship between the two parties – focusing primarily on trade and security.That amendment, tabled by the Conservative MP Andrew Murrison and backed by 29 of his colleagues, called for the backstop solution to the Irish border to expire on 31 December 2021 if it came into force, and was seen as a sop to MPs on the issue.While the idea goes against the withdrawal agreement with Brussels, the hope was that if it drew much support it could help the prime minister if she returned to the EU to seek new concessions after losing the vote.Murrison said he was very disappointed that his amendment was not selected. “Speaker Bercow conducts himself to his own entire satisfaction,” he said. “The most decorous thing I can say about his selection or not of amendments today is it’s interesting.”Leigh’s amendment, backed by about a dozen colleagues, sought to limit the scope of the backstop by saying it would be temporary and that international law decreed that the UK could unilaterally end the withdrawal agreement if there was any attempt to extend the backstop beyond 2021.During May’s closing speech in the debate, Leigh intervened to ask if she could back his amendment, but was told the government believed it would not be compatible with the withdrawal agreement under international law.The government was, however, “willing to look at creative solutions” on the backstop, May said. ﻿"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623002b5875a6f169c5bc624264127c2008d3909/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3fd201442f5af407df22b7a73f5b1b9","title":"quiz how well have you been following brexit","story":"As MPs prepare to vote on Theresa May’s deal, test your knowledge of EU withdrawal arcanaIt’s the big day.

She added that she had “no faith in the pairing system”.She said that in July “the Govt stole the vote of new mother”, referring to a previous episode when the Conservative chairman, Brandon Lewis, voted in a crucial Brexit debate despite being paired with the Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson, who was at the time on maternity leave.Other Labour MPs criticised Badenoch’s suggestion that Siddiq’s actions were politically motivated. Louise Haigh demanded that Badenoch make an immediate apology while Diana Johnson said Siddiq was “having to make a point because of the cruel decisions of a male-dominated government whips office”.Siddiq will travel to Westminster to vote in the Brexit debate with her husband. Her office has arranged with the Commons authorities for her to be picked up in a wheelchair, allowing her to be pushed through the ision lobby to ensure her vote is counted.It is theoretically possible for Siddiq to be “nodded through” if she simply makes it on to the Westminster estate – a system whereby a member who is physically unable to make it through the Commons ision lobbies can have their vote counted.But it is understood that Siddiq wants to go through the lobby in person, again because she is concerned that the Conservatives will not honour the system.The Labour backbencher Naz Shah was pushed through the ision lobby in a wheelchair while wearing pyjamas last June, at a time when she was recovering from a serious illness because the Conservatives refused to allow her to be nodded through.On Thursday, John Bercow, the Commons Speaker, said that Siddiq should be allowed to vote by proxy, meaning that her vote be counted in her absence. She would have been the first MP to be allowed to vote in this fashion, but while Conservative sources said a proxy would be offered, this had not taken place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dd138fe2de5e7a4f1a592b53dffc5f1fe864c72/0_0_4017_2410/master/4017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cff827583c665b48f629f8fc96e558","title":"what are you playing at the commons brexit debate in quotes","story":"Some of the more memorable lines from MPs’ debate on Theresa May’s Brexit dealThe Conservative MP Julian Lewis, giving the shortest speech in the debate, lasting just 18 seconds:Because Brexit should mean Brexit and because no-deal is better than this bad deal, I shall vote no, no and no.

She has postponed giving birth by caesarian section to vote.The most significant thing Theresa May said in her speech was what she said to Edward Leigh. (See 6.52pm.) This is what she told him when he asked if she would be supporting his amendment, which would set a deadline for the backstop. (See 2.47pm.)By “alternative proposals”, May was referring to Leigh’s amendment r on the order paper (pdf), which has not been called. I won’t post it in full here, because it is very long, but you can read it on the order paper.Jeremy Corbyn is not the biggest fan of the Fleet Street press, but another consequence of his decision to pull his votes, and accelerating the voting process tonight, is that it will be a lot easier for London newspapers to get stories about the result of the main vote into their first editions.John Bercow invites Jeremy Corbyn to move his amendment. He does not move it.He turns to Ian Blackford. He also decides not to move his amendment.He turns to Edward Leigh. Leigh says, in the light of the positive response he got from May (see 6.52pm), he will not move it.He turns to John Baron and invites him to press his amendment. Baron says he does want a vote. Bercow takes the vote by acclamation (asking MPs to cry “aye” and “no”.) At first he says the noes have it. But Baron and his supporters persist, and Bercow calls a ision.MPs are now voting on the Baron amendment.Corbyn may have decided to pull his vote perhaps because he realises there will be a lot more interest in what happens next. May says MPs are there to serve the people who queued up to vote in the referendum and who put their faith in politicians.She says they have a sacred right to see MPs act in their best interests. She says, with a solemn heart, MPs must discharge their responsibilities.May says a vote against her deal is a vote for “uncertainty, ision and the very real risk of no deal”.The SNP’s Ian Blackford intervenes. He says all the studies show Brexit will make the UK poorer. Will the government extend article 50 and give the people a choice?May says MPs were clear that the result of the referendum would be respected. She repeats the line about a vote against the deal being a vote for “uncertainty, ision and the very real risk of no deal”.May says Corbyn’s speech was like his whole approach to Brexit, “long on critcism, short on coherence”. She mocks the idea that he would be able to get a renegotiation in weeks.She says that in its 2017 election manifesto, Labour said free movement would end. Yet at the weekend, Corbyn said he was not against free movement. She says he is against no deal. But he is also against the backstop, without which there is no deal, she says.She says Corbyn has pursued a cynical course. He has forfeited the right to demand loyalty from Labour MPs who take a more pragmatic view.She says she hopes that MPs opposed to no deal, whose constituents rely on manufacturing jobs, should think hard about rejecting her deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff974224b8172cd4443b3a78a8794ed90ef31258/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fe26fd3085dddd43303ef2a08880abe","title":"can you get mays brexit deal through parliament","story":"Use our simulator to see what happens when each of the various tribes chooses to back the prime minister, to reject her bill or to abstain.

The pre-school app that helps non-English speakers pick up the foundations of the language is now used by more than 10,000 families in 50 countriesWhen Toby Mather travelled to Russia in 2013 to teach English to primary school children, it was made clear that the school expected results – and fast. But that expectation didn’t match up to the realities of teaching. “Even when you get a really great, passionate teacher, you can’t turn 30 children in a room into great English speakers with just one hour a week. And you especially can’t do it if they’re starting at the age of seven,” he says.The experience inspired Mather to do two things. First, to further indulge his passion and talent for teaching, and second, to give children a foundation in English before they even step into a classroom. “There is a huge drop in a child’s capacity to acquire a second language when they hit six years of age,” he says. “I thought it was a massive shame that they are not starting at the age of, say, four.” But, he needed a solution that was affordable, easy to use, and could be done at home without a private language tutor.When he returned to London, Mather met Adit Trivedi at tech accelerator Entrepreneur First. In 2015, they came up with the idea for Lingumi, an English language learning platform for pre-schoolers, that is now used by more than 10,000 families in 50 countries.Learning English is a long journey for anyone – even native speakers take years to become what Mather describes as “professional”. But children, whose brains are like sponges until they are about six years old, have the ability to pick up a second language – and the confidence to speak it – as if it was their first.Trivedi knows this first-hand – growing up in a non-native English-speaking home, he learned to speak both Gujarati and English. Throughout his life, years would go by when he would speak only English but it would take just hours of being immersed in Gujarati for him to be speaking it conversationally again. Both Trivedi and Mather’s personal insights into how children learn and the impact this can have on them later in life have been a key influence in the development of Lingumi as a platform.Lingumi learning is based on an app, which allows toddlers and their parents to participate in a single 20-minute lesson per day. The children are encouraged to learn natural, spoken English with their parent (rather than reading or writing), where single words are gradually built upon to create more complex phrases over the course of the curriculum.A particular challenge of building the platform has been making sure it’s suitable for its target audience – pre-school-age kids. “How do you resonate language goals in your app to a two- or three-year-old? How do you build something that’s truly fun and engaging, but inevitably and fundamentally teaches English?” says Trivedi.One of the things the pair have kept in mind is that they’re not building a tool for children to become completely fluent in English. Rather, they’re aiming to give them a foundation for when they do start learning the language at school. Mather says giving children these tools can have lifelong benefits.To get the platform to this point, Mather and Trivedi have gone through dozens of iterations, starting with physical products that could be used alongside the app – including a toy cube with characters on each side, who corresponded to the app’s games.“We would even go as far as going to Hyde Park Winter Wonderland for five days straight and literally hustle customers to try and test these products,” says Trivedi. But, in order to integrate voice detection, recording games, and more complex grammar systems, the pair made the difficult decision to abandon the toy and move to a digital-first approach. “It was a bit like using the paint program on an old Windows computer and trying to draw the Mona Lisa,” says Mather.The results for Mather and Trivedi, however, have been even better than expected. “I couldn’t believe how early they started saying words and how native their accents sounded,” says Mather.They both have big ambitions for Lingumi. “It has the technology, the price points, and the value to get to a billion customers,” says Trivedi. While most of the 10,000 to 15,000 users a month are located within Germany, Italy and Taiwan, the next step is pushing Lingumi to the Chinese market. “We’re seeing a spread into new countries: China, France, Spain, South America,” says Trivedi. “Our aim is to create the biggest pre-school education company in the world.”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

Experts share their top tips to improve efficiency and productivityRachael Dines admits she never planned on working for herself, but after being made redundant while pregnant, she began working as a marketing consultant from home. “My husband bought me a laptop and I would literally sit on the sofa and try to run the business,” she says. “That didn’t lead to great productivity. Everything was overlapping with my home life, you’re easily distracted. There are just so many things that can interrupt your day.”Part of the reason for that, Graham Allcott, director at productivity training provider Think Productive, says, may be a misconception around flexible working that’s still evident in some businesses. “I think most companies are still very stuck in this idea that it’s five days a week, 9am-5pm in an office, and you need to be in,” Allcott says.Clare Evans, productivity coach and author of Time Management for Dummies, believes flexible working can really boost morale among the team if the trust is there. “When people work from home, they have much more control over their working hours. Whether they start earlier, finish later, work around family, and other priorities they might have.” For her, it’s important for home workers to have a dedicated space to work from, to have the right technology and to set parameters for the day – including working hours and daily objectives. “Avoid multitasking – focus on one thing at a time,” she says, adding that hanging out washing and other household chores can be left to an appropriate break. She’s also found the Pomodoro technique – breaking work intervals into 25 minutes, followed by a five-minute break, can help maintain focus. “It’s important to take breaks wherever you’re working. Finish one task before getting on with the next one.”Allcott recommends starting the day with some sort of a commute to optimise productivity, even if it’s just walking around the block to buy milk, or taking the dog out. “Get some fresh air and have a transition – you’re getting ready for work, you’re walking to work, now you’re at work,” he says. Most people are at their most attentive in the morning, so this is the best time to address difficult projects, rather than just answering emails that have come in overnight. “The trick is to ignore some of that latest and loudest stuff, and focus on the deeper, more important stuff,” he adds. He’s also found it helps being accountable to someone else, even if it’s just an email you promised to send at a certain time, or a task you had committed to finish on a particular day.After six years of freelancing, Dines launched the marketing and design agency Shake It Up Creative with co-director Meg Fenn in 2015. Though she’s had to make a conscious effort to stay focused while working remotely, she says it has definitely helped make her days more productive. She now leaves the couch for non-work related laptop time, in favour of setting up a proper work space in a separate room, always dresses for work (this might include jeans, but never jogging bottoms or pyjamas) and has become really strict with herself about scheduling her work day. “I definitely work harder now than I did when I was in an office,” she adds.SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

Here they describe their ups and downs, and having their children as chief taste testersOne Saturday morning, when Kevin Bath was having breakfast with his family – wife Kellie and children Evie (12) and Jack (eight) – he casually glanced at the label of the jar of chocolate spread his children were enthusiastically spreading on their toast. He was horrified. The spread contained the equivalent of 57 sugar cubes in a standard jar. Kevin and Kellie decided there must be a healthier option, and the idea for their business, JimJams, was born.Within months the couple had quit their jobs – Kevin, as an IT consultant at the London Stock Exchange and Kellie, who was running her own health business – to focus on their new venture. “We realised there was a gap in the market for a healthy alternative to chocolate spreads,” says Kevin. “Neither of us had any prior experience of the food industry or developing and marketing such a product, but we knew we had to do something. It was a very big leap of faith.”The concept was simple: to develop a chocolate spread with significantly less sugar than the leading brands, but without any compromise on taste. “We had no idea where to start, so we began by contacting manufacturers within the UK and Europe to ask if they would develop a spread for us to sample,” Kellie says. “We held taste-testing sessions around our kitchen table with our friends and family – our kids were chief taste testers – and then took samples to food shows. The feedback enabled us to perfect the final recipe.”The consumer response has been phenomenal, says Kevin. “We appeal mainly to the family market, but we’ve also been attracting younger, more health-conscious consumers. The fact we use a naturally sourced sweetener means it’s kinder on teeth, has less effect on blood glucose levels, contains fewer calories, and is also gluten-free.”Their success, however, has not come easy. “Ignorance, as they say, is bliss, which is just as well, because if we had known just how turbulent the ride was going to be, I’m not sure we would have actually gone for it,” says Kellie. “But I’m so glad we did.”The couple rented a local storage unit and used their personal savings to develop the product, design their branding and tour a few food shows, before the money almost ran out. “We had about four or five months where we didn’t know how we were going to pay the mortgage,” says Kellie. “It was really stressful.”Fortunately, Kevin saw an advertisement for the Grocery Accelerator programme, which invests in new food and drinks brands, and applied for funding. They were shortlisted out of 100 companies and secured investment of £90,000.By that time, they had also found a manufacturer that could deliver, but there were still a number of obstacles to overcome. “They didn’t deal in small product runs. In fact, their minimum order requirement was huge!” Kellie explains. “We had just enough money left to place one order and we only had a handful of potential customers at the time. It was a big risk, but it paid off.”They then approached some local Co-op stores, speciality food stores and independent retailers. It wasn’t long before the business started to take off.“Morrisons was the first supermarket we approached and it was an amazing feeling when they said yes to the product,” says Kevin. “We’d made it simple by offering them a solution – a healthier alternative to a product they were already selling and one that would bring them new customers.”Ocado and Sainsbury’s soon followed, and the couple also recently signed up with the Publix supermarket chain in the US, as well as launching a new 15g portion pot. “The 15g pots are now available in Center Parcs and we have just completed a very successful trial with Hilton Hotels,” says Kellie. “Fingers crossed you will see them in every Hilton very soon. We’re also launching a milk chocolate dipper, and are in final negotiations with a major retailer and Merlin Entertainment.”Despite their success, Kellie says they never stop worrying. “It’s a constant battle. Each time we secure a new retailer, it feels great, but we don’t have time to process it because we’re always moving on to the next thing. We’d get a win and then we’d lose something. We’d think we’d secured something and then the retailer would pull out unexpectedly. So we’re constantly on our toes.”One of the best things about working together and running their own business is, says Kellie, the flexibility is has given them. “I work four days a week, so that I can still be there to help with the children’s homework and catch up with the housework etc,” she says.Kevin says he was usually out the door at 7:30am every morning when he worked in the City but that, since they launched JimJams, he’s able to take his son to football after school each week and be there to do the school run.They hope they are also setting a good example to their children by running their own business. “Jack was with me in Sainsbury’s the other day and he gasped when he saw our spreads on the shelf,” says Kellie. “He asked if he was famous! I would like them to experience running their own business one day, just because it is an amazing way to build self-belief and instils such a strong work ethic. I want them to know that they can achieve anything they set their mind to, and being a role model is the most powerful way to show them it is possible.”Kevin and Kellie are clearly partners in business and in life. “I love the fact that we can celebrate our wins together and we both understand the pressures of the business,” Kellie says. “Some people probably thought we were a bit mad when Kevin left his job in the City to sell chocolate spread, but we hope to prove them wrong.”SEAT believes in helping people move forward.

It comes at a time when physicists around the world are considering where to build the next cutting-edge particle collider, with other machines under discussion in Japan and China.Fabiola Gianotti, the director general of Cern, called the latest proposal “a remarkable accomplishment”. “It shows the tremendous potential of the FCC to improve our knowledge of fundamental physics and to advance many technologies with a broad impact on society,” she said.Under the plans, the machine would be built up in stages. At first it would collide electrons and positrons, their positive cousins. Then it would collide electrons with much heavier nuclei of lead atoms. By the late 2050s, it would slam protons together with an energy of 100 teraelectronvolts, or nearly 10 times that of the Large Hadron Collider.The subatomic debris thrown out by the collisions could potentially give scientists the chance to study the Higgs particle with unprecedented precision, and create new particles that have so far evaded observation.Peter Higgs predicted the existence of what became known as the Higgs boson in 1964. But the mysterious particle which confers mass on the building blocks of matter was not discovered until 2012 when physicists spotted the telltale signs of its creation in the LHC. The discovery led to the Nobel prize for Peter Higgs the following year.Plans for the FCC, along with other proposals, will now go forward to an international panel of scientists who will consider them as part of a new European strategy for particle physics which is due to be published in 2020.There is no guarantee the machine will be built. In 1993, the US scrapped the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, a machine somewhat smaller than the FCC, after spending $2bn (£1.5bn) on the machine. In December, plans to build a $7bn International Linear Collider in Japan ran into trouble when an influential science committee concluded the cost was too high.Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University, said that the FCC would be unlikely to suffer the same fate as the Superconducting Super Collider. “If the money can be found credibly to start the project, then I am convinced that Cern would build it successfully,” he said.“Ideally an FCC-like project would be a catalyst to found a true world laboratory, which is the obvious next step. After all, Cern is now clearly unofficially the world’s particle physics lab,” Foster added. “This wouldn’t mean that Asian countries or the US would cease to have their own regional programmes: the majority of US physicists are already involved in the LHC.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6c50a132fcd7df7602726caae75995174433e33/0_0_3912_2348/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c3e9f357261141e4e300d7c1eeb92d","title":"benefit rule changes could cost pensioners in uk thousands a year pension credit","story":"From 15 May, new pensioners with partners under 65 can no longer claim pension creditThousands of poorer UK pensioners who have partners of working age could lose up to £7,000 a year in top-ups as a result of imminent rule changes that will require them to claim universal credit as a couple.Changes slipped out on Monday night by the Department for Work and Pensions mean that from 15 May, new pensioners whose partners are younger than the state retirement age of 65 can no longer claim a means-tested top-up called pension credit.Instead they will be forced to claim the much less generous universal credit alongside their younger partners.The couple rate of universal credit is £114.81 a week compared with £255.25 for a couple receiving pension credit. This amounts to a potential loss of £7,320 a year.Age UK described the change as a “substantial stealth cut” and said it could have a devastating effect on the health and wellbeing of some older people and increase the numbers of pensioners in poverty.Caroline Abrahams, charity director, said: “It is by no means unusual for one partner to be slightly older than the other within relationships and the bigger the age gap between them, the more long-lasting the adverse impact on them will be because of this proposed change.“That’s why this government policy has been dubbed ‘the toy boy tax’ by some – but that’s not to trivialise the really serious impact it is likely to have on anyone unlucky enough to be subjected to it. For some, the impact will be truly devastating. The government should think again.”The scale of the potential losses faced by couples could put pressure on existing relationships, say experts, and may persuade them that they cannot afford to marry or move in together.The average age gap for mixed-age couples is 2.6 years, meaning the cash loss incurred before the younger partner becomes old enough to claim pension credit could be £19,000. Where the gap is greater the potential total lost will be more.Age UK said pensioners may find themselves in the “absurd position” of being financially better off if they split up and live apart from their partner.A single person who claims the top-up is eligible for £167.25 a week in pension credit, meaning that in theory a pensioner will be better off staying “solo” for benefit purposes rather than claiming with a partner.Gareth Morgan, a benefits expert, said a single person getting pension credit who forms a relationship with a person of working age would lose their entitlement to that benefit and would have to claim universal credit as a couple.However, if they were to separate again, even if they remained living in the same home but as separate households, their total incomes would increase substantially. This is because a single person’s pension credit combined with a single person’s universal credit amounts to more than a couple’s universal credit payment.“It would be surprising if the DWP didn’t have to make substantial numbers of assessments about the genuineness of relationship breakdowns,” said Morgan.Currently, people who reach retirement age and are eligible can claim pension credit regardless of the age of their partner. In future they will have to wait until their partner also reaches 65, although the state retirement age will be increased to 66 in October 2020.Couples with one partner under state pension age who are already in receipt of pension credit will be unaffected. But they will be moved to the new system if their circumstances change, such as a change of address, or even if the pensioner partner goes abroad for longer than a month.If a mixed-age couple claim universal credit, the pensioner partner will not be required to look for work as a condition, unlike working-age claimants. The government says the younger partner’s claimant conditions will be tailored to meet the couple’s circumstances.The pension credit change has been in place since the Welfare Reform Act 2012, but ministers put off its introduction until universal credit was fully rolled out. Last month universal credit moved into every Jobcentre Plus area of the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13484aaf9fe8e016470af9849aec62d2dab007d2/0_140_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed4f4f210aa2f5b487f5aeb572740aab","title":"disability benefits reform costs government 4bn in extra welfare payments","story":"OBR’s figures will bolster disability groups’ calls for overhaul of PIP systemChanges to the disability benefits system that has caused huge hardship to some of the country’s most vulnerable people has cost the government more than £4bn more in extra welfare payments than ministers estimated.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the Treasury’s independent forecasting unit, said predictions by the Department for Work and Pensions dramatically under-estimated the costs of rolling out the personal independent payments (PIP) system, which began to replace disability living allowance (DLA) in 2013.A saving of £2bn was expected by 2018, but that has since been revised to an over-spend by £1.5bn to £2bn, leaving an estimated £4.2bn gap in the public finances.The figures are expected to bolster calls by disability groups for an overhaul of the PIP system, which has been described as a “vicious attack” on disabled people. MPs on the work and pensions select committee concluded an investigation last year that found the assessments of claimants by private sector contractors to be “shoddy and error strewn”, leading to hundreds of thousands of successful appeals.One charity, Parkinson’s UK, complained that about a quarter of people living with the disease in Britain had lost some or all of their support after benefit reassessments, only to have the payments reinstated on appeal.The OBR said the growing number of appeals was one of several causes of the unexpected rise in costs. It said the system had also come under pressure from legal challenges, which had altered the scope of the scheme, and an increase in claimants, especially of working age adults when this group was due to see a large fall.Ministers claimed, when the system was launched, that a programme of rolling medical assessments by three private sector contractors would ensure payments were only made for as long as a claimant needed them.Critical of the system run by public sector staff, the DWP expected that independent medical reassessments would lead to a dramatic fall in the number of people staying on benefits.Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said: “DWP told us PIP would save taxpayers money and introduce a fair, transparent assessment process. Today’s report lays bare that it has achieved neither. PIP will cost a fifth more than the system it replaces: a sorry situation largely thanks to DWP’s failure to cost the reform accurately before bringing it in.“Far worse, though, is that the PIP assessments are riddled with repeated and serious errors and have caused untold anxiety and misery for far too many of the people who rely on the benefit to live. The cost of those mistakes is also knocked forward into the tribunal system, not back to the contractors who made them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a16258fb947954d320cb150f89c1abe26ce5dc1/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9836f3b5bb0cfd80d41636b1d75426","title":"theresa may left behind britain leave voting funds","story":"City versus town? It might seem a facile debate in a small country where the interests of both should be aligned. What’s the difference, apart from size? Quite a lot, actually. For the past few decades, lobbying by a group of large cities has placed big population centres at the forefront of what remains of urban policy. Larger cities were seen as the engines of growth, portrayed as the economic saviours for surrounding communities. A contestable point, certainly. But these cities found a welcoming ear in government.The government responded with devolution deals to create combined authorities, led by mayors, in six city-regions, including Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Merseyside. But Theresa May went cool on the idea, instead preferring to reinvigorate “Brexit Britain”: those places which voted leave in June 2016. The PM even popped into a village up the hill from my Tyneside home to reassure the north (62 of the 73 local authority areas in northern England voted leave) that she was determined to deliver equity across the country: “It is my mission to make sure that ... no community is left behind as we plan both our domestic agenda and our Brexit strategy,” she said.Domestic agenda? Dream on. Few, if any, policies – aside, ironically, from EU funding – are in place to address deep-seated problems such as unemployment, vacant and partly abandoned town centres, and poor housing in these “left-behind” places that time, and governments, have largely forgotten. Yet in the north alone, these non-metropolitan areas have a population of 6.3 million. What’s more, a commitment to replace EU regional funding, used to help revive collapsing economies and communities in run-down areas (worth £1.2bn annually) with a “shared prosperity fund” has been kicked into the long grass. A government spokesman told Society  ministers recognised the importance of reassuring communities on the future of such funding, post-Brexit. Hence, they were making progress in designing a new system.But domestic government has ground to a halt. The “left-behind” areas remain sidelined. Civil servants speak despairingly of “strategy stasis”. The state, nationally and locally, has been hollowed out. Swaths of the country are being hammered by the continuing impact of austerity on local councils. Research by economic geographers at Cambridge University underlines how town halls in the poorest parts of England, mainly in the north, have been hit disproportionately by the deepest spending cuts – with yet more to come – while the south has generally been treated much more leniently. So much for the PM’s pledge to end austerity.In 2017, frustrated by government inaction, the Town and Country Planning Association (of which I’m a former chair) and Newcastle University held a conference to address the challenges facing these “left-behind areas”. Alasdair Rae, a leading mapping geographer at the University of Sheffield, pointed out that these areas are wrongly viewed as the UK equivalent of the rust belt in the US, whereas they should be more accurately labelled a “necklace of neglect”, long-forgotten by a metropolitan elite obsessed with boosting big city economies. Meanwhile, Andy Pike, a regional specialist at Newcastle University, argued that an obsession with boosting “city centrism” has failed to provide a “spillover” to peripheral towns. “Growing disparities ... suggest that the wider spread of benefits have not reached the people and places left behind or sufficiently connected them to central urban prosperity,” he said.Naming these places can be invidious. But from west Cumbria, to east Durham, South Yorkshire to the Potteries, East Lancashire to the West Midlands and seaside towns, there are plenty of places – starved of council resources compounded by government inaction – with potential for renewal. Sometimes local endeavour is working wonders. Once governments could respond with a range of initiatives and organisations to partner these places, from a national regeneration body to nine regional development agencies and specific government offices in eight regions plus London. All have been abolished.Something has to give. How about a new, national department for the regions to coordinate strategy and address the left-behind places? Even active government might be a start.

The closest the 2018 grand-slam winners Ireland came to defeat was at the Stade de France when Jonathan Sexton’s drop goal with the countdown clock at zero pinched victory.“I think we’ve got a great chance of winning the Six Nations if we win that opening game, which is going to be our toughest,” said Gatland, who has steered Wales to third in the world rankings from 10th when he took over after the 2007 World Cup. “We feel in as good a position as anybody to do well.”Wales follow Paris with a trip to Rome and rather than fly home after the France match they will travel to Nice where they will have a five-day training camp before going to Italy. Their two home matches, against England and Ireland, are interrupted by a trip to Murrayfield, a ground where Gatland has never lost with Wales having been on sabbatical with the Lions when Scotland won two years ago.“There’s a lot of positivity and confidence in Ireland,” said Gatland. “Their provincial teams are doing well in Europe our teams haven’t been so good which is a little bit disappointing. Ireland should be talking themselves up and being confident.”Gatland on Tuesday named a 39-man squad for the tournament. It is larger than normal because a number of players will arrive at camp next week nursing injuries, including the full-back Leigh Halfpenny, who is following return-to-play protocols following the concussion he suffered playing against Australia in November, the outside-half Dan Biggar, who suffered a knee ligament injury playing for Northampton at Clermont Auvergne last weekend, the back rower Ross Moriarty, who is also recovering from concussion, and the second row Adam Beard, who has a neck problem.“We will monitor them all closely and hope they will be fit for the second game if not the first,” said Gatland, who will be without back rowers Taulupe Faletau, Dan Lydiate, Ellis Jenkins and James Davies for most if not all of the tournament and is taking a first look at the Wasps flanker Thomas Young, who won his two caps to date in the summer of 2017 when Gatland was in New Zealand with the Lions.Wales had their most successful autumn campaign, winning all four matches, with World Cup group rivals Australia and South Africa among their victims. They have won their last nine Tests, two short of their record, set in 1910. The last team to beat them in Cardiff was New Zealand in 2017.“It’ll be interesting to see what happens to us when the players come in in terms of self-belief and confidence,” said Gatland, referring to their setbacks at regional level after the success of the autumn. “The autumn was great, but it was not about points. It is important that we are thinking about tournament rugby, which is what we are going to experience in Japan in the World Cup.”Wales will be captained by the 120-cap second-row Alun Wyn Jones, the one survivor in the squad from Gatland’s first team against England at Twickenham 11 years ago. There are no uncapped players but nine have won 50 caps or more, eight of them Lions.“The whole thing about Six Nations is the momentum,” said Gatland. “If you can win your first couple of games, you have a great chance of being in contention on the last weekend. Alun Wyn will be essential for us over the next few months. The Ospreys have been fantastic in the way they have managed his playing time and both they and Wales are getting the best out of him.”Gatland said Halfpenny, who is unlikely to be involved on the opening two weekends after seeing a concussion specialist, would not play until he was deemed ready. “He’s been advised to continue training. If he’s right, he’ll be in contention but if not, we’ll have to make other plans.”Nathan Hughes has signed a three-year deal with Bristol that will see him leave Wasps at the end of the season.The Fijian-born England number eight has been an integral part of the Wasps pack since arriving from Auckland in 2013 but has opted to depart the Coventry-based club for the 2019-20 campaign.“Nathan is a quality rugby player who brings physicality, power and brute strength to our game,” Bristol head coach Pat Lam said.

Acosta will take up his appointment in January 2020, succeeding the current director, David Bintley, who stands down at the end of the current season in July.Acosta said it was “a tremendous honour and privilege” to have been appointed as new director of “one of the country’s leading classical ballet companies.“My ambition is to build on its classical traditions, to expand its repertoire and to reach out to new and more erse audiences. I want to define what it is to be a world-leading classical ballet company in the 21st century.”Acosta, for 17 years a principal at the Royal Ballet, is regarded as one of the greatest dancers in the world and has a remarkable rags-to-riches life story.The youngest of 11 children, he was born and brought up in one of the poorest districts in Havana and frequently skipped school. He was effectively forced in to ballet by his father, a lorry driver, to keep him off the streets and out of trouble.Acosta trained at the National Ballet School of Cuba before leaving to gradually build his stellar dance career with many of the world’s leading ballet companies.He bade farewell to Covent Garden in 2015 but continued to dance with his company Acosta Danza, most recently appearing at the Royal Albert Hall last October in a mixed bill celebrating his 30-year career.Sir David Normington, the chair of Birmingham Royal Ballet, said it was a great moment for the company. “We have secured the greatest male dancer of his generation to be our new director,” he said. “I know he will bring us his legendary artistry, energy and charisma and enable us to connect with new audiences, particularly in Birmingham.“It is a statement to the whole dance world that, building on David Bintley’s great legacy, Birmingham Royal Ballet intends to remain a major force for classical ballet in the UK and beyond.”Birmingham Royal Ballet is based at the Birmingham Hippodrome. It was originally established as Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, a touring sister company to the Royal Ballet, before relocating to Birmingham and changing its name in 1990.Like other arts organisations in Birmingham it is facing further deep cuts in its budget from one of its principal funders, the cash-strapped Birmingham city council.The appointment of Acosta was welcomed by Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council England. He said: “Birmingham Royal Ballet is an exceptional company, with an international reputation for the artistic quality of its work.“We look forward to seeing Carlos build on this legacy, and to the company continuing to delight audiences with their array of classical and groundbreaking ballets.”Acosta is known for being warm and refreshingly down-to earth.

His idea was that Channing could play the maid, Sabina (who is also a vamp), while doubling as the everywoman housewife Mrs Antrobus. It was her voice he wanted, the way it could flip from husk to squeak to a honk so basso that it became a plot point in the 1967 film Thoroughly Modern Millie, in which Channing starred opposite Julie Andrews.Channing had her own number in Millie: Jazz Baby, a 1919 hit that opens “My daddy was a ragtime trombone player”, which perfectly showcased her genius for the comedy slide – a gift of her vocal range – and even more her delivery. Listen to her stretch and rasp the “a” and the “zz” in “jazz”, a vocalisation so wild that the film’s scriptwriters gave her the word “raspberry” as a dialogue keynote – she drawls it across many frames.You wonder what 1940s Broadway made of Channing, who wasn’t going to turn out a steam-powered belter in the manner of Ethel Merman, real-homespun like Mary Martin or cool-funny like Eve Arden, whom she understudied. (All three later took stints as post-Channing Dollies.) Her lollipop head and muscular arms were unusual for the period, as was her voice for Broadway, with its often black-edged styling – one of Channing’s grandmothers was African American, although the influence was more perhaps her favourite performers, especially Ethel Waters’s mix of sexuality with energetic absurdity.She was a character-player trying for lead roles. In her first Broadway success, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949), she used the comedy of her growled vowels to keep her jazz age gold-digger (well, diamond-collector) Lorelei Lee on the sweet side of sleaze. If sugar daddies happened by, it wasn’t the fault of just a little girl from Little Rock. Playing Dolly, she barely descended into boom, even in When the Parade Passes By, written for Merman-level foghorn delivery. Channing, instead, worked a sadness in her husky middle voice.Want a real treat? Listen to Channing as Mehitabel the Shinbone Alley cat, muse to Eddie Bracken’s Archy the poetic cockroach, on a 1954 musical concept LP take on the writings of the humourist Don Marquis, titled Archy and Mehitabel. Her mog enters to muted trumpet with a honky-tonk intonation she trumpets herself with a nasal jazz delivery when Archy thwarts her intention that her kittens should drown. But also: “I’m a lady still” she purrs, then miaows “Toujours gai.” What a one-off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24d1fc6d2626a91014970d78889cbd024960d83c/0_221_4584_2750/master/4584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98617a5cafaf0ba32a4f6e202a42cb8d","title":"stop and search review arcola london","story":"Arcola, LondonGabriel Gbadamosi’s oblique new play follows three encounters, but too many layers of intrigue throw it off courseThe title is misleading: this isn’t really a play about police searches, although a couple of coppers do pop up. Actually, there are a fair few misleading elements in Irish-Nigerian Gabriel Gbadamosi’s oblique new work. Three crisscrossing stories kick off in a car speeding towards Calais, and end abruptly in a taxi winding through south London. An African refugee bookends the play and a ghostly presence lurks at the scenes’ edges. But there are too many layers of obscurity and the intrigue gives way to frustration.Director Mehmet Ergen eventually loses control of Gbadamosi’s writing but the opening scene is eerie and unsettling. Two car seats, which might have been neatly thrown from a crash, sit on Eleanor Bull’s gravel-strewn set. An angry white man, Tel (Shaun Mason, set to blow), and an African refugee, Akim (Munashe Chirisa), are driving through a tunnel, the world pressing down on them. Tel rages about his life, while Akim remains still and quiet. Every once in a while, Akim remembers refugees drowning and loved ones in flames. These are the memories that stay with Akim, wherever he goes.In a baffling middle section, entitled Good Cop Bad Cop, David Kirkbride and Tyler Luke Cunningham play two sergeants – one restless and one calm – waiting for a criminal to return home. Kirkbride has a sinister energy about him but the scene falls flat. Gbadamosi’s writing keeps snagging on eclectic details: one of the cops is transgender and another has prostate issues. All very interesting, perhaps, but in a play this obscure it is mostly just distracting.The final scene unfolds in a taxi, with Akim now in the driver’s seat. Connections emerge between all three encounters but it feels a little laboured. Far too much energy is spent teasing us about who might be speaking and how the different characters are connected, rather than really grappling with what this play is trying to say. Despite all this, there is a strange wisdom about Chirisa’s quietly composed Akim.

Both were murdered at the age of 47 on 15 January 100 years ago. Someone had left a note in a shaky hand that read “Peace, bread, roses, freedom”. People wiped away tears as they laid their flowers.The anniversary of the state-sanctioned murders of the founders of the Communist party of Germany (KPD) brought an estimated 20,000 people on to the streets of Berlin at the weekend for a march that marked the high point of a series of commemorative events, including theatre performances, readings and new biographies.Although Liebknecht is held in high regard, it is Luxemburg who has been stealing the limelight. Not least, according to Mark Jones – assistant professor at University College Dublin and a leading expert on the German revolution of 1918-19 that culminated in the murders – because “she was a high achiever who rose in the very male-dominated world of Social Democratic politics”.She was considered a great orator and a prolific writer, cherished today by her leftwing supporters due to her opposition to the first world war and her fight for the rights of the working class, as well as the fact that her early death meant her reputation was not blemished by later disillusionments with the communist dream. Her name retains its popularity as a choice for her supporters’ female offspring.Luxemburg’s slogans, along with portraits of her and Liebknecht, were held high on the red banners clutched by people as they made their way along the former Stalin Allee in eastern Berlin on Sunday, with hearty renditions of the Internationale and other revolutionary songs blaring out of portable speakers.“Of course, the brutal and sudden end to her story raises the question of what would have happened if she had survived,” said Jones. “At its most advanced and powerful, the Rosa Luxemburg myth claims that had she lived, National Socialism may have never taken control of Germany.”That was a view held by many at the demonstration. “I do believe the Nazis might not have come to power and history might well have taken a different turn had Rosa been able to fulfil her wishes,” said Kit Aastrup, a retired social worker who had taken a bus from Aarhus in Denmark to join the march. She wore a Russian ushanka ear-flap hat, embossed with a hammer and sickle. A group calling themselves the “Yellow Vests”, a nod to France’s gilet jaunes movement, held a banner across the width of the street that read: “Remembering Karl and Rosa in 2019 means showing solidarity with the ‘yellow vests’.”Uwe Hiksch, a member of the opposition Die Linke, or Left party, which sees itself as the natural inheritor of Luxemburg’s legacy, guides tourists around the Berlin landmarks connected to the murders. A recent tour took in the site of Eden, the hotel where Luxemburg and Liebknecht were brought by demobilised former soldiers, known as Freikorps to be beaten and shot. It continues to the location where Luxemburg’s body was thrown into the canal, and, a few hundred metres away, the Neuen See lake where Liebknecht was shot and killed.When the Freikorps came to arrest her, Luxemburg was reading Goethe’s Faust. “She thought she was going to be taken to prison, she had no idea she was going to be murdered, so she brought a suitcase of books with her,” Hiksch said.Far from uniting Germany’s left, the murders created a deep ide, still felt keenly today in the animosities that exist between the Social Democratic party (SPD), the junior coalition partner to Angela Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democrats, and Die Linke, successors to the communist party that ruled East Germany.Recently, Andrea Nahles became the first leader of the SPD to come close to admitting her party’s role in the revolutionaries’ deaths, amid evidence that Gustav Noske, the minister of defence in the SPD-led fledgling Weimar government at the time, effectively signed off on the murders in an effort to crush the far left.“It is probable that Gustav Noske had a hand in the murders of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht,” she told the party faithful in November at an event to discuss the 1919 revolt.Noske was later involved in the farcical trials that followed the murders and that led to the acquittal of all but two of the suspects, who received paltry sentences.“The SPD has a very difficult relationship with the 1918-19 revolution,” said Jones. “While various party historians openly admit the SPD’s role in the events, others still want to defend it.”Even now, he said, Die Linke supporters argued that just as the SPD betrayed the working class then, so it continued to do with its labour reforms, seen as punishing the working class.The London writer David Fernbach was among those who came to Berlin to pay tribute to Luxemburg and Liebknecht. His grandfather, Wolfgang, was a member of the Spartacus League, the Marxist revolutionary movement founded by Luxemburg and Liebknecht in reaction to the SPD’s support for the first world war. Wolfgang was murdered by government troops on 11 January 1919, when he was 30.“Luxemburg made a huge contribution to the positive sides of German socialism at a time when it was free from the dogmatisms that were to follow, which is why I think she remains something of an untainted socialist icon today,” Fernbach said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dbee4dac49766bf01ac8d53e593a76a849ab209/0_69_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47ca700ed992b29d5a4ebcfeaadad898","title":"toto africa desert installation play for all eternity","story":"Namibian-German artist Max Siedentopf set up an installation of six speakers that play Africa by Toto on an infinite loop in an undisclosed spot Somewhere amid the sand dunes of the world’s oldest desert croons a soft voice: “It’s gonna take a lot to take me away from you.”The voice belongs to Joseph Williams, lead singer for the American band Toto, whose hit song Africa has been indefinitely tethered to an undisclosed spot in the Namib coastal desert thanks to Namibian-German artist Max Siedentopf.The artist set up an installation called Toto Forever made up of six speakers attached to a blue MP3 player – whose only song is Africa set to play on an infinite loop – all standing atop white rectangular blocks set up in the sand. The installation, Siedentopf writes on his website, runs on solar batteries “to keep Toto going for all eternity”.The song was released in 1982, but it has been dubbed “the internet’s favorite song” with hundreds of thousands of fans across the web. The music video has 442m views on YouTube, while Spotify said that Africa plays doubled in 2018 compared to the previous year. A bot on Twitter that is dedicated to tweeting out the song’s lyrics has well over 50,000 followers. Weezer famously made a cover of the song last year, and Pitbull’s sampling of the song was featured on the Aquaman soundtrack. Even scientists have joked it is the best song ever made.Though Africa is named after the continent, the song has turned more into a soothing anthem for Americans that speaks to the ideals of Africa. Jeff Porcaro, the late co-writer of the song and drummer for Toto, described the idea of the song as “a white boy is trying to write a song on Africa, but since he’s never been there, he can only tell what he’s seen on TV or remembers in the past”.Siedentopf said he considers the tribute worthwhile because Toto has “made a song that is understood and liked all over the world”, he wrote to the . He considers any reaction to the installation, even negative ones, a compliment.“If no one hates it, no one will love it,” Siedentopf wrote. “I think having the worst sound installation is more interesting than just a mediocre installation.”The artist has included a rather unhelpful map on his website, which has the entire 1,200-mile Namib desert circled in red that indicates the location of the installation. Siedentopf seems to have purposely made it hard to find –from fans and authorities alike.“I’m not too worried that someone will put it in jeopardy,” Siedentopf wrote. “Finding it might take some time.”True fans may just have to listen for the voice of Toto to find the installation in the vast desert.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneIrish supermarkets are very vulnerable to changed circumstance. That has rarely been clearer than it was at the end of February last year when the few days of snow which came courtesy of the Beast from the East led to immediate and unprecedented disruption.There were yawning gaps on Irish supermarket shelves as a chronic lack of resilience across the supply chain became impossible to ignore.While the absence of bread was the focus of many people’s concern, dairy products, meat, fruit and vegetables and even many tinned and dried goods appeared to be in short supply during and immediately after the storm.It also became clear that consumers are more reliant than they have ever been on big supermarkets which have taken over almost every element of the food supply chain.And the supermarkets, for their part, are reliant on everything running as it should. They have very limited in-store space for fresh and chilled foods and have fine tuned their delivery systems to such an extent that only what they expect to sell on any given day is ever delivered to the shop.But with a no-deal Brexit looking ever more likely, supply chains could face considerably more disruption than was caused by the snow and that could see many lines of fruit and vegetables, dairy products and products with a longer shelf life that currently come from the UK hit with delays.Prices could climb and shortages could quickly become apparent while currency changes are likely to leave pricing all over the shop.When the then-British prime minister David Cameron announced plans for a referendum in June 2015, 74p bought €1. After the referendum result was announced a year later, a euro cost 81p. Today the rate stands at 89p to the euro and there is speculation that in the aftermath of the hardest Brexit, sterling will reach parity with the euro.While that, technically, would make products made in the UK cheaper for people in the Republic – and it will certainly make products bought directly from there cheaper – the more far-reaching consequences of no deal will see trade disrupted and the cost of many products climbing significantly.All told, more than €4 billion worth of British food and drink is consumed in the Republic each year and this country is the UK’s main export market for groceries. In a no-deal scenario, prices are going to climb and products that are commonly found on our shelves could disappear entirely, at least for a spell.Economists John FitzGerald and Edgar Morgenroth wrote a paper for the Institute of International and European Affairs last year which said that two thirds of the products on our supermarket shelves are made in the UK or come through there, and that a no-deal Brexit would likely to lead to delays on many of those products reaching Irish shops.And according to a separate report published by the Economic and Social Research Institute a no-deal Brexit could cost each Irish household an average of €1,400 a year as prices rise. That is about €3,000 before tax.The ESRI used a database of more than 4,500 products routinely imported from Britain and found that the price of bread and cereals in the Republic could rise by up to 30 per cent in a hard-Brexit scenario, while milk, cheese and egg prices could increase 46 per cent. A range of products – including meat, sugar, confectionery, coffee, tea and mineral water – are also likely to increase by 20-30 per cent.The overall effect of these changes would increase the average cost of living for Irish households by 2-3.1 per cent which, in cash terms. means an annual cost of €892-€1,360 per household.Along with the price hikes there will be shortages, as many products will have to take a torturous route to Ireland or be blocked entirely.Own-brand groceries: Around 40 per cent of a typical Irish shopping trolley is now made up of own-brand products sold by the big five supermarkets – Dunnes Stores, Tesco, SuperValu, Aldi and Lidl. While a growing number of own-brand products are sourced locally, many more are produced by manufacturers in the UK. In the absence of a deal, many are likely to be in short supply, at least in the short term. The supply chains set up by some big players also mean there is a significant reliance on UK-based warehouses for many products which could be problematic.Lyons Tea\u0026nbsp In the Irish tea wars Lyons remains marginally ahead of Barry’s but while the latter is produced in Cork and will be protected from Brexit-Shock, the former is made in the UK and owned by Unilever. In a worst case scenario, the price of the tea beloved by so many Irish people could climb by more than 20 per cent, which would be great news for the Barry’s people but bad news for many others.LucozadeRibena Just two of the more popular soft drinks available in the Republic that are likely to be either in short supply or more expensive in a post -Brexit world, as both product lines are manufactured in a giant processing plant in England’s Forrest of Dean.HB Ice Cream While the old-school treat is still named after the Rathfarnham farm where is was born, it too is owned by Unilever. It closed its Irish manufacturing plant almost 15 years ago and all the ice cream sold under this brand is, in fact, made in England.Fairy Liquid This is by some measure Ireland’s most popular washing-up liquid but as it is made in England, if the worst fears are realised, it could be in shorter supply in the year ahead.McVitie’s It is not just the chocolate digestives that will come under the Brexit cosh but all the biscuits in the range including Hob Nobs, Jaffa Cakes and Penguin bars.Fever Tree Tonic The flow of fastest growing tonic water in Ireland is likely to hit some class of dam as it is an English product and supply will either dry up or prices will jump by around 25 per cent.It is not just the availability of brands that could be problematic though.While air traffic between Britain and the European Union will not be grounded immediately after a no-deal Brexit, the arrangement that will keep them in the air is short term and will expire within 12 months, after which either a longer-term deal will take its place or UK and EU-licensed airlines will lose the automatic right to operate air services between one jurisdiction and the other.A hard Brexit will mean higher costs on goods bought online from Asos, Amazon or any other retailers based in the UK. Any item that costs more than €22 and comes from outside the EU is now liable to VAT, and any item over €150 is also liable to customs, chargeable on some products, notably clothing.Caps on roaming across the EU means Irish people now pay the same when calling, texting or downloading data in the UK as they do at home. With a hard Brexit, making calls, sending texts or mindlessly scanning your influencer-of-choice’s instagram feed while doing your cross-Border shopping in Newry could end up costing a fortune.If a hard Brexit happens, Britain may well leave the single European payments area (Sepa). That has made electronic transfers across all Sepa states cheaper and faster and gave consumers greater control over their finances than ever before.Almost 90 per cent of our total energy requirements are imported, with most of it coming through the UK. It is a business worth about €4.6 billion each year, and difficulties in that space will almost certainly lead to higher energy costs which could see Irish consumers paying hundreds of euro more each year to heat and light their homes. Product prices across the board would almost certainly climb too as the energy cost base for Irish manufacturers would rise.As many as 60 per cent of medicines and pharmaceutical products sold in Ireland are made in, or travel through, the UK, and in a post-Brexit world, the UK will leave the EU pharmaceutical regulation regime. That means new regulatory arrangements will be needed for UK goods sold here. That is likely to be problematic, although the Government does not expect general medicine shortages in the short term. The HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority have been drafting contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit and measures should be in place in time to facilitate the fast-tracking of drugs into the country.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Leah FarrellRollingNews.ieThousands of children living in the State are facing legal limbo as they enter adulthood unless laws governing citizenship are reformed, migrant rights activists have warned. Following a 2004 referendum backed by 79 per cent of those who voted, the automatic right to citizenship for children born in the State was removed, unless one of the parents was, or was entitled to be, an Irish citizen. Speaking at the launch of a Bill put forward by Solidarity that would restore such rights, the Irish Migrant Rights Centre said a generation was coming of age without rights to education or work.“It’s deeply uncertain. At the moment, there is no pathway, there is no queue, there is no line that they can join to secure residency,” said Maireád McDevitt, a youth worker with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland (MRCI). Silibaziso Ndlovu is a Zimbabwean national living in direct provision who arrived in the State seeking asylum three years ago. Her two-year-old son was born in Ireland. “In the long run, it’s his future in this country,” she said. “If we get to the point where we are going back home, how is he going to adjust with the situation in Zimbabwe right now? How is he going to be included in the society?” she asked.No official figures exist for the numbers of children affected, but the MRCI estimates that between two and five thousand children are currently “undocumented”, meaning they are without a visa, as are their parents. Just over 16,000 children of non-EU nationality up to age 14 were resident here for the CSO census in 2016, though not all of them would have been born here.The Solidarity Bill, if passed, would restore automatic citizenship rights to all children born in the State. The party also intends to introduce an amendment to the Bill at committee stage granting citizenship to children resident in the State, but not born in Ireland. The private members’ Bill will be debated in the Dáil on Thursday and voted on a week later. However, Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan has already said that FF will not support it.Speaking to The , former tánaiste and minister for justice Michael McDowell said that returning to the pre-2004 situation would leave Ireland as the only country in western Europe without such a law, and was “not manageable in modern circumstances”.“Especially in the context of Brexit, it would mean any non-national in the UK who had a child in Northern Ireland would become an Irish citizen and get a European passport,” he said.Mr McDowell, who is seen as the architect of the 2004 referendum, said he was confident that if the vote were rerun today, it would pass by a margin similar to the 79 per cent majority who voted for it in 2004. However, he said that he would support legislation that would enable children who had been resident in Ireland to apply for citizenship. “The real thing is if you are in Ireland for a considerable period of time there should be some independent right to apply for citizenship,” he said. “There is a middle way in all of this.” “Currently, children are facing the possibility of being made stateless by the only country which they have known their entire lives. This is unacceptable and must be addressed in legislation. However, we do not believe that the wholesale restoration of birthright citizenship is the correct approach.” Fianna Fáil is supporting a Labour Bill that would grant citizenship to children living here for more than three years."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3758996.1547570736!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and the border conundrum a special report","story":"The Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland has been the issue that has bedevilled the Brexit negotiations, one that has overshadowed the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.Against this background and in light of the misunderstandings that surround the issue of the Irish Border, The  has brought together a volume of information, in a project led by Rachel Lavin,\u0026nbspthat traces the lives lost in the Troubles, the Border crossings and the stories of tragedy and loss linked with many of them.This is part of what will be an expanding collection of material and research from a team of journalists setting out how Brexit will impact upon the lives of people on all parts of the island of Ireland - but particularly on those who live daily in the shadow of the Border.The crisis provoked by the European Union’s insistence that guarantees are needed to ensure that the Border remains “open” in all circumstances has come as a surprise to many of those who voted in the referendum on June 23rd, 2016.Since the Brexit vote, the issue of the Border in the negotiations has strained ties between Dublin and London caused significant damage in the relations between the Irish Government and the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland.Indeed, it has encouraged many, or some nationalists in Northern Ireland, along with some unionists, to think more favourably about the prospect of a United Ireland - even if the Irish Government has continually insisted that it does not want decisions on that matter to be affected in any way by Brexit developments.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc, so unless some special measures are agreed, checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit - one as important to the EU as major crossing-points in Eastern Europe.The 1998 Belfast Agreement - better known internationally as the Good Friday Agreement - laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions.Neither side, to be fair, wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace, with fears that a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remained fully aligned with the European Union’s customs union and part of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries.Northern Ireland would stick, too, to EU rules covering State aids and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules.The European Union’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier initially insisted that this so-called backstop could only apply in Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applied to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected.Under British prime minister Theresa May’s current plan, the backstop would apply to the United Kingdom as a whole. However, the current proposal is still strongly opposed by the DUP and many hard Brexiteers.Everyone involved - Brussels, Dublin, May - has insisted again and again that the backstop is an insurance policy, one that no-one wants to use.Instead, they emphasise that it would only apply if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However these assurances have not dampened down opposition to the withdrawal agreement.Despite what some in the United Kingdom believe now, the warnings about the implications that Brexit could have on the Border were given before UK voters went to the polls in June 2016, not least by the then taoiseach Enda Kenny in London in January 2016 after a meeting in Downing Street with David Cameron.“From our perspective it would create serious difficulties for Northern Ireland and I don’t want to see that happening,” Mr Kenny declared later, speaking to journalists.Immediately, Mr Kenny was criticised by the Democratic Unionist Party and by some in the Conservative party, with DUP MP, Sammy Wilson saying that Mr Kenny had been recruited by Mr Cameron to spread the “scare tactics of the pro-Europe camp in the United Kingdom”.Days before the referendum, Mr Kenny returned again to London. Before doing so, he warned that he could not see any way in which the introduction of border checks could be avoided if the UK voted to leave.“Were that to happen, obviously it means paperwork, it means administration, it means lost time, it means greater inefficiency, it means greater cost.“It would not be the wish of the Irish Government that there would be a restoration of customs and border controls but that would not be in our capacity not to have it,” he warned.Now one of the key questions is what happens if the withdrawal agreement is not finalised and there is a no-deal Brexit. No side wants to impose border checks. However, WTO trade rules would eventually oblige the UK to check \u0026nbspgoods entering via the Irish Border in the same way as those coming from any other destination. To avoid smuggling and protect the EU single market, the Irish Government would come under pressure to do the same.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyWhy is the Irish Border such a big deal with Brexit? The 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for border checks.It also established north-south rules and institutions that helped solidify the Peace Process. The border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure along the border or the creation of a hard border.So what exactly is a hard border? It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials and border inspectors, and potentially police or military personnel if there are security issues around the border.That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Why would there be a need for border checks? Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.What do the EU and UK want along the Border? Neither party to the Brexit negotiations wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.So have they come up with anything to solve this problem? The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement – the orce deal – that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal.The December 2017 agreement also aims to protect north-south cooperation, support the all-island economy and safeguards the 1998 Belfast Agreement. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text – not just a political declaration – around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.What exactly is the backstop? It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland.It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.How have the backstop talks developed ? Brussels believed a hard border could be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit.This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries,.Northern Ireland would stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules. The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier initially insisted that this backstop can only apply to Northern Ireland.London argued that if the backstop only applies to Northern Ireland, it would effectively create a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. The DUP also objected. They oppose any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.So what finally appeared in the withdrawal agreement on the backstop? The UK government suggested a backstop that would keep the whole of the UK aligned with EU customs union \u0026nbspafter the post-Brexit transition period.\u0026nbsp The tranistion is\u0026nbspa standstill period when current EU economic rules continue to apply over the UK. Under the agreement it is due to\u0026nbspexpire\u0026nbspat the end of 2020 but it could be extended to 2022.\u0026nbspThe backstop would be triggered if the two sides\u0026nbspfail to agree\u0026nbspa new trade deal by that time\u0026nbspthat is far-reaching enough to avoid Irish border checks. Under the backstop, the North would also follow EU regulatory rules set down by the single market for goods. This would be enough to avoid a hard Irish Border, but would still involve some regulatory checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea.But there are still problems?Yes, while the UK government signed off on the withdrawal agreement, Theresa May has faced fierce opposition to it in the House of Commons. Many Conservatives fear that once the backstop is triggered, there will be no way out of it for the UK. The DUP objects to the fact that regulatory checks would be needed on goods crossing from Britain to the North and that the North would have to follow some rules set down in Brussels.\u0026nbspIs there a way around this? It is difficult. The EU has\u0026nbspgiven the UK assurances that it will make every effort to negotiate a new trade deal to make the backstop unnecessary, or – if it is introduced – to ensure that it is in force for as short a time as possible. However, crucially, the EU insists that the withdrawal agreement itself must remain untouched. This says that the backstop remains in place “unless and until” another way is found to avoid a hard Irish Border.\u0026nbsp Many Conservative MPs and the DUP are not satisfied by non-binding assurances, fearing that the legal withdrawal agreement is the key document.\u0026nbspWhat if\u0026nbspthere is no agreement?If there is no backstop, there will be no orce deal and no transition period. In other words, there would be a disorderly Brexit and the UK would crash out of the EU in March 2019. It is anyone’s guess how goods passing over the Irish Border would be treated in such a scenario but the UK’s chaotic departure from the EU could create all sorts of difficulties for cross-border trade and beyond. It is also \u0026nbspopen to the UK to ask for an extension of the Article 50 process – its departure date. The other 27 EU members would all have to agree. So far Theresa May has said she will not do this. She has also set her face against a second referendum vote. Under a recent ECJ ruling, the UK could withdraw its Article 50 notification unilaterally. In other words if it decided to stay, it must be allowed to do so.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Government has agreed to group all Brexit legislation into one omnibus Bill as it outlined its contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. It comes after the Cabinet held detailed discussions on its approach to legislation to mitigate some of the most damaging effects of a no-deal Brexit on the Irish economy. The Government said that by grouping it into one Bill it will help speed up the process of the legislation becoming enacted.The Bill, comprising 17 parts and known as the proposed Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill, is to focus on the broad themes of protecting Irish citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs. Speaking after the Cabinet meeting, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for Brexit Simon Coveney said: “While all eyes are on the House of Commons tonight, it is important the Government’s planning continues for all outcomes, including no deal.“We also agreed an approach to no-deal Brexit legislation. “Finally, I updated the Cabinet on developments with our Common Travel Area, which will continue in all circumstances. “A no-deal Brexit will have a significant impact on Ireland, these measures being taken by the Government are designed to limit the damage. “It remains our view that the only way to secure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.” A statement issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that both the Irish and British governments have committed to maintaining the Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangement between the two countries. “Neither Irish citizens in the UK nor British citizens in Ireland are required to take any action to protect their status and rights associated with the CTA,” it said. “After the UK leaves the EU, both Irish citizens in the UK and British citizens in Ireland will continue to enjoy these rights. “Both governments have committed to undertaking all the work necessary, including through legislative provision, to ensure that the agreed CTA rights and privileges are protected.” During Tuesday’s meeting, Minister for Health Simon Harris outlined preparations for the continuity of health services and supply of medical products in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This work involves the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and other agencies.There are approximately 4,000 medicines marketed in Ireland, of which 60-70 per cent come through the UK. The HSE and HPRA have said that the supply of a small number of these products may be vulnerable because of short shelf life, special storage and transportation requirements.The statement added: “The HSE and HPRA are progressing contingency plans, including those involved in the supply of critical medicines, verifying contingency planning to date and, where necessary, identifying clinically appropriate alternatives to these small number of vulnerable products.”  Minister for Transport Shane Ross briefed the Government about potential implications for east-west transport with the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.As part of the contingency plans, the Minister assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and EU ports as a potential alternative for the trade that currently takes place from Irish ports through the UK land bridge.

You’re the Taoiseach for all the country, not just for Dublin city,” he said.Mr Varadkar said he did not give anyone dietary advice or suggest that anyone do anything.“I was specifically asked what I was doing on climate change and I said that I was trying to eat less red meat – not giving it up.”He added: “I had a very nice Hereford steak last night”.He said: “It’s not flippant. It is a fact that red meat increases instance of cancer and also contributes more to climate change.“But I can reassure deputies that I have not become a vegan or anything like that and I’m very happy to eat fish landed in Donegal and poultry and turkeys and pork meat and all of the wonderful products that Irish farmers of all sorts produce.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.3657023.1539082433!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit the","story":"Countdown to Brexit: The UK voted to leave the European Union on June 23rd\u0026nbsp2016 by a majority of 51.9 to 48.1 per cent, with a turnout of just under 72 per cent. This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29th, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible\u0026nbspif all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019.\u0026nbspThe talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or orce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.In November, agreement was also reached on a backstop for the Irish border, a way to provide a guarantee that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK.\u0026nbspThis cleared the way for a draft withdrawal agreement and final talks on a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. This draft needs to be ratified politically by both sides.For a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has\u0026nbspslowly become evident\u0026nbspin the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate.What has been agreed are the draft terms on which the UK leaves, contained\u0026nbspin the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like has also been finalised. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves ‑ \u0026nbspassuming the two sides are still talking.In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves in March 2019 a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. The draft withdrawal agreement also suggests that this transition period could be extended until 2022. If the agreement is ratified and the transition period kicks in, not much will change on March 29th, except for the UK’s formal departure.If there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑ \u0026nbspor even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner. \u0026nbspFor the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market.\u0026nbspThe main threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years. A no-deal Brexit means the economic effect would be more severe and happen more quicklyanuary 15th, 2019:\u0026nbspMrs May\u0027s promised meaningful vote on her Brexit withdrawal agreement takes place in the House of Commons but was expected to be defeated.

Under the withdrawal agreement this is the latest date on which the tranistion period can end.

Moments before the historic vote, Mrs May told MPs: “Parliament gave the people a choice, we set the clock ticking on our departure and tonight we will determine whether we move forward with a Withdrawal Agreement that honours the vote and sets us on course for a better future.“The responsibility of each and every one of us at this moment is profound, for this is a historic decision that will set the future of our country for generations.”But the Labour leader called on MPs to vote down the agreement, saying: “This deal is bad for our economy, a bad deal for our democracy, and a bad deal for this country.” Mr Corbyn could use a point of order in the immediate wake of Tuesday’s vote to trigger a no-confidence debate as early as Wednesday.Mrs May is expected to deliver her immediate response to the historic reverse in a statement to the Commons moments after her anticipated drubbing.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox appeared to indicate that the PM will resist pressure to tear up her plan or to seek cross-party consensus on a new approach.He told MPs that in the event of a Government defeat the Agreement would have to return to the Commons later “in much the same form with much the same content”. Noisy crowds of pro- and anti-Brexit protesters in Parliament Square could be heard inside the Palace of Westminster as MPs prepared to vote at 7pm, in a process expected to culminate in a final result by 8pm.MPs had agreed to vote on a series of four amendments but Labour, the Scottish National Party and Sir Edward Leigh all decided to withdraw them.Representatives are currently voting on an amendment proposed by Tory backbencher John Baron, which would suggest means for the UK to take unilateral powers to end controversial “backstop” arrangements. The amendment was defeated by 600 to 24.By the time Mrs May concluded the debate with a passionate plea to MPs to deliver the Brexit demanded by voters, her hopes of victory appeared vanishingly small.Assurances over the controversial “backstop” received from the EU on Monday appear to have failed to win over significant numbers of the deal’s critics among the Tories and their DUP allies.Confirming that the 10 DUP MPs will not back the PM’s deal, party leader Arlene Foster told a press conference in London: “We said to the Prime Minister she had to get rid of the backstop and get a Withdrawal Agreement that can be lived with. I don’t think she even asked to get rid of the backstop.”In the final day of debate on Mrs May’s deal, Mr Cox acknowledged that the agreement reached with the EU in November was not perfect, but said he was supporting it “for wholly pragmatic reasons”.“It is the necessary means to secure our orderly departure and unlock our future outside the European Union,” he told MPs.\u0026nbsp– PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyBrexit vote latest news: Parliament votes on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - live updates What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important?Will Theresa May\u0026#39s Withdrawal Bill be the biggest ever government defeat in the House of Commons?The Tory MPs who will vote against the Brexit deal: Which way will your MP vote?Brexit latest polling: Public hate Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but still back leavingNo deal vs no Brexit: How Britain could end up staying in the EU after allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

When sideways pressure is applied these tiny needles detach from the plastic backing, remaining under the surface of the skin. Made from biodegradable materials naturally found in human bodies, the needles slowly disintegrate while releasing a hormone, levonorgestrel, which has been used in contraception for decades. “The microneedles feel as if you’ve taken velcro and press it against your skin,” said Mark Prausnitz, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and the corresponding author on the research paper. “Most people don’t find it painful – it doesn’t come with a strong or sharp sensation like an injection would.” Population: Prevalence of any method of contraceptionThe experimental technology was originally developed to provide an injection free way of administering vaccines, with rapidly dissolving needles that release the drug and disappear within minutes. The micro-needles were found to be just as effective as traditional injected vaccines in clinical trials, but were preferred by the vast majority of people involved. Trials to use the technology for diabetes treatment have also been positive. Now research published in Nature Biomedical Engineering journal suggests micro-needle patches can also be used to slowly release contraceptives. In rats, a high level of the contraceptive hormone was sustained for over a month. “There’s a real need around the world to improve access to contraception,” said Prof Prausnitz. “Long acting contraception is appealing as compliance is easier  for instance, you don’t have to remember to take a pill.But self-administered contraception could be of great use where women don’t have any access to healthcare, he added.  A larger contraceptive patch has been developed to use in humans, but not yet tested. As the patch remains in the early stages of development scientists are not yet sure of the cost, though Prof Prausnitz said that he thought it would be similar to existing birth control options.He added that he hoped the team would develop microneedles that last for six months, not one, which would further reduce the cost. But while the team are excited about the potential of the patches, it is likely to be at least five years before they are available for women to use. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Brexit vote latest news: Parliament votes on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - live updates What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important?Will Theresa May\u0026#39s Withdrawal Bill be the biggest ever government defeat in the House of Commons?The Tory MPs who will vote against the Brexit deal: Which way will your MP vote?Brexit latest polling: Public hate Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but still back leavingNo deal vs no Brexit: How Britain could end up staying in the EU after allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

Scientists at the University of Edinburgh were able to identify the 10 per cent of the population who could expect to live five years’ longer than the those scoring in the bottom 10 per cent.Researchers said saliva tests could become available for as little as £150, for those who wanted to know their genetic life chances.The study looked at genetic data from more than half a million people alongside records of their parents’ life.A scoring system was used to analyse the combined effect of genetic variations that influence life.Some 12 areas of the human genome were pinpointed as having a significant impact on life, including five sites that have not been reported before.The DNA sites with the greatest impact on overall life were those that have previously been linked to fatal illnesses, including heart disease and smoking-related conditions.The impact of genes linked to other cancers was not shown by the study.Experts said this could be because susceptibility to death is either a result of rarer genetic differences, or social environmental factors.The research, published in the journal eLife, was funded by the UK Medical Research Council and the AXA Research Fund.Dr Peter Joshi, from the University of Edinburgh’s Usher Institute, said: “If we take 100 people at birth, or later, and use our life score to ide them into ten groups, the top group will live five years longer than the bottom on average.”He said the test could easily be added into those currently offered privately for around £150, at little or no extra cost.Fellow author, Paul Timmers, PhD student, said “We found genes that affect the brain and the heart are responsible for most of the variation in life.”It comes as NHS specialists pilot a new test which tells women their lifetime risk of breast cancer, allowing those in greatest danger to take preventive drugs.The method, being tried by NHS specialists, looks at DNA and family history as well as lifestyle information such as how many children a woman has and how much she drinks.On average, 11.5 per cent of women will develop breast cancer , but the test can identify those with around three times that risk, as well as those least likely to develop the disease.It follows pledges to introduce genetic tests for all children with cancer and adults with some of the most hard to treat diseases in a bid to save half a million lives in a decade.Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, said a gene revolution would transform survival rates from some of Britain’s major killers, as he announced a 10 year plan for the NHS.University of EdinburghBrexit vote latest news: Parliament votes on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - live updates What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important?Will Theresa May\u0026#39s Withdrawal Bill be the biggest ever government defeat in the House of Commons?The Tory MPs who will vote against the Brexit deal: Which way will your MP vote?Brexit latest polling: Public hate Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but still back leavingNo deal vs no Brexit: How Britain could end up staying in the EU after allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

Rachel Zegler, aged just 17, has no professional acting experience but her vocal talents are in no doubt after a video of her singing to an empty school hall went viral on social media.Zegler, a student at a high school in New Jersey and a part-time wedding singer, beat 30,000 other hopefuls to the coveted role.Two years ago she set up her own YouTube channel featuring homemade videos, some recorded in the bathroom, performing cover versions of pop songs and show tunes. On the site she describes herself as “infatuated with theatre, musicals and the people who help them to happen”.In December she posted the Twitter video of her performing Shallow from A Star Is Born, with a caption pointing out that she did not use auto-tune. In the space of a few weeks it has been viewed more than seven million times.Zegler has performed in local theatre productions including West Side Story. After seeing the casting call for Spielberg’s film she sent in videos of herself singing Tonight and I Feel Pretty, and was invited to meet the director.“When I played Maria on stage a few summers ago, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the role again in Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story,” she said.“As a Colombian-American woman growing up in this day and age, strong roles like Maria are so important. To be able to bring that role to life - a role that means so much to the Hiic community - is so humbling.”Spielberg had specified that he wanted the roles of Maria, Anita and Bernardo to go to actors of Latin-American backgrounds - a marked departure from the 1961 film in which Natalie Wood was plastered in brown make-up to play the Puerto Rican Maria.Rita Moreno, a native Puerto Rican, has complained that even she was made to look darker for the role of Anita. “We all had the same colour make-up. It was a very different time. I asid to the make-up man one day, ‘My God! Why do we all have to be the same colour?” she said in a recent interview.Natalie Wood played Maria in the 1961 filmBroadway veterans Ariana DeBose and David Alvarez have been cast as Anita and Bernardo. Ansel Elgort will play Tony in the story of doomed love and gang warfare.Spielberg said: “I’m so glad that we’ve assembled a cast that reflects the astonishing depth of talent in America’s multi-faceted Hiic community. I am in awe of the sheer force of the talent of these young performers, and I believe they’ll bring a new and electrifying energy to a magnificent musical that’s more relevant than ever.”The Oscar-winning director and his team have held meetings with Hiic groups and students at the University of Puerto Rico to ensure that the film is culturally sensitive.Moreno is an executive producer of the remake and will appear in the film as the owner of a corner shop where Tony works - an expanded version of the role played in the original by Ned Glass.The film will be adapted from the original 1957 Broadway musical, using the songs by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Filming begins in the summer.Brexit vote latest news: Parliament votes on Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - live updates What is the Brexit deal, and what will happen if Theresa May loses the vote in Parliament?What is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important?Will Theresa May\u0026#39s Withdrawal Bill be the biggest ever government defeat in the House of Commons?The Tory MPs who will vote against the Brexit deal: Which way will your MP vote?Brexit latest polling: Public hate Theresa May\u0026#39s deal - but still back leavingNo deal vs no Brexit: How Britain could end up staying in the EU after allWho could replace Theresa May as the next Tory leader and Prime Minister?

At last, the endless miles of too-soft carpet, like ploughing through snow but with an extra helping of static, have been rolled up again.As shows go, this was a good one, with plenty of innovation, some stunning products and, of course, the nuttiest gadgets on the planet.The just-revealed products will arrive in stores over the coming months. Here are some of the best devices to look forward to.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis gadget manages to be both mainstream and quirky. It’s a wireless speaker (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) with a delicate, beguiling tone that is highly attractive.But it looks like something Florence Nightingale might carry because it has a glass cylinder growing out of it, with a light at its base.In fact, the glass vibrates and its resonance is what creates the sonorous sound.The light can even be set to flicker like a candle. It is perfect for romantic candlelit dinners, though it’s not cheap: £699.This was far from the only TV launched at CES but many of them seemed highly gimmicky: The LG rollable TV is plenty impressive and the Samsung 219-inch microLED screen called, appropriately enough, The Wall, looked just amazing.But for a TV you can actually buy that won’t break the bank, the GZ2000 was revelatory. The image quality on Panasonic is routinely outstanding, and there were certainly improvements over previous models.But this is a Dolby Atmos TV, and the first with upward-firing speakers hidden behind the screen.In action, these transformed the experience, creating a deeply immersive sound, especially when watching sport. The roar of the crowd was no longer just coming from in front of you.Withings makes spectacularly good health products and its smartwatches appeal because they have analogue hands like, you know, a real watch.This latest model, out in the Spring, will include an ECG monitor, something only the Apple Watch Series 4 has, and only in the US for now. This will be rather cheaper, at £130.An ECG reading occurs when you press on the watch glass (there’s another sensor pressing against your wrist on the watch’s back that completes the circuit).The Withings watch has a secondary dial which shows how close you are to your steps target, too. Oh, and unlike the Apple Watch, this will be compatible with Android phones, too.This was one of the coolest surprises at the show and comes from Sphero, makers of spherical robots and a brilliant Star Wars R2-D2 toy.But the company’s toys have always had a considerable educational angle to them, encouraging youngsters to learn how to code, for instance.Now, with Specdrums, there’s a musical angle, too. Two silicone rings fit to your fingers and when you touch a colour, then notes, loops or beats will sound.The colours can be on the coloured pad that comes with the rings or things in the world around you. Very smart.Back in the seventies, Technics released a turntable designed for DJs. It was incredibly popular and highly praised because it was well-built, very reliable and easy to use.There have been updates since then but this is the first for almost a decade.The new model, in a cool matte-black finish, includes features such as the capability to spin the disc in the opposite direction and neat features such as a long-life white LED positioned to make it easier to see the stylus tip when you’re trying to place it in dim, or no, light. It goes on sale in around May for £900.CES 2019: Chinese firms and US government among conference no showsA smartphone with a flexible screen that folds out to become a tablet, this was a hot gadget in Vegas.But it will need to move quickly to work – Samsung has said its own folder will be out in the coming months.There are certain issues with folding phones, such as the aspect ratio. A regular display looks almost square when unfolded or, for it to look like a regular tablet, it requires a wider-than-usual display when in phone mode. But it’s a sign of the future.This comes from the company that made the Nuraphone, a pair of headphones that go over the ear and also have a bit that juts into your lugholes to deliver strong sound.The NuraLoop is an in-ear headphone which, like the Nuraphone, measures your hearing and uses signal processing to adjust the output to suit your ears, personally.There’s noise-cancelling on board and a social mode that lets the sound of the outside world out as much or as little as you’d like.A pet feeder is straightforward enough, but what if it had facial recognition?

Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said a narrow loss for May could be positive for the pound, as it would give the PM a window to attempt to push through a revised deal. However, he added: “A loss by a wide margin will make it tricky for Sterling traders as the bill will be rejected due to different ambitions. Conservative MPs want concessions that are hard to get from Brussels, meanwhile, hardcore remainers want to reject the deal in the hope that they get a second referendum. “This may lead to two extreme outcomes: either a hard Brexit or no Brexit at all.

It currently charges 1p for every £7.Ms Reeves added: “It is unacceptable for financial institutions to try to game the system at the expense of customers, particularly those struggling with their finances.\u0026nbsp“We need further action from banks and the regulators on the exorbitant fees charged on overdrafts.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB.

He did so and\u0026nbspthe first was duly printed in March 1916.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSegar subsequently worked for Hearst’s Chicago Evening American, creating new characters and sketching baseball’s 1919 World Series for the sports pages, the same year gambler Arnold Rothstein is thought to have conspired with White Sox players to fix the championship’s outcome.How Tintin satirised the Soviet UnionRelocating to New York, Segar began drawing Thimble Theatre and introduced a heroine, Olive Oyl, initially pairing her with the superbly named slacker boyfriend Harold Hamgravy, a get-rich-quick artist.Popeye first appeared at the end of the Roaring Twenties when Olive’s brother, Castor Oyl, chartered a ride out to Dice Island where he hoped to try his luck in the offshore casinos, only to\u0026nbspfall foul of local mobsters. The mugging mariner with the corncob pipe proved a hit with readers and Hamgravy was soon ousted from Olive’s affections.Originally the source of Popeye’s superhuman strength was not canned spinach, operating on him like a fast-acting steroid,\u0026nbspbut the magic Whiffle Hen, whose feathers the sailor would rub for luck. The preference for greens, rich in iron, only took over in June 1931.Other long-running characters were introduced during the Depression years, including Swee’Pea the foundling, Alice the Goon and J Wellington Wimpy, a dozy Micawber figure with a penchant for hamburgers, hence the old-fashioned fast food franchise that still bears his name to this day.\u0026nbspBluto the bully made a one-off appearance in 1932 but only really took off a year later when the Fleischer Brothers began animating the strip for Paramount, bringing Popeye to a wider audience and firmly establishing the spinach dependency. The character’s positive influence on demand for the vegetable was immediate and, by March 1937, the agricultural community of Crystal City, Texas, had erected a statue in Popeye’s honour.Segar died of leukaemia and liver disease in October 1938, aged just 43, but the formula was already well established. In the hands of other writers and artists like Doc Winner, Tom Sims, Bela Zaboly, Ralph Stein and Bud Sagendorf, Popeye went from strength to strength. Quite literally.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché.

They welcome Theresa May’s deal, but only because it is better than the “existential” threat that no deal, trading on Word Trade Organisation terms, would involve.This, for example, is what Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said on the eve of the meaningful vote: “As MPs prepare to vote on the government’s Brexit deal, we urge them to remember they hold the future of the British automotive industry – and the hundreds and thousands of jobs it supports – in their hands. Brexit is already causing us damage –\u0026nbspin output, costs and jobs\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspbut this does not compare with the catastrophic consequences of being cut adrift from our biggest trading partner overnight.”“A managed no deal\u0026nbspis a fantasy,” Hawes concluded.To understand the interconnectedness of supply chains, consider that some 1,100 trucks loaded with parts cross the English Channel every single day, to deliver their goods direct to “lineside”, for car giants such as BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Jaguar Land Rover and Vauxhall.Brexit deal failure will lead to ‘national emergency’, warns CBI chiefToday’s factories are run on “just-in-time” principles – so any delay, and certainly delays of days or weeks, would cripple production, ramping up costs and shredding thin profit margins.For example, in its journey from a basic casting to its place revving around inside a new Mini Cooper S, a Mini crankshaft will travel from France to the UK to Germany and then back to the UK, and probably then back to the continent to be seen in a showroom. Stockpiling parts is old-fashioned and prohibitively expensive and unwieldy,\u0026nbspand disruption to production is intolerable. Sooner or later plants will be run down and volumes reduced to cut losses.Second, consider the position of Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port. With Peugeot having last year taken over GM Europe, of which Vauxhall was a part, it must soon choose where to place production of its next mid-sized models – the new Vauxhall Astra, Peugeot 308 and derivatives. With overcapacity, it has a choice to locate production – and secure jobs – in any of range of plants in France, Spain, Germany or the UK.The UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain. A promising growth industry is already doomedWith no certainty about the future of the UK’s relationship with Europe, and a need to concentrate production, Ellesmere Port, which narrowly missed closure before (a German plant went instead in an EU-wide effort to deal with the recession), is obviously threatened. Even Jaguar Land Rover is opening new production facilities in Slovakia. Toyota and Nissan (with its Renault alliance partner) could move new investment to the much bigger market in the EU. \u0026nbspThird, a no-deal exit will mean tariffs on parts and finished vehicles which will substantially add to admin and to costs. The UK exports far more of its production to the EU than the EU does to the UK, although Britain is a large and profitable market for EU-based firms. VW Group, for example, commands more than 20 per cent of British new cars sales\u0026nbspBMWMini is on about 10 per cent and Mercedes-Benz 7 per cent, meaning that about four out of every 10 new cars from German brands alone.For UK exports, adding 10 per cent to a car’s cost as it crosses the Channel would, again, destroy profitability.Last, the UK, particularly through Nissan, has worked hard to build up expertise in electric and autonomous vehicles. This will also disappear with the investment that will no longer be flowing into Britain –\u0026nbspand is already down significantly. Geely of China, which owns the maker of\u0026nbspLondon cabs, shelved a plan to build an electric van plant in the Midlands. Thus, a promising growth industry is already doomed.\u0026nbsp“Project Fear” for cars would proceed at slow speed. No one scraps a car factory overnight. The decline will be gradual, but inexorable. Makers such as Jaguar Land Rover, which\u0026nbsptend to export more to the US and the rest of the world than the EU, might suffer less and Rolls-Royce and Bentley (owned by BMW and VW Group respectively) might for the same reason feel less pressure but all rely on materials arriving from Europe, from engines,\u0026nbspgearboxes and\u0026nbspframes to\u0026nbspbraking systems and switches.Again, it would be relatively easy to transfer operations, even for quintessentially “British” brands. It would probably take five to ten years to relocate the auto industry abroad, much of it to EU bases in eastern Europe.After all, HP sauce, complete with its portrait of the Houses of Parliament, is made in the Netherlands nowadays. \u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

But a wide range of outcomes are possible, and they will determine what happens next.Under an amendment passed by increasingly rebellious MPs last week, May must respond to a defeat within three sitting days –\u0026nbsp by Monday\u0026nbsp21 January. But her Commons statement will not necessarily offer a definitive plan B she could say she is seeking further negotiations with the EU. The debate and vote on her motion would not have to take place on Monday, giving May a small window for further talks.What, then, are the most likely outcomes of Tuesday’s vote, and what would follow?More than 100 Conservative MPs have criticised May’s withdrawal agreement. On paper, if they and the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs, all voted against the deal, it would be defeated by around 200 votes. In practice, that will not happen. Some of the Tory critics have reluctantly decided to back the deal a small number of Labour MPs have pledged support. So has one Liberal Democrat. May’s twin threats of a no-deal exit and “no Brexit” could persuade other critics to back her agreement or abstain.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSo May might benefit from the “expectations game” if the defeat does not look so bad on the night.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

She won by 200 votes to 117Defeat by more than 100 votes on such a flagship policy would normally see the resignation of a prime minister. But these are not normal times, and May would regard it as her duty to plough on. However, a three-figure margin would\u0026nbspbe humiliating, and would encourage MPs to try to seize control of the Brexit process – for example,\u0026nbspby demanding a series of indicative votes on a possible plan B – including a Final Say referendum a Norway plus arrangement inside the single market and a customs union an EU-Canada-style free trade agreement and a “managed no deal”.Supporters of the different options are keen for their plan to be “the last one still standing” after all the others have been rejected, so much will depend on how such indicative votes were held. If there is no majority for any alternative deal, the prospect of a referendum would increase.\u0026nbspAfter a crushing\u0026nbspdefeat, it would be harder for May to claim her deal could be amended and put to a second Commons vote after further EU concessions. The cabinet’s position would be important – although, like backbenchers, ministers are ided between a plan B deal involving a softer Brexit, and those willing to risk a no-deal departure. Ministers might finally call time on May’s deal, and persuade her to stage indicative votes and\u0026nbsp then adopt whichever came out on top.Is May’s Brexit deal heading for the biggest ever Commons defeat?May would probably need her own plan B to avoid having one imposed on her by the cabinet or Commons. After surviving\u0026nbspa confidence vote as Tory leader last month, her Eurosceptic MPs cannot challenge her for another year. The threat to her is now from parliament. So she might try to build a majority with the votes of Labour MPs – perhaps by embracing a permanent customs union, something she has always opposed.May could make a “managed no deal” the government’s central policy to honour her pledge to leave the EU on 29 March. But that would provoke cabinet resignations and MPs would likely find a way to block it.Some ministers expect May to lose by between 70 and 100 votes. She could claim some momentum towards accepting her deal, and go to Brussels to seek improvements. She would probably get one more chance to put a revised deal to the Commons.\u0026nbspThe EU’s role will be critical in this scenario. EU insiders suggest they will be more flexible once parliament has voted on the deal, and might even reopen the withdrawal agreement. But they would first need to know what MPs would accept.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As good as it getsSome ministers believe that limiting the losing margin to under 70 votes would show that May’s deal is still alive. It’s the\u0026nbspbest she can hope for, and the expectations game would work in her favour. She would tell the EU that legally-binding guarantees that the backstop to prevent a hard Irish border is temporary, might secure a Commons majority in a second vote. May would be tempted to repeatedly put her amended deal to MPs until she got over the line.In a series of votes on Tuesday, parliament’s arcane procedures will be very important. Bizarrely, it possible that there is no specific vote on May’s deal, because MPs will first vote on amendments. Hilary Benn, Labour chairman of the Brexit select committee, has tabled one rejecting both a no-deal exit and May’s agreement. If passed, MPs would not vote solely on her deal. Benn is under pressure to withdraw his amendment as, if approved, it could minimise the scale of May’s defeat (as about 50 hardline Brexiteers will not vote against “no deal.”)The other amendment to watch, tabled by Tory MP Andrew Murrison, would end the Irish backstop after a year in December 2021. Ministers are encouraging Tories to back it. Brussels has refused to put a time limit on the backstop passing this amendment would put\u0026nbsp the ball back in the EU’s court.The amendments, and the order in which they are voted on, will be selected by Commons speaker John Bercow, putting him back in the spotlight, after he was accused of anti-Brexit bias last week.In the Commons today, May repeated her determination not to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March. However, she might be forced to rethink once her deal is rejected. Even if she salvaged it in later votes, time would be running out to push through key legislation needed by exit day. MPs are likely to vote for the government to ask the EU to extend the time limit – not least to head off a cliff-edge departure.Although much of what happens next is shrouded in uncertainty, there is one good bet: an extension of Article 50.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, as\u0026nbspJoe Watts\u0026nbspexplains, other prime ministers have fared just as badlyClick to followIndy Politics‘How many votes?’There are few things that everyone agrees on in the Brexit debate, but one of them is that Theresa May is heading for a historic defeat on Tuesday.Knowing the exact number of votes that she will lose by when MPs make their decision soon after 7pm on 15\u0026nbspJanuary is difficult, with some last minute mind-changing likely.But for some time now estimates have been that around 100 from her own benches could ally with the opposition parties and move\u0026nbspagainst her. Even friendly MPs say it would be a victory for Ms May\u0026nbspif the numbers of Tories opposing her is\u0026nbspin double digits.EU ‘reassures’ Theresa May on Brexit deal but says it can’t be changedTo understand just how bad a defeat that\u0026nbspwould be, it helps to take a look back at some of the bigger losses in parliamentary history.The largest and most controversial ision in recent times was that over the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when 139 Labour MPs stood against Tony Blair’s plans to start a new war in the Middle East.It was the biggest parliamentary rebellion in any party since the repeal of the corn laws in the 1840s, when Sir Robert Peel sought to scrap tariffs on imported corn that led to steep increases in food prices for the British public.Despite the huge opposition to the war in Iraq on Labour benches, Mr Blair won parliament’s backing because of the support of the opposition, led by Conservative Iain Duncan Smith.Ms May will not be so lucky, with Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn steadfastly opposed to her Brexit deal. This means the rebellion on her own side will (probably)\u0026nbspnot only be bigger in scale, but more politically significant because it will inflict an embarrassing defeat on the government.The largest Conservative rebellion of modern times was in 1997 during the final months of\u0026nbspJohn Major’s administration.Could I have done more to stop Brexit?It saw 95 Tory MPs defy the whip to vote against the then prime minister’s plans to pass tighter gun control laws in the wake of the Dunblane massacre.A similar sized rebellion, of 91 MPs in total, was suffered by David Cameron when he tried to pass legislation relating to Lords reform in 2012, during his party’s coalition with the Liberal Democrats.The new proposals were\u0026nbspbrought forward by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, but were scuppered by Tory backbenchers in a tit-for-tat parliamentary battle, which also saw the smaller coalition party block a Conservative plan to reshape constituencies.A rebellion of around 90 MPs for Ms May would be seen as a win of\u0026nbspsorts, demonstrating the distorted political times we live in. It could well buy her enough time to go back to Brussels and try to\u0026nbspsecure a further concession.It was also Mr Cameron who suffered the largest rebellion over Europe, when 81 of his MPs rebelled over EU policy in 2011 – a key moment in that prime minister’s eventual decision in 2013 to allow a referendum.The largest defeat Margaret Thatcher faced was when 72 MPs refused to back her changes to Sunday trading laws as she sought to liberalise the UK’s economy. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

But economists say the measures were too limited to have a significant impact.As Mr Maduro’s second term got underway, the leader of the country’s opposition-led Congress, Juan Guaido, said last week he was willing to replace the president\u0026nbspwith the support of the military.Several government officials have said Mr Guaido should be arrested for treason and on Sunday he was briefly detained by intelligence agents.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nonetheless, there were foreign visitors among the gathered crowds.“It is surreal,” said Manuel Matthaus, from Germany, of the ash-covered holy men. I had always heard about them,” he told the Hindu newspaper, describing them as “one of the reasons we wanted to come to the Kumbh”.“I did plan to take the bath,” he added. “But I guess the water now is too freezing for my linking. Maybe later in the evening.”One concern for international visitors will be the environmental conditions at the festival site. A thick haze of toxic dust hung over Prayagraj for the start of festivities, according to the Associated Press, and PM 2.5 levels were measured at more than six times the World Health Organisation’s safe limit.The dust plumes encompassing the camp came from the sandy riverbanks, said city commissioner Ashish Goel, and not from construction, which has been banned for the duration of the seven-week festival.Nonetheless, they highlight the struggle the central government faces in tackling India’s air pollution crisis. Also this week, Mr Modi’s government has unveiled its plan to clean up the country’s air –\u0026nbspbut allocated just 3 billion rupees (£33m) to the cause over the next two years, less than a tenth of the cost of the festival itself.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

They are mostly nocturnal and known to be opportunistic feeders.  On a hill above Trieste, Italy, at the western edge of Slovenia, I heard the golden jackals howl.This was my second night out with Miha Krofel, a conservation biologist at the University of Ljubljana, driving rural roads through farmland and forests.The night before, along with two volunteer researchers — one a photographer who had become something of a jackal specialist — we had visited four locations where Dr\u0026nbspKrofel had heard jackals.Sunset came late, so we didn’t start until around 10pm\u0026nbspand finished close to 2am. At each spot, we played a recording of a jackal pack howling and then waited about five minutes for a response. Played it again. Waited. We did this three or four times at each spot.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAway from human habitation, the night soundscape is as rich as the night sky. We stood quietly, not speaking, and listened to insect songs, nightjars clapping their wings and roe deer barking. The small deer’s rough cough startled me when it came from a nearby thicket.Science news in brief: From vaquitas to piranha-like predatorsAncient village that predates pharaohs discovered in EgyptWhy predator free islands will help save endangered speciesWe heard dogs barking, unidentified rustling in the bushes, and a faint “krek krek” call that Dr\u0026nbspKrofel said came from a corncrake, a bird that is endangered in Slovenia.But no jackals.They were in the area, Dr\u0026nbspKrofel assured me. He and 37 other volunteers — scientists and naturalists, dedicated and informed — have been monitoring the animals throughout Europe. The effort is led by Dr\u0026nbspKrofel and Nathan Ranc, a doctoral student at Harvard and the Edmund Mach Foundation in Italy.Jackals now vastly outnumber Europe’s wolves, totaling at most 117,000 by the latest official estimate. By contrast, a high estimate of Europe’s wolves is about 17,000. Slovenia itself has somewhere between 200 and 400 jackals, Dr. Krofel estimated, and about 75 wolves.This is an unheard-of expansion of a medium-sized predator into a continent that it once inhabited only on the fringes. And it has only started to capture scientific interest in Europe, which is beginning to grapple with what the expansion means ecologically, and what the issues are in terms of conservation and legal status.So far, the jackals have posed some problems for sheep farmers. How the animals will be received by the general public as their numbers rise is an open question.Smaller than North American coyotes, the golden jackal weighs an average 20 pounds. It is native to the Middle East and southern Asia, ranging as far east as Thailand and inhabiting Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.The species arrived at the southern edge of Central and Eastern Europe about 8,000 years ago, fossil evidence suggests, and started to expand slowly in the 19th century. But the current boom really began in the 1950s and has accelerated over the past 20 years.Jackals are one of the least studied canine predators. Like wolves and coyotes, jackals have family-based packs, but the groups tend to be smaller, with four to six animals, while wolf packs may include 15 animals.A monogamous pair of jackals forms the core of a pack the young may stay with the parents, or leave to establish their own packs.Jackals are not as prominent in tales and proverbs as some other animals, although there’s an old quote, variously attributed, that it is better to live like a lion for a day than a jackal for 100 years. Hemingway described “personal columnists” as jackals, which no doubt refers to their scavenging habits.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

The \u0027Yany Kapu\u0027 tugboat was forcibly stopped and captured by special forces of the Russian FederationJackals did have one moment of past glory. The Egyptian god Anubis was sometimes said to have a jackal’s head. That claim to fame has been lost: The North African animal that may have inspired the sculptures of Anubis has been reclassified as the African wolf.Still, jackals have a kind of renown in some circles. The New Jersey Jackals, a minor-league baseball team, play at Yogi Berra Stadium, on the campus of Montclair State University in New Jersey. Jackals are, after all, known to be clever, resilient and opportunistic — all good qualities in baseball.Substantial populations of jackals now live in a number of European countries, including Greece, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Austria, Italy, and above all, Bulgaria, which has the largest population.Jackal wanderers — or advance scouts — have been found in France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Belarus, Estonia, the Netherlands and Denmark.Scientists think jackals began to move north because wolves were targeted for eradication, particularly in the Balkans. That opened a door, since jackals seem to avoid areas well populated by wolves.Climate change doesn’t seem to have been a factor, although it will probably be significant in the future. Jackals don’t live in places where snow is on the ground more than about 100 days a year. As warming continues and snow cover declines, more European territory will open up to them.Their ability to travel is clear. Mr Ranc and Dr\u0026nbspKrofel tracked the movements of one female who covered hundreds of kilometres. She seemed to have found a mate and established a den before she was shot.The jackals’ expansion is a huge natural experiment, similar to but more surprising than the spread of coyotes in North America. Coyotes were well established in the West and Southwest before they started arriving in the Northeast and Southeast, and lately in Mexico.In Senozece, in southwestern Slovenia, Dr\u0026nbspKrofel and I visited a sheep farm on a rocky hillside ringed by forest. About 350 sheep were sprinkled across the rough pasture they moved away in leisurely fashion as we walked up the slope with Dr\u0026nbspKrofel’s two dogs and a hyperactive young cat.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police monitor Brexit protesters outside the houses of parliament in London.

I asked the farmer, Leon Franetic, about the jackals and whether their presence in his region was OK. Dr Krofel didn’t get a chance to translate.“Not OK!” Mr\u0026nbspFranetic said emphatically. He went on at greater length in Slovenian, with Dr\u0026nbspKrofel translating. He had learned to live with some predation, he said: “We’ve gotten used to the wolf,” because one pack roamed nearby.But jackals were one canine predator too many. In the past three years, wolf attacks had gone down, but now jackals were killing the sheep. In 2017, Mr\u0026nbspFranetic said, he lost 20 to 25 sheep.Although jackals did not initially expand into wolf territories, Dr\u0026nbspKrofel suggested that the two species seemed able to coexist. Wolves now live deeper in the abundant forests of Slovenia, while the jackals prowl along the edges, closer to farms and towns.The jackal kills were messier, leaving sheep corpses only partly eaten, Mr Franetic said. As he saw it, the wolves were professionals, the jackals sloppy amateurs.Marjan Tomazic, a hunter and forest service official, told us many farmers felt the same disdain for jackals, but were less inclined to abide wolves than Mr\u0026nbspFranetic. Occasionally, for unknown reasons, a wolf or wolves will go on a spree and kill as many as 50 sheep.Still, “this is the home of the wolf,” said Mr\u0026nbspTomazic, a confessed admirer.The next night, we stopped by the annual meeting of about 30 hunting clubs in the Primorska region, in Divaca, a town near Lipica. (The famed Lipizzaners were named after Lipica, since some of the first breeding occurred here).Two teenage musicians in traditional dress played folk music on accordions. Club members in uniforms with ties and Tyrolean hats applauded and then listened as the head of the club gave a speech emphasizing that hunters took on the responsibility of conservation and criticizing the government for setting the number of animals to be hunted too high.We walked through a school building with walls temporarily decorated with the antlers of animals killed by hunters that year. Some of the hunters said the jackals could be a problem, while others felt they should be tolerated, like wolves and bears. Hunted, but tolerated.One hunter mentioned hearing a pack of jackals nearby, so after the dinner we drove to the location. We stopped in a plateau of fields and apple trees near Trieste, Italy. Dr\u0026nbspKrofel began playing the jackal recording.Jackal howls are a bit like sirens, but softer and a little wobbly. He said that some people say they sound like babies crying, without that kind of urgency. Nor do jackals have the yips of coyotes or the full-throated baying of wolves. They sounded to me a bit demented, but that’s a human and North American reaction.There was no response to the first recorded howls. But immediately after the second, I heard a faint howl, and then another one, closer. Then, for about half a minute, a group of jackals alternated distant wails.Since it is hard to tell inidual howls apart from a distance, Dr\u0026nbspKrofel and his colleagues count jackals this way: “One, two, more than two.”As the calls drifted to an end, he breathed a sigh of relief. “Finally.”These jackals have established a pack and are reproducing. They are living a successful life. And their offspring have every chance of establishing new packs as they move into Western Europe.But what will happen as that expansion continues is hard to predict. Mr\u0026nbspRanc said that if the spread of jackals in Europe shows anything, it reflects “the fundamental uncertainty in ecological systems.”“Who would have guessed that this small canid would be the likely winner of poisoning campaigns of wolves in the Balkans?” he added.But in Western Europe, the reaction to their presence may be different, he said. Perhaps stricter procedures for waste management and disposal of livestock corpses on farms will have an impact on the animals. Hunters of small game may object to the jackals’ arrival.Jackals are just starting to put down roots in Italy, Germany and Austria. What happens when those populations grow should say more about how much of Europe will be open to them.For golden jackals in Europe, Mr\u0026nbspRanc said, “The moment of truth is soon to come.”University of LjubljanaOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supermac’s had wanted to expand to the UK and rest of EU.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMcDonald’s claimed the branding of Supermac’s\u0026nbspwas too similar to its own and would cause confusion among consumers. The Irish company\u0026nbspis named after its founder Pat McDonagh, who is said to have earned the name “Supermac” while playing Gaelic football in his youth.In April 2017 Supermac’s, which has over 100 restaurants across Ireland, submitted a request to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) asking the bloc to cancel the US fast food giant’s\u0026nbsptrademark on “Mc” and “Big Mac”.Domino’s and KFC among fast food giants ‘forcing misery on chickens’Supermac’s accused McDonald’s of “trademark bullying” and registering brand names “which are simply stored away in a war chest to use against future competitors”.Lawyers for McDonald’s had provided printouts of its websites, examples of advertisements and packaging, three signed affidavits from its executives, and a printout of its Wikipedia page as evidence that it sells Big Macs across the EU and deserves a trademark.The EUIPO ruled that “the evidence is insufficient to establish genuine use of the trademark” on Big Macs by McDonald’s across the EU.McDonald\u0027s profits beat expectations thanks to its new Big Mac burgerUS President eats Big Macs, steaks and crisps on silver plates“Even if the\u0026nbspgoods\u0026nbspwere offered for sale, there is no data about how long the products were offered on the given webpage or in other ways, and there is no information of any actual sales taking place or\u0026nbspany\u0026nbsppotential\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsprelevant\u0026nbspconsumers\u0026nbspbeing\u0026nbspengaged, either\u0026nbspthrough\u0026nbspan\u0026nbspoffer, or through a sale.“Finally, as far as the relevant services are considered, there is no single piece of evidence that refers to any of the registered services being offered under the EUTM.”McDonald’s was also ordered by the regulator to pay costs of €1,080\u0026nbsp(£965) for the decision. It has the right to appeal. In the EU, trademarks can be registered both at a national and EU-wide level.Pat McDonagh, the managing director of Supermac’s, said: “The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition. We have been saying for years\u0026nbspthat they have been using trademark bullying.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

But for activists, the battle is not over yet.\u0026nbspTheir wider goal, they say, is demanding proper asylum rights from the city council.\u0026nbspAlvaro, a member of the solidarity movements\u0026nbspwho is writing a PhD thesis on them, said there was a strong socialist spirit of “fighting fascism, real estate speculation and gentrification by tourism”\u0026nbspamongst what he described as “solidarity networks”\u0026nbspacross the city.\u0026nbspHe added that it is thanks to such communities that refugees and asylum seekers are able to find places to live, “otherwise they would be left on the streets”.He said the asylum application process is difficult for many because they do not fit specific requirements and many end up without a roof over their heads.Created with Sketch.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help? Just leave refugees on the street?\u0026nbsp“Every day we are receiving new people here. We are doing this, but it’s exhausting at the same time. And I think the officials are grateful for our work because it means they don’t have to do their job.”She says members of the\u0026nbspcity´s solidarity network met council officials, who agreed to send a mediation team to conduct a vulnerability report, leading a judge to halt the eviction.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cars are seen on fire at the scene where explosions and gunshots were heard at the Dusit hotel compound, in Nairobi, KenyaEmergency workers and people near the wreckage of a Boeing 707 military cargo plane which crashed on the west of the Iranian capital, near Fath airport.

He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was possible to buy its handsets for some time if you looked hard enough, its first official move into the UK came last November with a highly attractive, innovative phone called the Mi 8 Pro.This week, its second flagship phone goes on sale, the Mi Mix 3, and it’s even more eye-catching. It’s a slider phone. No, not like those tiddly Samsung feature phones from the nineties, this phone slides only about 1cm, enough to reveal the camera hidden behind. Which, in turn, means the phone\u0027s front really is all screen –\u0026nbspwell, technically it has a 93.4 per cent screen-to-body ratio. Unlike other full-screen phones, there’s no notch because there’s no need to find room for the camera.I spoke to Xiang Wang, the company’s global senior vice president and head of\u0026nbspinternational business. We met at the Barbican Centre in London and sat in a corner that defined the eccentricity of the building, with sloping floors and corridors that narrow unexpectedly. I began by saying that this was a building that made a strong first impression and asking him how he wanted Xiaomi to be seen as it arrives in the UK.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I think the first impression of the brand should be that this is a cool company, very young, energetic and very cool, he said.\u0026nbspIt’s a very different culture and different product philosophy to others. That’s the most important thing we want to achieve.”There are certainly some differences that stand out from the start.

We were struggling to pick which one because we have so many,” Wang said.The new phone, the Mi Mix 3, was also a contender for being the first UK release. “It is another high-end model with a good camera, strong battery, new stuff inside. In the end, we went for the Mi 8 Pro because of its design with its cool transparent back, in-screen fingerprint sensor and so on. So, I think the UK audience may like it. We are also releasing a scooter, we think we picked the best, coolest products we have for the UK market.”Yes, that’s right, Xiaomi also makes an electric scooter. The range available in the UK includes half a dozen phones, a fitness tracker, a nightlight and a couple of power banks, but in China the products available are much more numerous. The plan is to offer a much wider range here, too, one day.“Through the Xiaomi stores we want to learn what the British consumer wants and needs so we can bring the right products to the UK. Now, we have just brought the hot-selling products from China and elsewhere because it takes time for us to do the testing and certification for the local requirements of each market. We think that in the future when we have a bigger customer base, we will have a better idea of what works for each country.”So, why is Xiaomi building its presence now in the UK? “I think the rationale is this. On 7 November\u0026nbsp2017 we had our first launch event in the western world, in Madrid, Spain. We tested the market and now we are number three in Spain. We work with all channel partners including online and offline carriers, including building our own Xiaomi stores there. The initial success in Spain gave us much more confidence for the western European markets. These are developed markets in which we had never worked before. Last May we launched our pilot service in France and Italy, in Milan and Paris and so the next natural step was the UK.”This may lead to different challenges, it seems. “The UK has a lot of technology innovations, plus art, fashion, and an energised younger generation. I think this could be a good place for us. There are also a lot of challenges in the UK because the normal consumer doesn’t know us. Those who do know us are engineers and the younger generation who have come across us on the internet. Also, in the smartphone world, the UK is still a carrier market, so we have to spend extra effort to make customisations for carriers. That’s another challenge. Overall we’re very confident.”When I met a senior executive at Huawei a year ago, he said it would be easy for the brand to be the world’s number one (it’s already climbed to number two, overtaking Apple in recent months, leaving only Samsung ahead of it). But that wasn’t the most important thing. What would be Wang’s ambition for Xiaomi?“Our ambition is not to become the number one smartphone hardware company – we definitely want to be one of the important and biggest tech companies in the world. But our aim is not just selling hardware, we are much more than a smartphone company. We build more products than that.”One of the standout features of the brand is the competitive price: Both the new Mi Mix 3 and the Mi 8 Pro are priced at £499, half the price of an iPhone XS. How is the company making the phone for that price?“Internally we are making huge efforts to improve operating efficiency. Actually, unlike traditional hardware companies, we do not spend huge sums of money on traditional marketing and billboards. We use social media and other channels to communicate our products. Basically, it’s word of mouth. If someone loves our products, they will tell their friends, family colleagues.”From 2018 the company set a maximum profit level of 5 per cent. If profit exceeds this, Xiaomi has said they will return the excess to consumers. “Yes, we did this already, last year. We gave coupons to our consumers which they can use to buy our products. That’s one way, which we did last year for Chinese consumers.”Xiaomi expects the range to grow in the UK, but Wang points out that there’s already something for every pocket.“Actually, we have the whole portfolio from the entry-level to flagship covered. We will gradually bring more but we understand we need to be focused, Wang said. The UK market is very different from others, there are still a lot of entry-level products but the high-end part of the market is very big. The phone network Three has been asking us to offer better entry-level products and we are doing that.In the mid-range we want to understand it better, we’ll listen to the carriers more.”It sounds like the company will see what works in China first, to get a clue as to what will work here in the UK. But Wang reveals that this may some day lead to products tailor-made for British tastes. “In the long run, once we have built more resources, we can think about products which can be designed specifically for the UK or Europe. But now we basically pick products from our portfolio. We have to do some customisation, for example the frequency requirements are a little different, so we have to add a band to serve European consumers.”This is now the fastest-selling smartphone in India- everSmartphone shake-up amid Samsung wobbles and the rise of XiaomiEvery phone manufacturer faces a challenge. Handsets have just become the same thing – a black oblong with a glass or metal back. How does Xiaomi differentiate?“The Mi Mix 3 is one way to stand out from the crowd. The competition is severe so we are competing on every front, for instance, design and material – the Mi Mix series was the first to use ceramic, as a unibody, the entire phone was built from one piece of ceramic, including the frame. That’s another choice. As for technology, we always partner with the best, for items such as the in-screen fingerprint sensor.”This is in the Mi 8 Pro, but not the new Mi Mix 3 which has a conventional rear-mounted sensor.Finally, how does he view competition?“I think competition is good – if everything is the same and we have efficiency, the cost advantage, from making it in China in large numbers, then we don’t need to make a lot of profit from the hardware. Other companies have a business model where they need to spend a lot of money on marketing. We don\u0027t do that, so our products are high quality but not high price.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Then, on August  his Somerset home was vandalised. Heres his story.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench Tory MP for North East Somerset but is better known for his period drama persona which has been winning him fans.He entered parliament during the  General Election after working as a fund manager in London.During the EU referendum, he was a passionate Brexiteer and made many high-profile media appearances arguing for a vote to leave the EU.To say he was born into a privileged position is an understatement - he is the Eton and Oxford-educated son of the long-serving Times editor William Rees-Mogg.During the  General Election Rees-Mogg attracted ridicule.This is because he brought his faithful nanny along with him as he battled to be elected in the working class and staunchly Labour seat of Central Fe.He had batted away speculation that he would challenge Theresa May for the leadership of the party, insisting he was completely loyal to her.Rees-Mogg said he was more likely to become POPE than PM.On October  he also said changing Conservative leader could cause more problems than it solves and the party should back May.He said the Torys lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be dficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.Despite all this, he was one of the  Conservative MPs who submitted a letter of no confidence, which triggered a leadership challenge on December , and ultimately failed to oust May.There has been speculation that he might try his hand for the role, but previous polls put his likelihood of becoming PM at -.Outside the political arena, Jacob is a family man with six children.His we is journalist Helena de Chair, daughter of the aristocrat Somerset de Chair.He celebrated the birth of his sixth child with a touching picture on Instagram in September .He wrote: Helena and I announce with great joy that we have a baby Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher, a brother for Peter, Mary, Thomas, Anselm and Alfred.In May  it was reported by The Mail on Sunday that he had purchased a new £million house just around the corner from No  Downing Street.The five-storey mansion is just a short walk away from the Parliament and is also close to Tory HQ in the heart of Old Westminster.Rees-Mogg joked he had been priced out of swanky Mayfair and needed a bigger home for his six children.Rees-Mogg named his sixth child Sixtus, which is a Roman name meaning polished.It is also the name of a Pope and Saint.His full name is Sixtus Dominic Bonace Christopher .Sixtus eldest sibling is Peter Theodore Alphege, who was born in .Jacobs only daughter Mary Anne Charlotte Emma came along a year later followed by Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan in  and Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam in .His fth child, Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, was featured in a video as his father tried to teach him how to say Brexit.Alfred was born in February .In September , a thug shouted at the children your daddys a horrible person outside their London home.It happened on August , , when the Rees-Mogg family were on holiday in the US.According to the police, graffiti was sprayed on a building and on a car as well as the garden.They managed to write posh scum on windows of the house.The MPs th Century country home, called Gournay Court, is a listed building.He also owns a £.m house in Westminster.Due to his strict Catholic beliefs, Mogg admitted on ITVs Good Morning Britain that he did not support abortion even in the case of rape and incest.I am completely opposed to abortion, le begins at conception, he said.Abortion is morally indefensible.The MP has also repeatedly voted against sex marriage legislation.He defended everyones right to free speech, and insisted thathe ever became Prime Minister, the law is not going to change.Soon after Rees-Mogg made his remarks it emerged the millionaire MP was making money out of an abortion pill despite his strong stance against it.Somerset Capital Management, the investment company he co-founded, owns nearly £million of shares in Indonesian firm Kalbe Farma.Reacting to the story, Rees-Mogg told The Mirror: This is not something I would wish to invest in personally but you have a duty as an investment manager not to impose constraints on investors.He added: This company does not procure the abortion of babies.It’s not my money in these investments and I profit from the total amount of client money we hold, not the investments we make.The Made in Cha star and  Im A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here winner has admitted she has the hots for Rees-Mogg.In an interview with the Sunday Times, Georgia Toff Toffolo revealed the politicians she admired “the standard - Zac Goldsmith, Jacob Rees-Mogg. I fancy them all, adding: Jacob’s a sex god.”The reality star elaborated: “The human mind can be sexy. He’s so clever, I just love him, adding: “I fancy middle-aged politicians, but I’ve never been with one.”Rees-Mogg has responded to news of the -year-olds crush, saying he was “greatly surprised but nonetheless flattered” by the revelation.“I am glad Miss Toffolo won and hope this is the launchpad for a glittering career,” he added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is going to be very hard”.The biggest Commons defeat on record was by a majority of , against the minority Labour government in .The largest post-war defeat was by , on the Callaghan minority Government in .Meanwhile, Business Secretary Greg Clark became the most senior Tory to publicly break ranks and call on all MPs to make fresh compromises for a softer Brexit deal yesterday.As the PM’s authority continues to collapse, the Cabinet minister appeared to have already dismissed any hope of the PM winning the key vote next Tuesday.Instead, Mr Clark branded no deal “a disaster” and WTO terms “a dire prospect”.And he called on Parliament to “move quickly and act responsibly”.He added: “Parliament needs to recognise we need to put dferences aside. I hope colleagues in the days ahead will recognise our collective responsibility to get a deal”.No refused to slap down Mr Clark, in a sign of the PM’s weakness, but said “disaster” was not a word the PM would use.The DUP, whose  MPs the PM relies on to prop up her minority government, also kept up their hard line.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the remarkable thing about this row is that it will be based on the assumption that Theresa May has already lost this vote — and lost big.No one is pretending that May is going to win on ­Tuesday night. From No  to the Cabinet, everyone admits that it is lost. The optimists think the right amendments can keep the ­margin of defeat down to ­double digits, but that is as far as their expectations go.The row will be about what to do once the Government has lost. One faction in the Cabinet believes that, in the words of one secretary of state, “the only realistic route to go down is to force it into the EU’s hands”.This would involve devising a motion that made clear under what conditions Parliament would back the deal. Then saying to the EU: If you want to avoid No Deal, this is what we need to address.One Cabinet minister who supports this approach says: “They don’t have the agility or the time to construct that for Tuesday. But they should devise it for ten days’ time and bung it over to Europe.”But another group of Cabinet ministers thinks May can only pass a deal with “signicant Labour support” and so she should invite Jeremy ­Corbyn in for talks after defeat on Tuesday.One champion of this approach tells me: “If she does it well, she can make him take some responsibility.” This secretary of state ­concedes, though, that they don’t know whether May will do this or not, saying: “She is like a train on one track. She doesn’t know how to move.” So, what will Mrs May do Well, one of the few, who can claim to know her mind, tells me: “If the votes won’t come from the Tories, they have to come from Labour. What are the conditions for that going to be ”In other words, vote down this deal and Brexit only gets softer. No  is also deeply pessimistic about getting much more out of the EU than it is already doing. So, May is highly unlikely to go down the route of asking Parliament to show the EU what kind of deal it would agree to.At Cabinet this week, May tolerated some discussion of what would happen next. “No customs union, no second ­referendum. That’s the core for her,” reports one of those present. But will May hold the line on a customs union when that is Labour’s biggest single demand May’s deal is flawed. How could it not be, given the ­failure to prepare properly for No Deal, which has so weakened the UK’s negotiating position, and the loss of the Tory ­majority in Parliament which has hobbled Mrs May But the reality is thatthis deal doesn’t pass, Brexit will only be weakened. The Government doesn’t want No Deal and doesn’t think it could get it through this ­Parliament evenit did.That means it will soften the deal to try to get Commons support for it.The danger for Brexiteers is that voting against this deal could make it worse, not better.EVERY Tory MP needs to remember that a Jeremy Corbyn government would do huge damage to the United Kingdom.Privately, a growing number of Tory MPs who are passionately opposed to No Deal are flirting with the idea of bringing down the Government to stop it,necessary. This would make a Corbyn premiership almost inevitable.Now, No Deal would be disruptive and, given how late in the day the Government has left serious contingency planning, that disruption would be damaging to the UK and its reputation.But this pales into insignicance compared to what a Corbyn government would mean. Labour’s plan to make companies with more than  employees hand over ten per cent of their shares to their workers would do huge damage to the UK’s reputation for respecting property rights.It would contribute to massive capital flight from the UK and inflict lasting damage on the UK as a place in which to do business and invest.But the economic damage that a Corbyn government would do wouldn’t be the half of it. Would our closest allies, led by the United States, really carry on sharing the most sensitive intelligence with us with Corbyn in charge I doubt it. Once unwound, the level of security co-operation between Britain and the other members of the Five Eyes security group would be impossible to put back together.Risking Corbyn becoming PM because you are worried about No Deal is like amputating your leg to prevent your toes getting frostbite.So, let’s consider the events of the past week. The governing parties in Italy have sent messages of solidarity to the Yellow Vests in France, a group who want to remove the French President from office.Italy itself may well already be in recession and with industrial output falling sharply in Germany, even the powerhouse of the eurozone might be going that way.This is a reminder that it would be deeply ignorant to blame every bit of bad economic news on Brexit and that the EU’s problems have not gone away.AT a private meeting with Tory MPs on Wednesday night, Sajid Javid again made clear that he’s a very dferent Home Secretary from Theresa May.Talking about the rise in violent crime, Javid said: “Sadly, we’ve seen a drop in stop-and-search”, before talking about how its use was now increasing again.This was a clear attempt to distance himself from the Prime Minister. For who was more responsible than anyone  for the decline in use of stop-and-search, than the then Home Secretary Mrs May Javid’s comments will do little for the already badly strained relations between the Home Office and No .ORDER is close to breaking down completely in the Commons chamber.Tory MPs are so outraged by Speaker John Bercow’s behaviour that there is a real danger of them simply refusing to accept his authority.On Tuesday’s big vote, there will be a series of amendments – some of which will be designed to help the Government, others not.One influential member of the Government warns that “ he’s openly partisan in his amendment selections then I think there’ll be uproar and he could lose the House”.One secretary of state warns that in these circumstances you could have “ MPs stand up and completely disobey him”. If this happened, Bercow would either have to suspend the session or start chucking Tory MPs out of the chamber.Is it really feasible to have the Speaker eject scores of MPs ahead of one of the most important parliamentary votes in decades The flagrancy with which Bercow has changed the rules leaves him vulnerable to Tory MPs deciding that they, too, are going to flout convention and refuse to sit down when he tells them to.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this.

Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There’s no point in me or the Government trying to hide that.There is no unilateral right for either party to terminate this arrangement.”That means the UK could be trapped in a permanent customs union with the EU unless the  remaining states agree to let us leave, critics said.However, the Attorney General insisted the EU had more to losethe backstop came into force.He said: I make no bones about it - I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in this backstop.Im prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that were likely to be entrapped in it permanently.Mr Cox also defended not publishing all , pages of his advice, despite an Opposition move to hold him in contempt of Parliament.He said: The House has at its disposal the means by which to enforce its will.I dont set myself up contrary to the House, I simply say that I cannot compromise the public interest.Brexiteers branded Theresa May’s Brexit deal “a trap” following Mr Coxs admission on the Irish backstop.Eurosceptic Tory MP Desmond Swayne shouted in the Commons: “So it’s a trap.”Another Conservative, Anne Main, dubbed the exit agreement “a sell out”.MPs were also furious the government defied an earlier Commons vote that the full advice should be published.The Tories allies the DUP joined Labour, the SNP and others in calling on the Speaker to launch contempt proceedings.Speaker John Bercow said he thought there was an “arguable case that a contempt has been committed”.Solicitor General Robert Buckland, in effect Mr Coxs deputy, told BBCs Newsnight it was a complete ersion and a concocted parliamentary parlour game that should be stopped.But leading Tory Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg told the programme: I would say publish and avoid being in contempt of the House of Commons, which is a very serious matter.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear. Poor Coleen, she’s got five children not four.How tiresome.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence. And she is not afraid of anyone.OLIVIA Colman is a national treasure.We have all loved her since Peep Show and will raise a glass on the happy day she is named a Dame.But I can’t help worrying that Olivia is just a teeny-weeny bit over-exposed.Colman is everywhere.Picking up a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite. About to be seen on Netflix as Queen Elizabeth in series three and four of The Crown.As Madame Thénardier in the BBC’s adaptation of Les Miserables.Fronting UNICEF charity appeals and popping up in British Airways safety videos. Everywhere.I do hope Olivia wins Best Actress for The Favourite at the Academy Awards. When she has an Oscar, fewer people will be able to afford her.LOOKING just like one of the “gilets jaunes” – yellow vests – who rampage up and down the Champs-Elysees every weekend, Bella Hadid wears a hi-vis sleeveless jacket.Apparently, Bella’s yellow vest cost £. She should protest about that.IT was a relief to hear from Olivia Newton-John that she is not at death’s door as has ly been reported, but is alive, kicking and feeling good.Apparently, the confusion arose when it started getting about that the star of Grease had gone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know. Close your eyes and you could almost be there. And s***.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “On a computer ­keyboard, the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”Gerry: “Up.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote Handel’s Water Music ”Lindsey: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What name links a chocolate bar and a ship on which a mutiny occurred ”Lauren: “Cadbury.”And Ben Shephard: “In which century did the Second World War take place ”Vicky: “st.”An epidemic of head-tilting right-on morons telling us: “It takes a whole village to raise a child.”Loose Woman Gloria Hunnord conjuring up a horric mental image when she told ice-dancing Saira Khan: “I worry about you when the one-hand job comes in.”And Icons presenter Chris Packham boldly comparing himself to Marie Curie and Einstein with the observation: “I’m a bit of an outsider too.”Though, just so we can put their achievements in proper perspective, neither Marie Curie nor ­Einstein ever got their own episode of Celebrity Cash In The Attic.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I believe in fat-shaming.

Labour MPs jeered at an ashen-faced Theresa May as their leader butchered the Prime Ministers plan ahead of a near-certain defeat. He condemned the botched and damaging deal adding: The withdrawal agreement is in short a reckless leap into the dark. And he said: I can confirm this - that Labour will vote against this deal tonight. And Labour will vote against it because its a bad deal for this country. It came as Theresa May urged MPs to think of the heart of our constitution and trust in politicians as they prepared to inflict a historic defeat on her deal. But Mr Corbyn said the recent months were one of the most chaotic and extraordinary parliamentary processes hed ever witnessed.  He said it was the first time in a generation or more failed to move its own business - while the government had been defeated on a Finance Bill, which enacts the Budget, for the first time since the s. He slammed Mrs May for pulling in a panic a vote on the deal last month - since when she has run down the clock in a cynical attempt to strong-arm members into backing her deal. Mocking her frantic last-ditch call to Unites Len McCluskey to guarantee workers rights, he said: The Prime Minister has suddenly discovered the importance of trade unions. He added: The Prime Minister has treated Brexit as a matter for the Conservative party rather than the good of the country. Tory MPs jeered as Mr Corbyn admitted it was not enough to reject the deal - but we also have to be for something.  He said his own plan was for a general election - but did not spell out his policy on Brexit, beyond saying EU negotiations should be reopened. He added: In the coming days it is vital this house has the opportunity to debate and vote on the way forward. To consider all the options available. The overwhelming majority of MPs voted to carry on with Brexit by activating Article , he said. Reopening negotiations should not and cannot be ruled out. Mr Corbyn slammed arrangements for a backstop - a clause that will kick in on  January theres no arrangement to keep the Northern Ireland border open.  The backstop would extend EU customs rules over the UK for an indefinite period, trapping us in Brussels customs rules with no say over them. Mr Corbyn said at the end of the  the UKwould be over a barrel as it faced a choice to either pay more and extend the transition period or lock us into the backstop. He warned: The last two years gives us no confidence that this government can do a deal in under two years. And he said the debate would inevitably sht to negotiations over an extension of the Brexit transition period beyond .  Mr Corbyn was mulling an immediate no confidence vote in the government tonight. But in a blow to the Labour leader, the DUP warned theyre unlikely to back him - leaving it little hope for success. It came as Theresa May was set to make a last desperate plea for her Brexit deal in the House of Commons. She faced the biggest Commons defeat since the Second World War. MPs were set to vote down the Brexit deal by more than  - making it the biggest defeat of a government since the Second World War.

Despite all the talk of a nation ided, furiously riven over what to do about our membership of the EU - she’s actually managed to unite Britain’s most ardent Leavers and Remainers on one thing. They all hate her deal. I’m referring, of course, to the people gathering outside the Houses of Parliament to protest about Brexit - one way or another. In what is rapidly becoming the political equivalent of Henman Hill, hundreds of Remainers are gathering in the cold on Parliament Square across the road, to watch the result of the meaningful vote come in. It’s like a rubbish Eurovision.  Meanwhile, a bit further down the road, more EU flags are waving, but they’re peppered with the odd pro-Brexit banner. I spoke to Leavers and Remainers, backers of a People’s Vote and folk who fancy a hard Brexit on WTO terms. And I couldn’t find a single person who was there to back Theresa May’s deal. Kate, who works in the NHS, and Pete, a retired journalist, have been standing on the corner all day with a sign that says “Hoot for Brexit”. Kate says they they’ve had “hundreds” of cars passing them and honking their horn since they’ve been standing there - including what looked awfully like a ministerial car, which passed while we were chatting. Pete doesn’t like May’s deal because it doesn’t take us out of the single market or EU rules. “I’d be happy with no deal, so we can make our own deals as we go along,” he said. He reckons the problem was that the EU have been playing hardball, and Mrs May hasn’t.   Meanwhile, across the square, Charlie Rone, a -year-old from Charlton is dressed up as Jacob Rees-Mogg, complete with top hat and tails. He’s a regular protester outside Parliament, and alternates between the Mogg costume and a Robocop outfit. He changes daily because press photographers have confided that they wouldn’t snap himhe was in the same costume every day, because they still have the previous day’s photos for sale. And he’s not a fan of the PM’s deal either. He said: “I hope that the deal gets thrown out, because it’s a very, very bad deal because it cedes all our control away to the EU and it puts us into their hands.” As we were talking, a gentleman in a van slowed down at the pedestrian crossing to advise Charlie to take his top hat and “stick it where the sun don’t shine.”   There’s also a fellow walking around the area dressed as a plague doctor, complete with a black hook-nose mask, shouting “THE BELL TOLLS FOR THE DEATH OF BREXIT.” He declined to be interviewed, but gives off the distinct impression he wasn’t a fan of the PM’s withdrawal agreement. The atmosphere in Westminster tonight is noisy, but relatively amicable. People are arguing about Brexit in the street - but they’re doing it quite politely. There’s little evidence of the sinister, borderline fascistic displays of intimidation that has been much discussed in recent weeks, but it hasn’t entirely gone away.   Tucked away in a corner, next to a small band of pro-Brexiteers hammering drums and ringing a bell, I spotted a placard bearing the slogan “CUCK YOUR VOTE”, and telling “CONSPIRATORS” they were “CHEATING BRITAIN FOR BROWNSHIRT POINTS”. Alongside a picture of Theresa May, there’s a small tree with a noose in its branches. But largely it’s a festival atmosphere, where some of the angriest people in the country have come together to agree that the Prime Minister is rubbish.

Not out of a great love for how the EU did business, but when it came to the jobs of the , people I represent as a General Secretary, the pros of staying in outweighed the cons. But as soon as the result was announced, GMB Union accepted the country’s decision and urged the government to really look at why people had voted to ‘take back control’, because it wasn’t just about who makes the laws and where they make them. The idea of ‘taking back control’ was so powerful because in too many places people didn’t feel in control of their lives – insecure work, migrant workers being used to drive down pay and conditions, not being able to get an affordable house near your family or an appointment with your GP. There was so much successive governments could have done but didn’t which led us down this path –politicians were really listening this could have been a chance to act and put things right. That’s why GMB has always been willing to sit down with Ministers, to discuss the needs and wants of working people in order to make Brexit work for everyone.  I got my first phone call from the Prime Minister last week. I will always pick up the phone when our country’s leader calls - no matter the political stripe - but the fact that this call came at the end of the process and not the beginning speaks volumes. My door remains open. GMB will back a dealthe deal works for working people and the communities they live in. Sadly, what’s on the table is designed to meet the needs of internal Tory Party politics.It’s not a good deal for workers. So tomorrow, I expectMP’s to vote against the deal in Parliament, but with  days to go, what comes next is crucial - ‘no deal’ would be a catastrophe. ‘No deal’ doesn’t mean carry on as normal. It means gridlock at our ports. Prices going up. It will affect what’s stocked on our supermarket shelves, what companies can make and sell, what medicines the NHS can prescribe.  Don’t believe the Tory toffs who like to spout off on telly – they’ll be minted whatever happens. If they were as confident as they sound, their ringleader Jacob Rees Mogg MP’s investment firm wouldn’t be moving its business interests to Ireland. Quite literally the opposite of putting his money where his mouth is.It’s like trying to do your Christmas shopping at half past  on Christmas Eve - everyone will get a load of rubbish or you’ll be in bother for getting nothing at all. It’s a no win scenario, which is why we need to stop and take a breath.We must extend Article . That doesn’t mean saying ‘no Brexit’, it means taking time to get it right, and when we have the best deal possible, the public should have the final say on it . If the Government is confident they can get the deal right, they have nothing to fear by putting it to the test.

They will have the opportunity to back Theresa May’s deal or seek to find a better way forward. The Mirror strongly urges them to do the latter. The turbulent Brexit debate has consumed the nation for more than two years. Energy that should have been spent on addressing our neglected public services, tackling regional inequality, ending the housing crisis and improving skills and education has been exhausted on the tortuous process of trying to engineer our EU departure. A nation that used to be at ease with itself has become bitter and distrustful. Rather than seek to celebrate the things we have in common we now turn too quickly to the issues that ide us. Little wonder many people are sick to the back teeth with the whole thing and just want it over.  This paper shares that frustration. But the ability to tackle the issues that matter depends on getting a Brexit resolution that satisfies most of the % who voted Leave and most of the % who backed Remain. And that will require those most British of virtues: compromise and pragmatism. If our politicians are willing to co-operate rather than conspire, reason rather than spread rancour, then there is a way forward that can unite our troubled land and secure our future prosperity. With reservations, the Mirror backed Remain because we feared the economic consequences of Brexit would hit our readers the hardest. The same argument applies today. We cannot endorse a Brexit deal that would mean less money for things such as public services, the welfare state and more housing. And that is why MPs should not be panicked into accepting Mrs May’s plan just because it is the only offer currently on the table. If you are going to live in a house for the next  years you would not snap up the first property to go on the market, especiallyit came with a surveyor’s report warning it could be uninhabitable within months.  That is what the Prime Minister is trying to sell us. Even with the last minute concessions, her deal offers no legally binding protections for workers’ rights and the environment. Hard won benefits – such as paid holidays, protection for agency workers and parental leave – that are so important to Mirror readers could all be put at risk. Mrs May is also gambling the UK’s prosperity on securing a trade deal with the EU that would be negotiated from a position of weakness. We would enter these trade talks having thrown away all our bargaining chips and with the EU able to veto any of our demands. We will have gone from sitting at the top table to living in a Brussels dog basket. The only option worse than Mrs May’s proposal is crashing out without a deal. Consider those who are in favour of a no deal – the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Sir John Redwood – and ask yourselfthey would ever be on your side. They may be rich enough to cope with the economic catastrophe that would ensue but others will be much less fortunate, especiallythey lose their job and find prices rising. If, as expected, Mrs May loses the vote today then it is time for Parliament to take control. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s preferred option is for a general election. While we would love to see Labour back in power, the parliamentary arithmetic suggests that this is unlikely to happen. And evenwe had another election there is a strong possibility it would result in another hung parliament that is no better placed to sort out this Brexit mess.   An alternative solution is to inflict a second referendum on a weary electorate. While this option remains on the table we should think carefully before embarking on a course that could further ide a country whose social fabric is already fraying at the edges. A far better course would be to honour the result of the  referendum in a way that would reflect the % to % result. By joining the European Free Trade Association alongside Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein the UK can fulfil the obligation to leave in a way that causes the least economic damage. We would regain sovereignty over food and fisheries and would be no longer beholden to EU courts. Environmental protections and workers’ rights would be safeguarded. Anda customs arrangement could be agreed it would solve at a stroke the Irish border question. The Mirror is the first to accept that this option is flawed. We would still be in the single market, which means accepting freedom of movement, and we would still have to make a contribution to the EU budget – though substantially less than the amount we pay at the moment. However, as a member of EFTA we would be allowed to impose an emergency brake on immigration should it be shown to be causing social or economic problems. The people who are concerned about the level of migration should remember EU nationals only make up a third of those coming to this country each year, and we already have measures in place to prevent benefit tourism.   We respect those readers who will hold dferent views. We understand those who want a clean Brexit and we sympathise with those who would dearly love to see us remain in the EU. There is, ultimately, no perfect Brexit. It is impossible to find a solution which will satisfy everyone. Whichever course we take will require concessions and cause disappointment. Having found ourselves in such a predicament we should pursue the least damaging outcome. In our view, that means a sovereign UK remaining in the single market while free from EU control. Only then can we move forward and start to address the problems that drove people to vote leave in the first place: the outrage over inequality the lack of opportunity entrenched regional ides the sense of being ignored by an out-of-touch political class and the lack of power to change their lives for the better. We all deserve a better future. We all deserve our voices to be heard. And that is exactly the cause we should all be fighting for.

A deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it looked doomed to be voted down in the House of Commons. So with time rapidly running out, plans are now being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has triggered  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Officials have sent thousands of letters to firms and have , troops held at readiness in the event they are needed. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and likely have stockpiles of food and medicine at the stroke of pm.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business and Brexit. Instead we have looked through the governments documents - primarily the  notices - to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But ministers are telling you to brace for them anyway... NOTE: This guide is accurate as of the time the technical notices were produced in late .  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament, butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn. Of course, this date has now passed - but pet owners are still encouraged to allow at least four months before travelling.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting.British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit , it has emerged. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport today says: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. Every Richard Curtis film has a grumpy character called Bernard because Tory MP Bernard Jenkin stole Curtiss girlfriend at university. For example, in the classic Christmas movie Love Actually, Bernard is Emma Thompson and Alan Rickmans horrid son. For more fun facts and trivia tune in as Christmas on Dave continues tonight at :pm with a QI Christmas Special.  But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.” Early December: Theresa May tours UK and G with two-week campaign to sell her deal directly to the British public.  December: A vote in the House of Commons on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  January : By this point Theresa May mustto Parliament and make a statementshe still has no agreement. MPs then vote on a motion based on the government statement  days later.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit, the government said. The Armed Forces personnel are split between fully-employed service people and reserves, the Defence Secretary said. Gavin Williamson told MPs a request has not formally been received yet, but what we are doing is putting contingency plans in place. And what we will do is have , service personnel held at readiness, including regulars and reserves, in order to support any government department on any contingencies they may need.  A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit . NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Mr Hancock has also claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling. . You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to then-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. And the M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Researchers who polled , UK adults identied work commitments, busy family le and lack of motivation as the reasons we don’t stick with interests for longer. Further to this, a quarter have a tendency to splash out hundreds of pounds on hobbies such as cycling and learning musical instruments only to give them up them soon after. In fact,  per cent have also given a hobby the heave-ho having NEVER used any of the items or accessories they purchased especially for it. The study was commissioned by the British Heart Foundation , which has a series of charity bike rides planned for . It found the study we’ll spend an average of pound. on cycling during our adult years.   A spokesperson for BHF said: “Modern le is incredibly busy and sadly fun things like our hobbies are one of the first things to be dropped when we’re pushed for time. “People took their hobbies up for a reason, whether to de-stress or socialise more, so it’s important we make time to rekindle our passion for our hobbies or try new ones. “Having a goal to work towards, like signing up to one of the British Heart Foundation’s bike rides, is the perfect way to give people the motivation they need to keep up their hobbies. “And they can take part safe in the knowledge they’re helping to raise money for the charity’s le saving research at the same time whilst doing something they enjoy.”   The research also found the average Brit currently has three hobbies on the go. And in total we dedicate a total of  hours a year to our hobbies – that’s more than  days over a -month period. Having some form of escape, to keep their mind sharp and to alleviate boredom are among the most common reasons for taking up a hobby. Further to this, seven in  adults agree it’s ‘really important’ to have hobbies - and one of the most popular ones in the UK is cycling – with four in  Brits owning a bike.   But three quarters don’t ride it anywhere near as much as they would like to. In fact, the BHF research carried out through OnePoll found the typical UK adult hasn’t ridden a bike in almost SEVEN years. A fth revealed they don’t cycle more frequently because they believe they aren’t fit enough - and one in  said they don’t have a reason to cycle or goal to aim towards. Other obstacles to getting out on their bikes include being too busy and not having anyone to cycle with.   A spokesperson for the BHF added: “As the old adage goes, you never forget how to ride a bike. “We’re encouraging all those lapsed cyclists and people who said they’d like to ride more to dust off their bikes and sign up to one of the British Heart Foundation’s bike rides. “By getting involved you’ll be helping to fund lesaving research for the seven million people in the UK living with heart and circulatory diseases. “In ying distances and regions there’s a ride to suit everyone.” To inspire you to take part in one of BHFs bike rides take this quiz to find out how fit you are.

Rob Haggarty was on his second jump of the day when he launched himself off the ,ft Castelletto Della Busazza in the Italian Dolomites. But the experienced daredevil failed to clear a ledge and was sent tumbling in an uncontrollable descent to a ridge below, his inquest heard today. The -year-old was with a group of  fellow daredevils from around the world on the ing holiday. The tragedy in the Monte Civetta range was filmed by a drone camera. Footage of the tragic incident was today played to Winchester Coroners Court, Hants. Mr Haggartys distraught we Joanna left the room as the drone footage of the tragic accident was played. Friends of Mr Haggarty, who had completed  jumps, said the experienced base jumper was very, very conservative and was meticulous and stayed safe. The inquest heard he was killed minutes after singing Happy Birthday to his best friend in the community at the top of the Castelletto Della Busazza as they prepared to jump. Engineer Mr Haggarty was jumping from a clf face called a positive slope. It was reserved for experts as it was slanted rather than a sheer drop.   His devastated friend Dr Angelo Grubisic, who lectures in astronautics, said Mr Haggarty failed to push himself off the clf face hard enough and his toes clipped a ledge  or  metres below. From this point Dr Grubisic said Mr Haggarty was in a very, very bad situation as it propelled his body in a forward rotation, sending him crashing into the mountain. Mr Haggartys parachute was deployed automatically and other jumpers described hearing a thud as he smashed into the mountain several times before coming to a stop on a ledge. A pathologist said today Mr Haggarty, of Andover, Hants, suffered unsurvivable injuries including a fractured skull and haemorrhaging, fractured ribs and a collapsed lung. Footage, taken from the top of the mountain on June  last year, shows Mr Haggarty clip the ledge just a second after leaping and crashing down. Coroner Simon Burge said it would be impossible to say whether the initial collision with a ledge killed him or whether it was the later two collisions - however he said he would not have suffered. Mr Haggarty, originally from Dumfries, Scotland, had jumped from the same spot twice the year before and had completed a jump earlier that morning, Dr Grubisic told the hearing. Dr Grubisic, a lecturer at the University of Southampton, Hants, and expert in wing-suit base jumping said he, Mr Haggarty and others made their way to the top of the clf by helicopter. Dr Grubisic said: Me and Rob had been jumping for three or four years and he was my best friend in the jumping community.   We went out a few days earlier to do some practice jumping. We did one in the morning before the incident, the incident happened on Robs second jump. He had jumped it twice the previous year. He was very calm, it was my birthday and he had just sung happy birthday to me minutes prior to the jump. He was in good health and in a good state of mind. It was definitely an expert jump, it was not for novices as it was a positive slope. You needed a signicant push off the ledge, andyou didnt get one youd hit the rock below. Rob did not give a signicant push to clear the ledge and he ended up clipping his toes or his lower leg and that propelled him forward and he lost aerodynamism and bumped into the clf. The dangerous point was  or  metres down andyou dont clear six metres or so you are going to hit the ledge. A soon as you hit that ledge, youre in a very, very bad situation. Rob always jumped alone and he was always a very, very conservative jumper, always taking great care and staying safe, doing the conservative jumps which makes it all the more surprising he made the mistake. When I jumped my friend Greg told me I needed to push hard, I just wish I told Rob that.   On the ground there was some chatter that there had been an incident, another jumper came down and said Im sorry, its Rob. At that point I was distraught. Through my binoculars I could see him and his canopy, he was lying down on a clf ledge unconscious, there was no sign of movement. The inquest also heard alpine rescuers took a long time to recover his body as a result of the dficult climb to retrieve it. Fellow jumper Andreas Podlipnik, from Salzburg, Austria, said: We are a group of base jumpers and every year we go to dferent places and spend a week together practicing the sport we love.

Pathologist Dr Adnan Al-Badri said Mr Haggartys injuries were unsurvivable. Coroner Mr Burge said Mr Haggarty died doing what he loved as he recorded a verdict of misadventure. He said: If there was ever a tragedy then this is it.   He was not deliberately reckless and had reputation for being very thorough, meticulous and well prepared. He didnt propel himself far enough and struck his leg with a glancing blow. That caused a forward rotation which is an extremely dangerous situation to be in and he was sent in an uncontrollable descent. I hope it brings the family some comfort that ashe was knocked out straight away it would have been within two seconds, he would not have known pain. He died doing what he loved and I suspectasked he would have said he wanted to die doing what he loved - the great shame is just that it was far too soon.

Gladys and Richard Kruger said they were lucky not to be injured or for their home to be burned down as a result of the bizarre accident. The couple from Dornoch, Sutherland, claim the culprit was a large jar candle bought from Home Bargains. Gladys, , and Richard, , bought the candle from the same Tain store where a man recently purchased a flask which he claimed exploded, leaving him with severe burns.   The Krugers pictures of the aftermath, although blurred, show blobs of pink candle wax spattered on the walls. There is also a scorch mark from where the candle was sat. Another picture shows the shattered remains of the jar in which the candle was held. The couples daughter-in-law, Kirsty Bogue, took to Facebook on January  to complain to the discount store saying the incident was absolutely shocking. She wrote: Candle purchased from Home Bargains Tain store that my mother in-law received as a present this is the outcome of it being lit tonight! Absolutely shocking!   Luckily my father in law who was sitting close by didnt get any shards of glass in his face from the explosion of the glass which it was in and thankfully there was no blaze as it was attended to very quickly. Had this been lit throughout the day whilst busy cleaning the house hoovering another room, it could have easily done more damage as it has already burnt the area which it was sitting in. Surely this could have been avoidedyou sold these candles in proper heat resistant glass! Vicky Bain responded: What the hell! Thats shocking! Glad they are all ok.   Lorna Jensen commented: Thats terrible absolutely shocking. Wendy Stewart said: I had one in bathroom, burned through but didnt explode. Louise Lee commented: The same thing happened to mine too.

Can you please send more information on this across to our Customer Services Team and we can look into this for you  Speaking today, Gladys described the ordeal and how things could have gone so much worse. She said: We were just sitting there when out of the blue there was an explosion.   It all happened so quickly and we were very lucky because Richard was sitting quite close to it, the house could have been burnt. It could have sliced his face or lost his eyesight.

The Duchess of Cambridge, , who was visiting King Henry’s Walk Garden in north London, had joined a group of children who were making pizza. As they chatted, Nadirah, eight, asked her: Has the Queen ever eaten pizza  A smiling Kate told her it was a good question, but she didnt know. The mum-of-three replied: I dont know, I dont know. Maybe next time I see her, should I ask    Emboldened by his classmates bravery, little Patrick, eight, said: Heres my ideal question. Can I see your children  A chatty Kate replied: They would love to come and do this with you. They will be very sad that I’ve been out here making pizzas with all of you and they haven’t been here. They are in school. Another child then asked what school the young royals went to which Kate replied: They are in a classroom. Their school is called Thomas’s. George is at a school called Thomas’s. He’s learning about space. Have you all learnt about space  As she worked with them, Kate said: They are some of the best things to make, pizzas at home, aren’t they  It’s such fun. You can choose what to put on them....all the dferent toppings.... Later inside a ‘woodland’ area, Kate visited the beehives and made feeders for birds out of apples studded with sunflowers seeds with the St Jude’s and St Paul’s school children.She asked the children, Have you seen any birds  Has anyone made these before I was hearing earlier that you have been making pizza. And pizza outside. That sounds like the coolest thing ever.  She also sat down to make bird boxes before she left and was presented with one of apple feeders for birds she had made earlier by Edwina, seven, who had put a note of it reading: Kate [with a crown] love from Year  inclooding [sic] the teachers’ as well as jar of home-made honey and book about birds.I love this, thank you very very much, she said.I’ve had such a fun day.Maybe you could draw a picture when you go back to school of all the fun things you have done today.

The claims come as Meghans female bodyguard is said to be leaving her role as chief protection officer after just six months. It could mean the third resignation for a member of staff working for the Duke and Duchess. It has also been claimed some staff display a certain level of anti-Americanism amid a clash of cultures at the royal household, according to a royal aide.   The aide told The Dailycertain staff members below stairs say Harry is punching well above his weight and are giving it five years.They added: When people join the royal household, they ultimately expect to be serving Queen and country, not necessarily an American actress who has starred in a legal drama on the telly. Previously, inside sources have claimed the Meghans demanding ways earned herself the nickname Duchess Dficult. The reported staff troubles also come after weeks of speculation about Meghans frosty relationship with Kate Middleton. The pair are said to have had a row over Princess Charlottes bridesmaid dress in the run up to Meghan and Harrys wedding in May last year.   Sources have also claimed Meghan feels constrained by the heavy security protection - something the world got a glimpse of during a chaotic visit to a marketplace in Fiji last year, where Meghan was whisked away by her bodyguard. The source said: Unlike someone who has grown up in the royal family and has been used to having close protection from an early age, it can be constraining. “Even though she was a famous actress, she could still do what she wanted in the way of getting around freely. “But in her current role she can’t go anywhere without her protection team, and that’s a massive constraining force on an inidual like her.”   It has also been reported Markle’s desire to be seen as “one of the people” offers a number of challenges to her team, according to The Sunday Times. The appointment of her female bodyguard was seen as a profound moment - and another example of Meghans determination to stand up for womens and equal rights. The guard replaced Harry’s long-term head of security, Sergeant Bill Renshaw, who retired last year.

Pam Roberts, , suffers from Superior Semicircular Canal Dehiscencewhich means she can constantly hear her internal organs at work. The rare condition has caused a hole between her brain and her inner ear which means she is forced to listen to the sounds of her body  hours per day. Pam, from Maidstone in Kent, said: The most dficult thing for me is having my voice all the time like a broken kazoo - I cant ever escape it. There are really bad days where I dont answer the phone because I cannot bear to talk and have to listen to it. I have to have background noise on all the time to distract me from the sounds. My older sister loves live music and my mum likes going shopping at the big shopping centres and I used to be able to do those things with them but the noise is just too painful now.  It feels horrible to be letting my friends down all the time - to my friends and family I look normal so a lot of people just dont realise Im suffering. It affects you mentally and makes you so depressed - I am a shell of my former self. Canal dehiscence refers to an opening in the bone that covers part of the inner ear and can affect a persons hearing and balance. Although the true cause is unknown, it is thought the condition can be present from birth but the average age for diagnosis is . Only one per cent of the population suffer from SSCD and Pam has spoken with just  other Brits who have the syndrome, via online forums. Pam was diagnosed in  and her partner Martyn Smith said the family have since been torn apart by her condition.  The -year-old X-ray engineer said: Pam hides herself away and has become a recluse seeking refuge in the house - she has become a very dferent person to the old Pam. Having a social le is now too distressing for her as she cannot stand to even talk. Every day and all day, she hears the insides of her body - her eye balls moving, her footsteps, her own voice too loud inside her head and her breathing. She also feels out of balance and dizzy like the world is spinning. The couple have two children - Bethany, six and Bobbie, two - and Pam had to cope with her condition even during her second pregnancy. Pam said: The children just want to play and they scream when they are naturally excited - as children do - but its so painful for me. Bethanyunderstands now and sometimes she will tell other children dont shout, my mummy doesnt like it.  I hate that she has to restrict herself for me but it also shows her empathy - she is amazing and thats lovely to see. Martyn added: It breaks my heart everyday to see her suffering and our children need their mum back well and happy and they are missing out on having a fully ing mother. Pam does her best but there are times when she rages about the symptoms, and other times when she withdraws completely. The mum-of-two underwent surgery in the UK last year when she was told by doctors they would resolve the problem but it made her symptoms worse. She said: That was devastating - I thought the surgery was going to give me my le back but things got even worse after that. Martyn has since launched a fundraising page in a bid to raise the pound, needed to fly her to the US for further tests and surgery.  Martyn said: Our family is being torn apart by this condition and Pams mental state caused by the debilitating symptoms she experiences   is affecting all of our lives. Some days there are glimpses of the woman I fell in love with a beautul vibrant woman and mother but those days are rare. Sadly, Pam had a failed surgery in the UK which actually made her symptoms much worse. There is no real knowledge of this condition in the UK - few procedures have been performed by a couple of surgeons who are restricted to a single procedure due to cost to the NHS. So Pams only option to get her le back is brain surgery - craniotomy - with an SSCD expert in USA. Please help me get Pam back to the happy fun loving lady she used to be before this horrible condition took over her le and has totally destroyed her. The family made a plea for , which will pay for Pam to undergo all the necessary tests from top SSCD specialist Dr Gianoli in the USA. If they hit their target, they can then begin to plan for the brain surgery she needs. Donations can be made here.

Alfie Lamb was -months-old when his mothers boyfriend Stephen Waterson twice pushed back his passenger seat with force as he sat in a baby seat in the footwell, it was said. It is alleged Alfies mother Adrian Hoare and Waterson both shouted at the boy to stop moaning as he had little room to move. Hoare then slapped the boy before Waterson moved his front passenger seat back twice, it was alleged. Alfie then stopped moaning before starting up again and then made choking noises, it was said. But the jury heard Hoare and Waterson both ignored pleas from passenger Emilie Williams to check on him during the car journey.  Waterson and Hoare are accused of the boys manslaughter while in a Watersons Audi A driven by Marcus Lamb with his partner Miss Williams in the rear seat. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told an Old Bailey jury at peak, the car electric car seat could apply kg of pressure. He said Mr Lamb heard Alfie cry out mummy and make a choking noise when Waterson pushed the seat back. Referring to Mr Lambs statement to police, Mr Atkinson said: He said while they were out Hoare had been shouting at Alfie. He had felt pressured by Waterson to drive the car. He had been aware that Hoare, Williams and their children were in the back, but he thought Alfie was between the women on the back seat. In his witness statement he claried that when Alfie was first passed into the car, he was placed between Hoares legs in the rear footwell behind the front passenger.  During the journey he heard Alfie screaming and crying and both Hoare and Waterson telling him to shut up. He also heard Hoare slap Alfie. He then heard the sound of the front passenger seat moving backwards, and Alfie shouting mummy. A few minutes later, Williams told Waterson to move his seat forward, which he did. Alfie continued to cry and both Waterson and Hoare told him to be quiet.  He only became aware of problem with Alfie after the car stopped at Adams Way. Waterson has pulled Alfie out of the car and Hoare had said to him what have you done  Miss Williams told detectives the four had gone to Sutton to go shopping and on thetrip to Croydon Alfie was moaning because he didnt have much room. After her arrest in connection with the investigation at the end of February last year , Mr Atkinson said: Miss Williams said Alfie was moaning that he didnt have enough room.  And then Alfie stopped moaning and then after a few minutes Stephen moved his chair back again and Alfie started moaning again but Adrian said that we was going to be home soon so itll be fine. He carries on crying for a few minutes and then he became quiet, so Adrian thought he had fallen asleep. But before that I noticed that he was like, it sounded like he was about to bring up sick but he didnt and he swallowed it again. So I told Adrian to check him but she didnt, she said he was fine and he was just coughing.  Mr Atkinson added: She would hear Alfie make a choking noise when the seat was back over him. She mentioned to Waterson and Hoare that Alfie was choking and they dismissed her concerns. The court heard Waterson fled after the boy fell unconscious and sold the car very quickly afterwards. Mr Atkinson said: The case centrally concerns a blue Audi. It belonged to Waterson, who sold it very quickly after this incident. It was recovered and taken to Perivale car pound. Williams, Waterson and Hoare, all spoke about lying to the police when they realised Alfie was unresponsive, the jury heard. And when arrested Miss Williams changed her original story about the taxi and said she had lied out of loyalty to Hoare. Hoare and Waterson, both of Adams Way, Croydon, south London, deny manslaughter. Hoare denies further charges child cruelty for placing Alfie in the footwell and common assault on Williams on February .

In a post on a wedding Facebook group, the unnamed bride, wrote: How over the top is it to buy my blue eyed bridesmaids colour contacts    Im offering to let them select any other colour, even a rich amber brown like mineShe added: I just think blue eyes would clash, since one of the wedding colours is chartreuse. The woman then shared an image of an example bridesmaid dress, in a bold yellow green shade. Thankfully many people in the group agreed that it would be over the top for her to ask her bridesmaids to wear contacts as it could cause irritation.   It can also be really uncomfortableyoure not used to wearing them. One person pointed out that the bride should be less concerned with the colour of the eyes and more concerned with other things, as a bright yellow dress is likely to clash with just about everything  at the wedding. Another didnt hold back their thoughts on the brides post. They wrote: She can f*** off. I dont have blue eyes, but still she can f*** off.

In the s, Tskaltubo, in west-central Georgia, was a thriving spa town famous for its thermal springs. The waters of immortality bubbling up from the ground were believed to possess healing properties for more than a thousand years. As part of a mandatory state-funded programme, citizens were even given vouchers to visit the spas. By the s, Tskaltubo had become an important resort, serving thousands of visitors across nine bathing houses and  hotel-like sanatoriums. One bathing house was even built exclusively for Joseph Stalin. But after the USSR collapsed in the early s, the stream of socialist visitors started to dry up.   Although some of the spas are still al, many of the once grand buildings were left to be reclaimed by time and nature. Urban photographer Roman Robroek took his Sony ARii on a visit to the formerly bustling resort. The -year-old said: The area is unique due to the fact that the baths have constant running water. Therefore, it is constantly being refreshed and never loses its temperature of  to C.  Many of the sanatoriums that were thriving  years ago, are now abandoned, in heavy decay, and crumbling. Romans eerie images show deserted arcades with columns topped by crumbling turquoise arches - that open onto balconies with views of the woods beyond. In one of the sanatoriums vast courtyards, trees and other foliage have almost completely overrun the space, with vines sprouting from the elaborate brickwork.   And wide stone staircases spiral down to the now empty bathing pools, where the ceramic tiles barely cling to the walls. But the buildings are not completely deserted. After the fall of the Soviet Union, a bloody conflict between Georgian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in the Abkhazia region saw thousands of refugees fleeing their homes. Many of them found the disused spas, and made them their home.  Roman said: Before entering any of the buildings with residents, I asked for permission to enter. This was mostly with hand gestures, since there is rare knowledge of the English language. Every resident that I met was most generous and helpful. They showed me where to enter the building, smiling and waving. I have nothing but respect for the attitude these people have, and I sincerely hope that good will come to them soon.  There are believed to be more than , internally displaced peoplesliving in the crumbling and decaying buildings in Tskaltubo. Roman added: The government has promised that all IDPs will receive a new apartment in [nearby] Kutaisi by , but barely anyone believes they will be ready on time. Theyve been working on them for almost four years now, and hardly anyone has been able or allowed to move.

The baby suffered head injuries when she fell into the ceramic toilet bowl at the property in the village of Taman Diawan, near Kampar. The schoolboy covered his face as he arrived at a magistrates court in Kampar, dressed in a blue checked shirt and black trousers.

After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c371ef565f565.77217960-e1547120137573.jpg ","title":"dundee fc slam fans group for lack of clarity on prospect of merging with dundee united","story":"Dundee FC have hit out at a supporters group for not quelling talk of a merger with Dundee United.The Tele revealed last week that talks between the club#s American owners  and Dundee Football Club Supporters Society Ltdto acquire a chunk of their shares in order to bring their holding from .% to over % have been ongoing.Dundee FC Supporters’ Society plan to hear views of ALL fans before taking position on takeover\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-supporters-society-plan-to-hear-views-of-all-fans-before-taking-position-on-takeover embed # secretjZucEnIaB\" data-secret\"jZucEnIaB\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Dundee FC Supporters’ Society plan to hear views of ALL fans before taking position on takeover# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Doing so would remove the veto rights of the DFCSS over a number of issues, including over the new stadium proposal at Camperdown Park but also safeguards over any future sale of the club or potential merger with another club.However, owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms could gain % of the club anyway through a rights issue without the agreement of the DFCSS.In a statement released this afternoon, the club have criticised DFCSS after the fans group apparently #raised questions to the motivation of the club owners#.It said: #It has been brought to the attention of the club that the Supporters Society Consultation document was circulated prior to the Society AGM raised questions to the motivation of the club owners wishing to acquire the ‘A’ shares currently held by the Society.#In January , during a minuted meeting with the Supporters Society, the club owners informed the Society of their plan to acquire a %+ shareholding in the club through a share issue.#The Society were briefed on the reason for this acquisition, which was to provide tax relief for the club owners and their development company, Dark Blue Property Holdings. This tax relief would be beneficial as they moved forward with the new stadium project.#In January , the club owners informed the Supporters Society of their intention to proceed with the acquisition of the %+ shareholding in the club through the share issue, as previously discussed.#The share issue is a y and costly exercise for the club. The sole motivation of the owners is to offset the losses of the club against any gains made by Dark Blue Property Holdings.#The club met with the appropriate solicitors to discuss this matter over the following months in order to move the process forward.#In July  the Supporters Society enquired whether within this process they could move their class rights associated with the ‘A’ shares into a shareholding agreement.#The owners of the club took into consideration this request, as taking on the Society shares would save time and money needed for the share issue process, and therefore began negotiations in good faith to purchase the ‘A’ shares from the Society.#The acquisition of the ‘A’ shares has potential benefits for both sides, and while the negotiation of the finer details has yet to transpire, one such benefit is that the club could operate in a more commercial manner, which would allow for idends to be paid. This could also allow for greater investment into the club.#It is disappointing to see that the Society has chosen not to make it clear that at no time has the merging of the Dundee clubs ever been discussed in any of these meetings, nor has it ever been contemplated by the owners of the club.#The owners of the club will continue to take informed and proactive decisions that are best suited for

kind","story":"COULD this curious looking head-gear be the worldrsquos earliest surviving example of a Glengarry-style bonnet once worn by Highlander clansmen after the act of Proscription banned Highland dress That is the belief of relentless researcher Robert Harbord who is spurring-on staff at Inverness Museum to help solve the mystery.Being Oxford-based and an avid Highland visitor, Mr Harbord is perplexed by the bonnet which nestles inconspicuously behind glass in a cabinet in the museum building.And his task in hand is no mean feat: He wants to track down the inidual who unearthed it more than  years ago ndash or at least speak to one of their surviving relatives.Because he believes the bonnet is unique.He said: ldquoDespite their very best efforts, and their best record-keeping going back to , Inverness Museum does not have any other information on this particular item other than it was found in a peat bog in Fort Augustus pre-s.\"Its origins are a complete mystery.ldquoMy hope is that an article in the Courier might stimulate someone who does know more about its origins to come forward.Research shows bonnets in the lead up to the Battle of Culloden were knitted affairs, large, wide and flat.Insight into the crucial role they once played has been handed down by many historical sources but none so colourfully than the thcentury government roads contractor Edmund Burt who was sent to Inverness from London in the s.Remarking upon the Highlanderrsquos hardened stance to the wet weather in his letters to a friend, Burt, in his book Letters from the North of Scotland said their bonnets were ldquofrequently taken off and wrung like a dish-clout, and then put back on again.Mr Harbord said his research suggests that following the Act of Proscription in  banning Highland dress, clansmen pushed the sides of their bonnets upwards \"and at a stroke created an entirely new shape of bonnet\".And he strongly suspects that the Glengarry-style bonnet in Inverness Museum could be the earliest surviving example.He added: ldquoWhile the word bonnet was not actually mentioned in the Act, it can well be imagined that a clansman from Glen Garry, travelling to the strategically sited Fort Augustus six miles away, might think thathe was spotted by an Army patrol wearing a Highlanderrsquos traditional flat blue bonnet, he could very well be arrested, and jailed for six months, on the spot.Museum curator xxx apologies her name is in the caption of the pictures xxx said no information exists to argue otherwise.She said: ldquoWe think that it came to us before . Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible. If it does turn out to be the oldest one then that would make it a very signicant object. We would be delightedthat could be confirmed in some way.Tuesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119131.jpg","title":"Inverness cafe closure purely a commercial decision","story":"A CAFE occupying one of the most prominent sites in the city for the past five years is to close, but the owner has refused to blame steep rates for the decision to sell.The -plus staff of So Coco at  High Street were given redundancy notices last weekend, and it is likely the popular restaurant, famed for its Spanish-style chocolate and churros, will close on January .However the owner, the Caledonian Coffee Co Ltd, is actively seeking a new business partner and other premises, and So Coco could rise again after a period of ldquohibernation.Director Roy Dinnes said he was sad to see the business close, especially for the staff who were ldquoa credit to the business, and he was amazed at the social media reaction that saw more than  dismayed customers post comments within  hours.It was purely a commercial decision said the Forres hotelier, and a deal with the new owner of the premises is at an advanced stage. Mr Dinnes gave no details of the new owner, but it is understood to be a company that already has premises in the city centre.Mr Dinnesrsquo company is retaining Inverness City Suites, the six luxury self-catering flats above So Coco, with two more at Hedgefield.Mr Dinnes said: ldquoPeople have been commenting about the rates, but that was not behind the decision to sell. It was a commercial decision, although being on the High Street the business was not as profitable as it could be.ldquoWe have been looking for some time for other premises and a new partner. It is a great opportunity for someone with a passion for food and catering to become involved.ldquoIt has been a great business and I put my heart and soul into it.

Joe Lewis is convinced boss Derek McInnes is building an Aberdeen squad that can deliver glory.Which is why the -year-old believes it is vital the Dons emerge from the January transfer window with their three Scotland caps still at Pittodrie.There is already interest in Gary Mackay-Steven and Graeme Shinnie and the Dons are on red alert for another bid for Scott McKenna.When the window shuts at the end of this month, Lewis hopes the Reds have won the battle to retain their international stars.Captain Shinnie and winger Mackay-Steven are both out of contract at the end of the season and have been free to talk to other clubs since the winter window opened on January .Boss McInnes wants to secure both on extended deals, but admits he faces a fight to do that.MLS side New York City, part of the City Group Football franchise that also owns Manchester City, have targeted Mackay-Steven.The American side contacted the Dons while they were at a training camp in Dubai to inform them of their intention to talk to the winger’s representatives.English Championship clubs Brentford and Hull City are also monitoring Shinnie.Aberdeen knocked back bids of £ million from Aston Villa and £.m from Celtic for McKenna in the summer.Aberdeen are braced for potential bids this month – but Lewis hopes any fresh approaches are also rejected.He said: “We want to keep all our good players and Graeme Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven are two of our better players.“It is flattering for them, I am sure, for them to have that interest.“It shows how well they have been playing and how well we are doing as a club that other teams are looking at our players.“We turned down offers for Scott McKenna in the summer and hopefully we can do the same this month for him.“The squad we have here is fantastic and we are trying to build something.“So we want to keep all of our best players.”While Lewis hopes there are no exits from Pittodrie in January, boss McInnes aims to bring in at least two new signings in this window.He has targeted a left-back to replace Max Lowe, who has ed to Championship Derby County following the end of his loan deal.McInnes also aims to secure another addition to bolster his attack.Following a week-long warm weather training camp in Dubai, the Donsto action on Scottish Cup duty against Stenhousemuir on Saturday.Lewis insists the fourth round tie can be the first step to lting the trophy for the first time since .The walls of Pittodrie are adorned with photographs of triumphant cup-winning sides and Lewis wants to add his name to that legendary list.He said: “When you play for Aberdeen the expectation is there to challenge for every trophy you are involved in.“There is no reason why we cannot win that trophy.“You hope for a decent draw, but regardless of who we get, we should be favourites in almost every game we play.“There is that drive within the squad to go and win a trophy and be another team that has lted a cup.“When you walk round Pittodrie you see all those photographs of winning teams.“I want to be part of one of those sides.“Since I have been here that has been an ambition of mine.”Aberdeen will go into the tie as hot favourites against Stenhousemuir, who are rock bottom of League One.But Lewis insists the Dons will treat the part-timers with the utmost respect.He said: “The Scottish Cup tie with Stenhousemuir will be our first game back for a little while but there will be no excuses.“There is no reason why anyone would take their foot off the pedal for that game or take Stenhousemuir for granted.“I am sure they are a team who have good quality.“They will see this as a massive game and a  for them to showcase their skills and to possibly move on from where they are.“We have to make sure we match Stenhousemuir’s commitment and drive to win.“We have to show we are a better team and have better players, but first have to match that hard work and determination.“You have to show that in every game.“If you don’t have that in any game then you run the risk of losing.”Aberdeen arrived back in the Granite City late last night after their week in the United Arab Emirates.However, it was no holiday in the sun as boss McInnes put the Reds through double training sessions.Lewis insists they will be ready for the second half of the campaign, beginning against Stenhousemuir.He said: “That was the third season we had been out in Dubai and the players are tremendously grateful to the club for putting the trip on.“You don’t get it at most clubs.“Not only did we get a trip to Dubai, we also stayed at a fantastic hotel and used training pitches that were second to none.“As much as the training was dficult, it was nice in between sessions to lie on the beach and get a bit of sun as

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13859701.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171103908.jpg","title":"ayr united fans chance sleep","story":"NewsAyr United fans have chance to sleep on Somerset Park in homeless fundraiserThe fundraiser, being staged by Ayr United and homeless charity SeAscape, will be held under the lights at Somerset Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAyr stars Robbie Crawford, Andy Murdoch, Craig Moore and Declan McDaid join Ky Kane of SeAscape \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United fans dream of playing on Somerset Park’s hallowed turf.

The food giant plans to move into the old Homebase shop at the Heathfield Retail Park. Home Bargains could also occupy the large empty unit, according to documents lodged with South Ayrshire Council. Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys. A planning statement said: “The proposal is not speculative. Unit b will be occupied by Food Warehouse.” The plot is too big for only one shop, according to Heathfield Retail Park operators Ediston. The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"sleazy pensioner took pictures schoolgirls","story":"NewsSleazy pensioner took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirtsA court ruled there was ‘a substantial sexual element to his breach of the peace offence, writes Edwin Lawrence.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  JAN NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sleazy retired architect took pictures of schoolgirls in miniskirts.

for mountain biking with over , visitors each year arriving at nearby Glentress.Following on from a community meeting held in , plans have been progressing towards a vision of how Innerleithen can capitalise further on the growing popularity of the sport.An initial business case for the project is one of a number of proposals in the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal proposition that is currently subject to ongoing negotiation with the UK and Scottish governments.And the outline business case for the innovation centre has been progressed by Developing Mountain Biking in Scotland , a partnership project hosted in Scottish Cycling, Edinburgh Napier University , Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Borders Council.Together they have been consulting and working with local businesses, national agencies and international bike brands to develop the proposalsEd Shoote, regional mountain bike co-ordinator with Developing Mountain Biking in Scotland said: \"The Tweed Valley is already home to some of the best mountain bike riding in the UK and every year its reputation grows.\"We believe this proposal promotes the area to become the European capital of mountain biking.\"Following the previous community meeting the message was clear that Innerleithen had fantastic potential to offer a wider range of trails to compliment Glentress ndash from jump trails to fun family-orientated bike park trails.\"Whilst the plans are progressing with a good deal of political support, we need to ensure the local community is on board with the ideas and will support the proposals.The innovation centre will contain facilities that companies have requested, including cutting-edge prototyping equipment.The centre, which will form part of a wider community hub, will include additional space for childcare, indoor activities like a climbing wall, additional cafeacute space for local businesses to grow into and flexible short-term office space.Lead academic from the Mountain Bike Centre of Scotland, Professor Geraint Florida-James added: \"Crucially, the plans not only promote growth in tourism but maximise the impact of the sport for the local community and businesses by creating new jobs and specialist facilities.\"It builds on the success of Edinburgh Napier Universityrsquos Mountain Bike Centre of Scotland project at Glentress, which to date, has engaged with over  businesses.The public consultation will be held on January  at pm in the Innerleithen Memorial Hall.During the evening, Select Contracts, leading consultants in the leisure and adventure industry

consulting on the innovation centre.Select Contracts CEO, Chris Sutton added: ldquoWe were extremely pleased to be appointed as consultants for this downhill bike park project.\"We see Innerleithen as one of the best locations for a bike park in the UK and Europe.\"We are looking forward to sharing our work on this project to-date and getting local community feedback.The feedback from the

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

Have no fear: the Scots accent passes muster. Elizabeth, played by Margot Robbie, is equally breathtaking, though in dferent ways.

The damaging educational consequences for these children, and indeed all teachers and pupils, are real and urgent.Ross Greer, education spokesman for the Scottish Green Party, said the ldquocrisis in ASN provision was now evident.He said: ldquoThe fundamental issue in Scotlandrsquos schools is that ten years of budget cuts have seen thousands of staff, particularly ASN specialists, disappear.ldquoFewer staff are expected to support far more young people with complex needs with considerably less resource than in previous years, a situation which badly lets down some of our most vulnerable children and young people.There was also concern about a continuing decline in the number of vulnerable pupils with a co-ordinated support plan .

Sure, it features hills, glens and, with David Tennant playing protestant reformer John Knox and Martin Compston in the role of Maryrsquos controversial third husband the Earl of Bothwell, some of our finest actors. But with the titular role being filled by Irish actress Saoirse Ronan, is it really credible to suppose the film can have any impact on our futureit canrsquot even provide an authentic reflection of our past  Worse still, has it deprived one of our home-grown actresses the opportunity to portray one of our best-known historical figures The argument for authenticity in casting is one that continues to rage, particularly when star names are seen to be taking roles that could be better filled by lesser-known minority actors. Yet as Bryan Cranston said when defending his decision to play a quadriplegic in comedy drama The Upside, as the job of an actor is by definition to portray someone they are not, it makes sense for casting decisions to take account of who is likely to attract the biggest audience rather than whose le most closely matches that of the character. After Cranston won global acclaim for his portrayal of chemistry teacher turned criminal mastermind Walter White in hit TV show Breaking Bad, it simply made good business sense for The Upside director Neil Burger to cast him in his film. The business-case argument is certainly a sound one and, as the casting of American Andie MacDowell in quintessentially English film Four Weddings and Funeral showed, giving a film the potential to attract a much wider audience can have a knock-on positive effect for film-making more generally.Read more: Mary Queen of Scots film reviewBut of course the arguments to the contrary are sound too. When Cranston was initially cast in The Upside, US disabled-rights group The Ruderman Family Foundation, which had earlier objected to the casting of Alec Baldwin as a visually impaired man in Blind, slammed the move as discriminatory. ldquoCasting a non-disabled actor to play a character with a disability is highly problematic and deprives performers with disabilities the chance to work and gain exposure, its president, Jay Ruderman, was quoted as saying at the time.Such attitudes are leading to change, with Holywood actress Scarlett Johanssen last year pulling out of playing transgender male Dante lsquoTexrsquo Gill after a backlash from trans actors and queer activists. Similarly, the straight actor Darren Criss, who played gay characters Blaine Anderson in Glee and Andrew Cunanan in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, vowed never to take such a part again for fear of becoming ldquoanother straight boy taking a gay manrsquos role.A logical extension of that would be that those from minority groups should also be excluded from playing non-minority roles, but the recent experience of Surrey-based Grange Park Opera shows the danger inherent in that argument. Having committed to staging George Gershwinrsquos Porgy and Bess in the summer, the company has run into casting dficulties because it has been unable to find enough singers for it to meet the legal requirement of having an all-black cast. Though Gershwin wrote the opera in the s as a vehicle for black performers, the implication of Grange Parkrsquos experience is clear: with too few roles explicitly written for people from their background and there still not being enough opportunities for them to fill roles that are not race-specic, black people have made the self-fulfilling decision that the opera world is not for them.These are all issues that Mary Queen of Scots director Josie Rourke, whose background is as artistic director of boundary-pushing London theatre the Donmar Warehouse, is clearly well aware of. Though she has all but ensured the filmrsquos commercial success by casting Hollywood favourite Ronan as Mary alongside Australian stars Margot Robbie and Guy Pearce as Queen Elizabeth I and William Cecil, she is also promoting ersity by casting ethnic-minority actors Gemma Chan, Adrian Derrick-Palmer and Ismael Cruz-Cordova in what would undoubtedly have been white roles.As Ms Rourke herself says, when it comes to acting everyonersquos just pretending anyway, so it really is no big deal that Mary isnrsquot being played by a Scottish actress. Andher telling of Maryrsquos story attracts audiences to Scotland and our economy gets a boost in the process, then so much the better.Read more: Mary Queen of Scots film review"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-our-mps-must-not-act-as-slaves-to-the-eu-referendum","story":"This is a straight clash between direct democracyand representative democracy , and there is no legislation that addresses it.

She has boxed herself in with her \"red lines\" and has wilfully pandered to the Brexit wing of the Tory Party.At present we are faced by a House of Commons that, apart from a strongly-expressed rejection of a No Deal, is hopelessly ided with no clear support for any of the options currently being tossed around. Surely the cherished democratic wishes of the much-troubled British citizens are best served by delaying Article  and holding a second referendum when a better-informed electorate, having now a far clearer idea of the costs and consequences of leaving the EU, can express their preferred choices through the ballot box.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.HAS anyone  noticed the change in Theresa Mayrsquos binary choice over the weekend as she becomes more desperate  No longer is it between ldquoMy deal or no deal, but now is between ldquoMy deal or lose your grip on power ndash the threat to end all threats, that Tories will almost certainly respond to as she wishes. Have Tories ever done otherwise L McGregor,Gartcows Road, Falkirk.I READ with interest Dr Ronnie Gallagherrsquos letterin which he made use of words which we do not often come across, namely xenophile and xenomania. I turned to the dictionary to determine their meaning. A xenophile is one who is especially interested in attracted to foreign peoples, cultures, customs and languages while xenomania is an extreme passion inordinate attachment to foreign things .I may be misunderstanding Dr Gallagher but I assume he is using them, in the overall context of his letter, in a derogatory fashion. I see no problem whatsoever with being a xenophile. On the other hand xenophobia, the prejudice against fear and hatred of strangers or foreigners or of anything that is strange or foreign displayed by some Brexiteers, is a more sinister matter altogether.However, having said that I see no evidence whatsoever in the letterto which Dr Gallagher takes exception, of xenomania.

The first was held without enough detail of the process and the possible consequences on whichever way the vote went. Despite Jeremy Corbyn`s assurances that Labour would be able to negotiate a better deal, on the assumption they were to win, I am fairly sure that the EU has had more than enough of meetings and will stick to its guns on the deal it has given.The options on the referendum would have to be quite clear: ldquoRevoke article  and remain , ldquocrash out with no deal , ldquoaccept the deal on offer or ldquohold a General Election in the faint hope that the parties will stick to their election promises and be able to keep use them. I am certain that the cost of a referendum will be considerably less than the money currently, and in the near future, being spent on playing with lorries, hiring ferries, purchasing fridges and freezers and so on. What a mess.George Dale, Oakwood Drive, Beith.BOTH Labour and SNP keep criticising Theresa Mayrsquos deal which, in reality, is certainly not a good one. But are clear heads thinking of realistic options  All opposition parties are using Brexit for their own narrow political ends. A second referendum is not only democratically questionable, the actual questions will create a storm and the eventual answer is unlikely to be clear cut enough to allow progress. Similarly, a General Election is unlikely to provide a massive majority for anyone. So the real question to be posed is either to abandon Brexit altogether or exit the EU with no deal.

In Scotland it is only one per cent.ldquoWe are also concerned about the disparities that exist between inidual councils on such support which shows a lack of standardisation over who is identied as having ASN and who get a CSP.At a major conference on the issue last year, May Dunsmuir, chamber president of the ASN tribunal system, said it was her suspicion the decline in CSPs was a deliberate move by councils.She said: ldquoIt concerns me considerably that we have this statutory mechanism that is not engaged at the level it ought to be.ldquoI have a suspicion the decline of the CSP in Scotland is largely because it places statutory duties on education authorities to ensure the provisions are met.ldquoIt is a very great pity to see the decline of something that was supposed to be a supportive tool."},{"url":null,"title":"masterton-urges-may-to-ignore-hard-line-brexiteers-and-persuade-labour-mps-to-back-her-deal","story":"The call from the East Renfrewshire MP came as The Herald was told that the Scottish Fishermenrsquos Federation was writing to all Scottish Tory MPs, urging them to support the Prime Ministerrsquos Plan or ldquorisk losing Brexit.Mr Masterton suggested the Prime Minister, faced with Leave-supporting MPs who would not vote for Mrs Mayrsquos proposed compromise, should \"write them off\".Admitting he expects the Government to lose tonights vote on the Brexit deal, Mr Masterton told BBC Scotland: ldquoThis deal is worth supporting.\"Thats not going to carry the day today but my hope is that once some MPs - who have been frankly treating this all as a game - let off some steam tonight by voting against the deal [they] then start to narrow and focus on a way forward.\"Everyone is very good at saying what theyre against and what they dont want but theyre not very good at what they do want and what they will accept.\"The Scottish Tory MP claimed contacts in Brussels had told him there was a feeling of wanting to help the UK but European leaders did not want to waste \"political capital on something that they dont think is going to satisfy the hard-line Brexiteers in the Conservative Party\".ldquoWhat the Prime Minister has to accept is that theres probably a couple of dozen Conservative MPs that will not accept any kind of deal whatsoever, said Mr Masterton.\"So, frankly, she just needs to ignore them and write them off and look at where she can replace those votes from where in Parliament and build a better consensus and go back to Brussels on that basis.\"Responding to former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raabs suggestion the EU was attempting to stop the UK leaving with \"bullying\" and \"intransigent stubbornness\", the Scottish backbencher accused Brexiteers of \"playing a very dangerous game\".He said: \"The only people going to end up jeopardising Brexit and stopping us leaving are people like Dominic Raab.

In effect, this means that the chances are there will be around .pm a straight vote on the May Plan, thus raising the prospect of a sizeable and humiliating defeat for the PM.The amendments to be voted on from pm are:*Labourrsquos, which rejects Mrs Mayrsquos compromise proposal because it fails to provide a permanent customs union and \"strong single market deal\" as set out in its \"six tests\"*the SNPrsquos, which declines to approve the PMrsquos proposed deal and calls for the UKs departure from the EU to be delayed until another withdrawal deal is agreed*Conservative MP John Barons, which would enable the UK to terminate the backstop at any time and without the agreement of the EU.Mr Bercow explained that they would be voted on in this order and that Mr Baronrsquos amendment would be called onlySir Edwardrsquos was rejected.During Commons exchanges, Mr Swire launched a thinly-veiled attack on the Speaker, asking Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General,he believed the ldquonon-selection of his and Mr Murrisonrsquos amendments would make the ldquoGovernmentrsquos challenge harder to convince those of us who are still concerned about the implications of the backstop.Mr Cox replied that he had never underestimated the challenge facing the Government but said that after reflection he had concluded the risk of the backstop was an ldquoacceptable one.Meanwhile, the Democratic Unionists pointed out that what MPs were being asked to vote on this evening was the ldquolegally-binding Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with the EU, which did not contain any end date on the backstop.The party said in a statement: ldquoThe Prime Minister has known for many weeks what we require.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles. I also want to make sure that Michael Ross’s family get the right to reply.”If you have information which could be valuable to Mr Clarkson, you can contact him on  , or by emailing wensleyclarkson@yahoocopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wherever you are in Scotland – all you need is a clear night, a dark place to watch and a dose of good luck!Scottish Natural Heritage are currently running a competition to find the best image of the lights, with budding photographers in with the chance of winning a  Scottish Natural Heritage calendar.Jonathan Swale, who works on Shetland for Scottish Natural Heritage, is a keen watcher of the aurora borealis.“The winter months are the best time of year to see the northern lights and the best time is a couple of hours either side of midnight,# he said.#This amazing spectacle is caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gas particles in the Earth’s atmosphere. This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument. I think it will be an amazing viewpoint for villagers and tourists.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoThe council has offered a community buyout and are waiting to hearthis is a proposal the group want to progress. We are following the findings of the health and safety report that highlighted a number of issues. Our insurance section has also advised us that the council would be unable to insure the monument for this public kind of use.The petition can be viewed at www.change.org p the-highland-council-open-the-hector-macdonald-monument-to-the-publicWhat do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupTuesday  Jan  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Highlands and Islands development manager David Richardson said there are not enough suitably qualied job seekers to fill Highland vacancies and that has been the situation for some time.But things will only get worse unless the UK Government accepts a new immigration policy ldquothat helps rather than hinders the Highlands.He said: ldquoAs their workforces shrink, many employers will find it very hard to provide the levels of service that their customers expect and demand.

When MPs pass judgement on her proposed Brexit deal today – and, surely, the Prime Minister cannot delay the “meaningful vote” again – it will have a profound effect on le in this country.The deal is a flawed, fudged compromise that leaves the UK subject to EU rules without having any say in them and many of the most important questions unanswered. But that is virtually a product of the task May’s Government set itself: to leave the European Union, Single Market and Customs Union, while at the same time safeguarding the UK economy.Those two things – Britain’s EU membership and its economic fortunes – are so closely interwoven that untangling it has proved to be something of a Gordian knot, while the Irish border question is probably harder to answer than Tam Dalyell’s West Lothian one.The situation would have been much easierMay had decided we could leave the EU but stay in the Single Market. Brexiteers’ inevitable rage would have been ameliorated by the UK’s actual departure and they could have continued to campaign for a clean break, while Remainers would have been happy to have avoided one.: No-deal Brexit will fuel Scottish independence calls, Theresa May admitsHowever, the situation now facing MPs is this. Those that wish to see Brexit happen should vote for May’s deal. It may be a terrible one, but it is signicantly better than a no-deal despite empty rhetoric about the opposite being true. For the sake of their own cause, they should be pragmatic.If Brexit Britain is born into a recession of  proportions, which some experts say could be the effect of a no-deal,Leave voters’ hopes for a brighter future are unceremoniously shattered, the consequences could be dire. Tough economic times have a tendency to boost support for the extremes of politics and its supporters will be hunting for people to blame. Things could get decidedly ugly.Evena hard Brexit was in the interests of the UK – and it is not – it is simply common sense to achieve such a dramatic change in stages, rather than overnight.And Brexiteer MPs should also support May from a purely tactical point of view. There appears to be a majority in the Commons against a no-deal exit, soher deal fails Brexit could well be delayed or called off, pending a second referendum.: Brexit: Theresa May accused of ‘hypocrisy’ over devolution votesAs for Remain MPs, voting against May’s deal carries a risk of achieving precisely what they hope to avoid. While it seems like there is a Commons majority to stop it, a no-deal Brexit is the default position. So Remainers planning to vote against May better be certain they have the numbers required to prevent an accidental catastrophe. Historians will not be kindthey get that calculation wrong.Overturning the result of the EU referendum would obviously require another one in which the latest ‘Will of the People’ was expressed – and the people actually voted to Remain. As sensible as it seems to some, that result is far from guaranteed and a second Leave vote would end all debate we’d get what we asked for, whether we liked it or not.In essence, The Scotsman’s view is that avoiding a no-deal Brexit is now the overriding priority. Anything – even May’s terrible deal – but that. It would have been betterwe’d never got into this terrible mess, but here we are, deep in it, and any escape route will involve pragmatism, compromisenecessary, and a firm commitment to peaceful, liberal democracy. Sinister forces are circling – quite literally at Westminster – but politicians of all parties must speak out against any signs of violence or rhetoric that might encourage it.

This was before an April  meeting between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon when the First Minister claims she was first told about the probe into Salmond.: Sturgeon faces second inquiry into botched Salmond probeThis has been denied by Ms Lloyd, with Ms Sturgeon’s spokesman suggesting she had only referred to claims of sexual harassment by the ex-First Minister as a result of media inquiries.And Ms Sturgeon’s spokesman went on the offensive over a series of attacks by the Salmond camp over Ms Lloyd’s involvement.“Your talking about Liz here - Liz is the subject of what quite openly is now being briefed as a vendetta,” he said.The spokesman added: “There is an agenda at play here in terms of Liz’s involvement - that has been made abundantly clear by what has been briefed by the other side.”The accusation of a briefing war have been dismissed by sources close to the former First Minister.Mt Aberdein, who served as Mr Salmond’s chief of staff during his time in office, revealed in a statement last night he met Ms Sturgeon’s aide Liz Lloyd twice in March last year.At the second meeting in late March he said Ms Lloyd confirmed “she suspected the Scottish Government had received an official complaint about Mr Salmond”.Mr Aberdein said: “She made clear she did not know the full details of any potential complaint and had not alerted the First Minister to her suspicions about a potential complaint.”Ms Sturgeon’s spokesman made it clear today that Ms Lloyd did not know an inquiry had been launched, but hinted she was aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against Salmond as a result of media inquiries.He said: “We, including myself in this for obvious reasons, and people who work with you guysreceiving calls on a daily basis from members of the media become aware of things that the media are asking about.

She will close tonight’s debate, making a final appeal before MPs walk through the ision lobbies to decide on as many as  amendments before a final ‘meaningful vote’.Wrecking attempts MPs are set to mount include a bid by the SNP to extend the Article  process and delay Brexit to allow time for a second EU referendum.In her final message ahead of today’s vote, the First Minister said: “People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly against Brexit.“The door to staying in the EU is now clearly open and Westminster MPs must not slam it shut.”Ms Sturgeon claimed “the chances of remaining are at their highest since the EU referendum”.She said: “MPs must therefore come together to vote down this bad deal, rule out no deal, extend the Article  process and call another referendum. This opportunity must be grasped.”Brussels came to the government’s aid in the final  hours before the vote, publishing letters that offered what the Prime Minister insisted were legally enforceable assurances the controversial Irish border ‘backstop’ would not be needed. But they were dismissed by Brexiteers and the government’s one-time DUP allies, who said “there is nothing new ... nothing has changed”.In a further blow, Tory MP Gareth Johnson resigned as a government whip to oppose Mrs May’s deal. “Over these next  hours, give this deal a second look,” Mrs May pleaded with MPs in the Commons yesterday. “No, it is not perfect. And yes, it is a compromise.“But when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this House tomorrow and ask: Did we deliver on the country’s vote to leave the European Union “Did we safeguard our economy, our security and our Union  Or did we let the British people down ”Mrs May’s government has previously insisted that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and dismissed any suggestion that a second independence referendum could take place as a result of Brexit.But she asked her critics: “What would a no-deal Brexit do to strengthen the hand of those campaigning for Scottish independence – or indeed those demanding a border poll in Northern Ireland “Surely this is the real threat to our Union.”The letters between Mrs May and EU chiefs did not set a firm end date for the backstop, which will come into forcea trade deal that prevents a hard border in Ireland isn’t agreed by the end of .The insurance policy for the border would see the whole UK remain under EU customs rules, but would also apply a dferent set of EU regulations and standards in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.In their letters, Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and council president Donald Tusk confirmed the EU did not want the “suboptimal” trade conditions of the backstop to come into force and would seek a free trade agreement “very rapidly”.In a potentially signicant sht, Brussels also confirmed it would consider alternative “facilitative arrangements and technologies” to prevent a hard border that have been suggested by Brexiteers.However, EU chiefs insisted they were “not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement”, which sets out an indefinite backstop that could only be abandoned through joint agreement with Brussels.“I fully understand that these new assurances still will not go as far as some would like,” Mrs May admitted to MPs.“I recognise that some members wanted to see changes to the withdrawal agreement a unilateral exit mechanism from the backstop, an end date or rejecting the backstop altogether … but the simple truth is this. The EU was not prepared to agree to this. And rejecting the backstop altogether means no deal.“Whatever version of the future relationship you might want to see – from Norway to Canada to any number of iations – all of them require a withdrawal agreement and any withdrawal agreement will contain the backstop. And that is not going to change however the House votes.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said MPs would “not be fooled”. He said letters from the EU and the Prime Minister were “nothing more than a repetition of exactly the same position that was pulled more than one month ago”.“I can think of no greater example of democracy in action than for this House to reject a deal that is clearly bad for this country,” he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4856678.1547550909!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots tory mp urges theresa may to write off hard line brexiteers","story":"Theresa May should ignore her party#s #hard-line Brexiteers# and pass a Brexit deal with support from other parties, a Scottish Conservative MP has said.Criticising Leave-supporting MPs who will not vote for Mrs May’s Withdrawal Agreement, Paul Masterton said the Prime Minister should “write them off”.: Brexit puts paid to plan to cut number of police officersAdmitting he expects the Government to lose tonight’s vote on the Brexit deal, the MP for East Renfrewshire told BBC Scotland: “My view is that this deal is worth supporting.“That’s not going to carry the day today but my hope is that once some MPs - who have been frankly treating this all as a game - let off some steam tonight by voting against the dealthen start to narrow and focus on a way forward.“Everyone is very good at saying what they’re against and what they don’t want but they’re not very good at what they do want and what they will accept.”: Leader: Leave and Remain must block no deal BrexitHe claimed contacts in Brussels have told him there is a feeling of wanting to help the UK but European leaders do not want to waste “political capital on something that they don’t think is going to satisfy the hard-line Brexiteers in the Conservative party”.Mr Masterton added: “I think that what the Prime Minister has to accept is that there’s probably a couple of dozen Conservative MPs that will not accept any kind of deal whatsoever.“So frankly she just needs to ignore them and write them off and look at where she can replace those votes from where in Parliament and build a better consensus and go back to Brussels on that basis.”Responding to former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab’s suggestion the EU was attempting to stop the UK leaving with “bullying” and “intransigent stubbornness”, Mr Masterton accused Brexiteers of “playing a very dangerous game”.He said: “The only people going to end up jeopardising Brexit and stopping us leaving are people like Dominic Raab.“For people like him and his ilk to complain of intransigence of anybody  is a little bit rich.”Mr Masterton said although he was worried about the isiveness of referendums, as witnessed in both the EU and Scottish independence campaigns, he said a second public vote would be better than leaving without a deal.“I have been very clear that for me this deal is a compromise, it is a compromise that is as far as I am prepared to go,” he said.“I want to deliver ion the UK referendum result but I’m not prepared to do it at any cost.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4856424.1547554529!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may set for massive defeat on her brexit deal","story":"Theresa May is braced for a potentially crushing Commons defeat for her Brexit deal after an eleventh hour appeal for support apparently failed to win round critics.On a historic day at Westminster MPs will finally deliver their verdict on the Withdrawal Agreement hammered out with Brussels on Tuesday evening.With more than  Tory MPs having declared their opposition to the plan, there was speculation the Government could go down to one of the heaviest defeats of modern times.: Nicola Sturgeon urges MPs to block BrexitThe Prime Minister has insisted she is focused on winning the vote - telling Conservative rebels on Monday evening they risked handing the keys of No  to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.However The Dailyquoted one Cabinet source as saying it would be “hard for her to carry on”she lost by more than  votes.The Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom insisted Mrs May was determined to continue fighting for her agreement in the best interests of the country.“Anything that looks like that level of disruption would incredibly bad - both for the country and for Brexit,” she told BBC’s Newsnight.“So I think the Prime Minister will remain determined to deliver on this deal.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1375347.jpg--.jpg?1546939693000\n","title":"vandals target dunclug play park","story":"A CHILDREN’S play park came under attack last weekend in the Dunclug area.Vandals daubed white paint over the mesh fence with splatters damaging the play surface.Offensive slogans were scrawled along the fence in what locals believe could be in relation to drug activity in the vicinity.The attack is believed to have happened overnight between Sunday evening and Monday morning.One of the slogans read F.A.G while another said D.T.U.S Scum.A local resident said there could be a link between the incident and the supply of drugs which is endemic in the area.The resident said it is believed that children or young teenagers were not the perpetrators.They said due to the size of the letters, which they estimate as being around six foot, it is believed that the unsightly graffiti is the work of adults.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Mrs May has called for politicians to back her deal or risk letting the British people down. But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated.MPs will also be able to suggest amendments that could reshape the deal before voting commences this evening.Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald TD has said the EU backstop cannot be set aside or diluted.Speaking from Stormont after she and Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill met leaders of the north’s main political parties, Mary Lou McDonald said: #Whatever transpires at Westminster it is essential that Irish interests are protected that the economy is protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected in all its parts.#We have commitments from our partners at an EU level that the needs of this island north and south have been recognised and will be protected. Sinn Féin expects those commitments to be honoured and that is what we have been making clear to the Irish government and the EU.#There is no such thing as a good Brexit but the backstop is the bottom line. Anyone who imagines that can be unpicked or diluted or set aside isn#t dealing with the political realities. The DUP position on Brexit is reckless and irresponsible. It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the north of Ireland. I would urge all political leaders to act in the interests of workers, of communities, of society and political stability.”DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said that Mrs May should ask for and deliver changes to a Withdrawal Agreement. Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the EU, he saidthere are “no legally binding assurances” as the Prime Minister talked about in December.“In fact, there is nothing new, nothing has changed,” he said. “Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands, there has been no change to the Withdrawal Agreement and Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. I stead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"eye on the past january 4","story":"Sad home coming for Mary and BillyIT was a sad Christmas for Mary and Billy Kennedy despite their release from internment on Christmas Eve. For the Kennedys – parents of seven children – found their maisonette home in Divis Flats in ruins when they ed to it just hours before Christmas.Ceilings and walls had been damaged, the bathroom completely wrecked and doors had been pulled off their hinges and were lying on the floor. “I was heartbroken when I saw the destruction,” said Mary as she sat in the home of her mother, Mrs Mary Brennan, in another part of Divis Flats. “The children told me that British soldiers had raided the house almost every day. Once they searched the house from top to bottom no less than five times,” she said. Mary who was interned in Armagh Jail since May last went on to say that the family would have to find a new home.“Our house just couldn’t be lived in now,” she said. As she sat with her husband Billy, interned for the second time in June last, she described how she was called to the office of Amagh Jail Governor Whitaker at  o’clock Christmas Eve morning.“I had no idea I was going to be released. Girls are often called to the office to receive the silliest of messages and I assumed he was going to tell me that a visit to Billy in Long Kesh which I had asked for had been turned down,” she said. “He read me a handwritten letter from Merlyn Rees which told me they were doing me a big favour by letting me out to be with the children at Christmas. I asked about my sister Evelyn Gilroy, who has two young babies, but he said that she was being kept in internment.”n THE milk Marketing Board has warned that all milk being obtained by householders during the present strike by milk roundsmen should be boiled before use.At present milk is being supplied to the area by farmers who are bringing it straight from their farms and the Board has warned that there could be a serious health hazardunpasturized milk is used without being boiled.Milk should be brought to boiling point and cooled as quickly as possible, says the Board. It should not be kept for long periods and bottles and other containers used for collecting milk supplies should be sterilized in boiling water before being used.Bernie to stand for electionBERNADETTE McAliskey is likely to be a candidate for the new Irish Republican Socialist Party in the forthcoming Northern Ireland Convention elections. She is already a member of the temporary executive of the new party.The Irish Republican Socialist Party is a breakaway from Official Sinn Féin. It is led by Wicklow County councillor Seamus Costello who over the years has been a prominent member of the Officials, but in recent times in dispute with the organisation.The breakaway formed itself into a new party following the recent Official Sinn Féin Ard Fheis. John Joe McGirl, recently released from Long Kesh, told a meeting of Leitrim County Council that he was familiar with the thinking of the UVF and the UDA and he was glad to see that many of them were “coming to see the true light”.He said that this was so even though some of their politicians were not serious about peace and were trying to wreck the current efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin county councillor went on to say that the policy of the republican movement was not to ask England to put up a white flag but simply to request them to disengage from this country.The issue was now in the hands of the British Government and he hoped they would come to the right conclusion.He said he was very pleased that the clergy had become involved in the peace drive and added that nobody desired peace in this country as much as the Provisional IRA. ‘End this evil’ call as some internees are freedAS  internees were released from Long Kesh and Armagh on New Year’s Eve the Association for Legal Justice called for an “end to this evil of internment”.Among those freed this week were three men who had been held as internees since August  . They were Lenadoon man Gerry Maguire, Mickey Donnelly from Derry City – one of the ‘hooded men’ – and Art McAlinden from South Armagh.Mother of two, Mrs Evelyn Gilroy , from Divis Flats, was reunited with her children Coletteand Deniseminutes after she had been released from Armagh Jail where she has been interned since May. She was the only girl internee released from Armagh.Former Sinn Féin TD John Joe McGirl, who was lted on Andersonstown Road as he travelled to Milltown Cemetery from his County Leitrim home for last Easter’s commemoration ceremony was also set free. His internment had brought protest resolutions from local councils throughout Ireland, including Leitrim County Council of which he was a member.In a comment on the releases Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee joined the ALJ in demanding the immediate closure of Long Kesh.Speaking on behalf of Andersonstown rent and rates strikers, the Committee welcomed the releases – but it warned that the strike should continue until the last internees has been set free.The resistance group’s statement said that the spirit with which the internees endured their torture and suffering was admired by all.“There will be no thanks from us, or from the people of Andersonstown, to the British government for these releases. The men and boys in Long Kesh and the girls in Armagh should never have been parted from their families in the first place,” concluded the statement.There has been ied reaction to a plea from Fr Des Wilson that policing in areas from which the RUC is excluded should be put in the hands of local community associations.Andersonstown Central Civil Resistance Committee has described Fr Wilson’s suggestion as “forward looking” but in a statement the Committee goes on to warn that no police service which co-operates with the RUC will have the support of the people of Andersonstown or the Falls. “There is no chance of the RUC ever being accepted in Andersonstown.”Meanwhile, RUC men took advantage of the truce to set up a road block near the main gate of Falls Park on Boxing Day.

This playground is a major attraction for families and children, not only from Balmoral but indeed much further afield, as it is part of the fantastic natural resource that is the Lagan Valley Regional Park.“The playground will be closed for around three months whilst the site is levelled and landscaped and a range of new equipment is installed.”Cllr McAteer said the refurbishment will ensure that the play park will be inclusive of children who have disabilities.“New equipment includes a roundabout which is wheelchair friendly, sit-in rockers for small children with disabilities and basket sit-in swings for more senior children as well as slides and climbing frames which have transfer stations which will be wheelchair friendly.”“It’s a wonderful design and Council staff have done a great job in bringing the project to shovel ready stage. Weather permitting, it should be in great shape and opened for the spring.”The new-look playground will also benefit from new safety features including a new three metre pedestrian crossing to the playground, finished in tactile paving and new anti-vandal park benches. Sections of broken fencing will be removed and replaced and existing vegetation at the site entrance will be cut back to improve sight lines."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"patricias latest work set to banish january blues with latest work","story":"MONDAY morning and a trip across the city to the old Belfast politan College on Tower Street ,whose beauty and hair salon is proving the perfect rehearsal space for Patricia Gormley’s latest work ‘Is That Too Hot ’Set in the world of hairdryers, rollers, straighteners and all things beauty, the hilarious sequel to ‘I’ll Tell My Ma’ is heading to The MAC stage this month to lt our spirits during the post-holiday slump.West Belfast scribe Patricia, who has performed her work across the city on many stages from the Cultúrlann to the Lyric, in her new play traces the antics of Granny Eileen, Davina Carina and Cha Marie as they stumble their way through another year in their ever turbulent lives as they pop in and out of their local hairdressers for a cuppa, a ‘curly blowdry’ and a catch-up.Starring Christina Nelson, who brought Patricia’s work and characters to le on the Lyric stage last year, and Roisin Gallagher, both actors told Daily Belfast how audiences are in for a treat when curtain comes up.“I play the character of Olive, in whose salon the stories of each character unfold in,” explained Roisin. “Olive has her own drama going on which the audience find out about throughout the piece. It is based on a real le person and hairdressers in the heart of West Belfast. It’s a brilliant observational piece and it’s a story about what happens at the heart of any community that has people who are lonely, struggling, having relationship problems and maybe don’t have anyone to speak to and are coming to this place for their own needs once a week. As Olive says in the play, “This place is like a psychiatrist’s couch, only they get to sit in a swivel chair. The character of Olive hears more about what is going on than the priest,” she laughed.Fresh from her stint as the white rabbit in the Lyric’s Alice the Musical, Christina Nelson is preparing to transform once again into a iety of roles for this sequel. “Granny Eileen, feisty as ever, is back, bless her, back from Turkey where she had a great old time. Cha Marie is back and Patricia has written a new character, Mrs Hughes, who is a bit of a prickly one and worth a watching.”Christina continued: “The energy with Roisin is brilliant, we are working brilliantly together and we are working our socks off to make sure those coming to see us will be laughing in their seats.“So much of everyday le is heard and discussed in the hairdressers, some people even just go to sit under the dryer to get a bit of heat, get a cup of tea brought to them. It’s very much a social thing and they are very much embedded throughout communities.”When asked about plans for a trilogy, Christina revealed that Patricia is “writing as we speak.” “Granny Eileen will definitely be back and there is more to come for these characters.”The new production will reunite Roisin with her recent Bah, Humbug! co-star Alan McKee, who this time will be sitting in the director’s chair. The former St Genevieve’s High School pupil will also be bringing her own work to The MAC stage in March with the self-penned Natural Disaster. “I wrote this piece, it’s what I would call a creative documentation, after my daddy passed away last Christmas. It’s like a journey through grief and I had documented things during that time that were said whether they were funny and sad. It’s not all doom and gloom, though, it’s how we look at grief, how we carry it with us and it will be great to perform it at The MAC following our run with this show.”“You can’t help but fall in love with these characters,” said Roisin. “It’s the perfect tonic for people needing a lt in January to put their worries away for an hour or two and come and see the show.”Is That Too Hot runs at The MAC from January  until February .

I don’t think she even asked to get rid of the backstop.”In the final day of debate on Mrs May’s deal, Mr Cox acknowledged that the agreement reached with the EU in November was not perfect, but said he was supporting it “for wholly pragmatic reasons”.“It is the necessary means to secure our orderly departure and unlock our future outside the European Union,” he told MPs.Thousands of businesses with contracts based on EU law would find “the rug pulled from under ”the UK left with a deal, he said.They would ask MPs: “What are you playing at  What are you doing  You are not children in the playground, you are legislators’,” Mr Cox said, adding: “We are playing with people’s lives.”Mr Cox compared the Withdrawal Agreement to an “airlock” providing a route towards a future trade and security relationship with the remaining  EU states.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Prime Minister Theresa May listens to the Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox, speak in the House of Commons debate on her Brexit plan But the Labour chair of the Brexit Select Committee Hilary Benn retorted: “The reason why many of us will vote against the deal tonight is because on the other side of the second airlock is a complete vacuum about our future relationship with our biggest, nearest and most important trading partners.”Mrs May’s deal came under assault from a series of MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate, with eurosceptics warning that it failed to resolve their concerns that the backstop arrangements designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland could become permanent.The Tory chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee Sir Bill Cash called on  Mrs May to “consider her position”, comparing it to Neville Chamberlain’s resignation  in  which cleared the way for Sir Winston Churchill to take over.“Now is the time to walk away from the intransigence of the EU and our failed policy of seeking to supplicate their guidelines, their terms and their paymasters,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Anti-Brexit and Pro-Brexit protesters fly flags outside the Houses of Parliament In the final Cabinet meeting before the crucial vote, Mrs May told senior ministers that the Government was “the servant of the people” and she believed “passionately” that it must deliver on the result of the referendum, in which voters opted to Leave by a margin of %-%.She spent much of the day meeting Tory MPs in her Commons office in an eleventh-hour bid to bolster support.But analysis of polling released by the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum suggested that around % of voters – including majorities in every region of the country – want a public voteParliament proves unable to decide on a Brexit deal.German foreign minister Heiko Maas said Brexit talks would continueMrs May’s deal was rejected by MPs, but there was unlikely to be “substantial” change to the agreement.Mr Maas said: “If there were still a solution that could be presented under even greater pressure, I would ask myself why it has not been put on the table before in order to ensure that this evening’s vote takes place under better circumstances.“That is why I believe that the agreement is as it stands and will not be substantially changed, but that,things go wrong tonight, there will certainly be talks again.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp calls on pm to consider her position over brexit deal vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

veteran Conservative MP has called on the Prime Minister to “consider her position and to do so with dignity and without rancour” over her Brexit deal vote..pushSir Bill Cash argued it was “time to walk away from the intransigence of the EU and our failed policy”.Speaking in the Commons, the MP for Stone said he believed Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement “will be consigned to the grave of history”, adding Mrs May’s deal was “not compromise as the Attorney General suggested, it is capitulation….we are defending our democracy against servitude”.He said: “Far from MPs, as the Prime Minister has asserted, voting for this agreement it is our duty to vote against it.”I believe, therefore, there are lessons in this for the Prime Minister to consider her position and to do so with dignity and without rancourSir Bill CashFacebookTwitterSupporting the deal he argued would undermine the Westminster system of government, depriving the country of “monumental opportunities of global trading on our own terms and with our friends in the United States who are so disillusioned with this agreement”.He added: “I would strongly urge the Government, therefore, after this vote is cast tonight to conclude that enough is enough and that we have reached the journey’s end.“Now is the time to walk away from the intransigence of the EU and our failed policy of seeking to supplicate their guidelines, their terms and their paymasters.“We witnessed similar events in May  when the then prime minister actually won the vote on the Norway debate but on reflection concluded that he had to resign because he had lost the confidence of Parliament as a whole.“I believe,therefore, there are lessons in this for the Prime Minister to consider her position and to do so with dignity and without rancour.”Father of the House and Tory Remainer Ken Clarke said he was being “pragmatic” in supporting the Withdrawal Agreement “to minimise the damage” of Brexit.The MP for Rushclfe said: “The vote on invoking Article  revealed to me there is not the slightest chance of persuading the present House of Commons to give up leaving the EU because they’re terried of denying the EU referendum.“To be fair to my friends, who are hardline Brexiteers and always have been, none of them had the slightest intention of taking any notice of the referendum.“But it is now a kind of religiously binding commitment it seems to the majority of this House that we must leave, so we are leaving.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab Former chancellor Mr Clarke accused arch-Brexiteers of “paranoia” over claims the Irish backstop is some sort of plot to prevent Brexit.He suggested the UK should revoke Article  “as a means of delay”, saying there is not time to get all the necessary legislation through Parliament to exit the EU on March .Tory former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said Mrs May’s deal was a compromise too far.He said: “I’ve always understood the case for compromise but compromise cannot come at any price.“The deal before us involves the most severe and enduring risk for our economy our democracy, while stling the opportunities of Brexit that fired up over  million with optimism and hope to vote in June .”Mr Raab said the best alternative was a no-deal Brexit, leaving on World Trade Organisationterms.“This deal is so demeaning to our country it would inevitably invite, no demand, reversal by the British people from the moment the ink was dry,” he said.“It would torment us for the foreseeable future.“If this deal is voted down we should make our best final offer, including an ability to exit the backstop and transition to a best in class free trade agreement and at the same time we must accelerate our preparations for leaving on WTO terms in case all reasonable offers are rebuffed in Brussels.”"},{"url":null,"title":"do your duty nonleague boreham wood urge mps to vote down brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  |

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem.

Picture by Arthur Allison Pacemaker.Robert Maxwell from Clough and his friend Nigel Cree from Seaforde are two ex-servicemen involved in Let’s Do, a charity which aims to aid physically and mentally injured veteran’s rehabilitation through outdoor group events.The UK-wide charity is most active in the Isle of Man, but the Clough pair want to add to the charity’s outdoor assets in Northern Ireland.They are in the process of setting up a fishing retreat at Kennedy’s Bog – located by farmland owned by Robert’s father – which they hope will be ready by the summer. Nigel said: “What we’ve decided to do is turn it into a fishery that the charity can use to let veterans fish and relax a bit. We’ve also got the Mournes right beside us so that’s another outdoor activity they can do while they’re here.Our reporter gets some fishing tip from ex-serviceman Nigel Cree. Picture by Arthur Allison Pacemaker.“This is our baby. There’s projects where in the UK but we want to have something to offer in Northern Ireland for veterans here or from where in the UK to come over.”Robert said: “To start off we cleaned the lake out – you were getting four to five foot of water and then five to six foot of pure sludge.“Then Nigel and I built a bridge over the lake. Next we’ll be building two fishing stands.”The bridge and two fishing stands are to be named after servicemen who died during the Troubles, or later as a result of injuries suffered during the conflict.Of the river’s fishing potential, Nigel said: “Originally there were rudd in it. The ministrygave us some more rudd, perch and tench. They put about  in plus there would already have been a natural head of . We have a decent head of fish in there.” A keen fisherman himself, Nigel added: “I think anything which helps people relax and they’re in good company has got to be of benefit.“The activity is what we can offer to get them out of the house, but it’s really about the company.”Log burners and house coal to be banned in fight against air pollution Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Robert said: “We could be facilitating over  veterans in a year easily. Who we’re aiming for are guys who are either mentally or physically disabled.”Robert’s Army career ended as a result of the injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident in .He lost an arm in the hit and run crash and he also suffered head injuries and nerve damage. Since then Robert has suffered from PTSD .He said: “I was in a bad way – physically and mentally. You can fix the body but the mind isn’t as easy to repair. PTSD never really goes away.“Through our charity we’re treating disabled veterans like ordinary iniduals and not patronising them.“We can’t offer financial support but we can offer peer support.”After his accident Robert volunteered in a pastoral care role offering support to injured military veterans.This led to the the development of Let’s Do veteran’s support charity, set up in .Let’s Do is a veteran run charity which has helped people overcome disabilities since .The main aim of the charity is to help ex-servicemen and women to come to terms with injuries and disabilities – such as amputees, those with limited vision, partial paralysis and PTSD – through outdoor activities that will encourage them to become involved and help them to grow confidence whilst becoming comfortable with their disabilities.For more information see www.letsdoevents.infoWhen Robert’s marriage fell apart, his we stayed in the family home while Robert moved into a wooden cabin on his father’s farm.Robert wants the cabin to form phase two of the fishing project by renovating it to allow fellow veterans to stay over for respite.Nigel commented: “Through the course of our work we learn about people who have chosen a le of isolation because of PTSD and injuries suffered during their service.“For instance we’ve learnt about a guy who is so depressed that he hasn’t left the house in eight years. He used to fish. I’m hoping we can use that to get him out of the house.“There are people out there who feel abandoned. Largely men. Quite a lot have been in a family, their marriage has collapsed, they live in isolation.”Robert added: “Big military charities generate lots of money, but they’ve become corporate and ex-servicemen who need help most are falling through the cracks.“It’s the guys who we know about who are being ignored because they’re not high profile enough, there’s no publicity mileage in them.“Funding for our charity is very ad hoc. In fishing terms we’re the minnows.“We don’t have a great deal of budget and volunteers, but those who are involved work extremely hard.”Asked , considering the trauma he has suffered, he still would have signed up to join the army, Robert said: “Yes, my biggest regret is not being able to achieve more in the service. I can see why there is recruiting issues now when you look at the way the veterans are being treated.”try catch  TrendingMourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsTragedy: Two men die in separate Mourne Mountains fallsPSNI appeal for parents to know where your children are - after -year-old rushed to AE with vodka intoxicationGlenn Irwin: I want record six wins at this years North West Log burners and house coal to be banned in fight against air pollution          ..

Her purpose is to leave the European Union in line with what people voted for. She could not be clearer about that.”The deal suffered its first official parliamentary defeat in the House of Lords on Monday night as peers voted by  votes to  - a majority of  - to reject it.Mr Corbyn indicated he was finally ready to table a vote of no-confidence in the Governmentit loses in the Commons.“Don’t be concerned, it’s coming soon,” he told a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party.It would appear unlikely Labour can muster enough votes to force a general election, with both Tory rebels and the DUP indicating they would continue to back the Government in a confidence vote.However Downing Street has given little indication as to how the Prime Minister intends to proceedshe is defeated.Irish interests must be protected in Brexit, says Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Under the terms of an amendment passed last week, she must table a motion on her Plan B by Monday - although in practice she is unlikely to want to wait that long.Some reports have suggested she could fly to Brussels - possibly as early as Wednesday - in an attempt wring further concessions on the crucial issue of the Northern Ireland “backstop”.But that could prove problematicshe has suffered a massive defeat, with EU leaders reluctant to give groundthey believe it is simply impossible for her to get the deal through the Commons.Alternatively, she could to bring back the deal to the House for a second - or possibly even a third - time in an attempt to wear down the opposition.Some MPs claimed to have detected some movement towards her position after she addressed a private meeting of Conservatives MPs at Westminster on Monday evening.So far, however, the numbers contemplating backing the deal would appear to fall far short of what is needed to affect the final outcome.Mrs May will make her final appeal when she winds up five days of debate in the Commons before MPs head to the ision lobbies.Voting is due to begin at pm and could continue for around two hours, depending on how many amendments Speaker John Bercow calls before the final “meaningful vote” on the deal.Those tabled include one by the Labour MP and chairman of the Commons Exiting the EU Committee Hilary Benn intended to block both Mrs May’s deal and a no-deal Brexit.Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Mrs May acknowledged the deal was “not perfect” but urged MPs to give it a “second look”.With some pro-Remain MPs backing moves to take control of the parliamentary timetableshe is defeated, she warned any attempt by the House to thwart Brexit would be a “subversion of our democracy”.On Monday, Conservative former ministers Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan put forward a plan to give Parliament control over the Brexit process.Their European Union Withdrawal Number  Bill would give the Government three weeks to seek a compromise that can get through the Commons and allow the UK to leave the EU on March  as planned.If that failed, the Liaison Committee - made up of senior backbenchers who chair Commons committees - would be given the job of coming up with its own compromise deal, which the Government would be legally required to implementapproved by MPs.However, Liaison Committee chairman Sarah Wollaston poured cold water on the proposal, saying backbenchers constitutionally “cannot take over conducting a complex international negotiation”.try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.Mourne Mountain Rescue team release statement on tragic day which saw two walkers die after fallsAlex Kane: Karen Bradleyrsquos border poll talk both stupid and deliberately provocative          ..

I don’t think she even asked to get rid of the backstop.”In the final day of debate on Mrs May’s deal, Mr Cox acknowledged that the agreement reached with the EU in November was not perfect, but said he was supporting it “for wholly pragmatic reasons”.“It is the necessary means to secure our orderly departure and unlock our future outside the European Union,” he told MPs.Thousands of businesses with contracts based on EU law would find “the rug pulled from under ”the UK left with a deal, he said.They would ask MPs: “What are you playing at  What are you doing  You are not children in the playground, you are legislators’,” Mr Cox said, adding: “We are playing with people’s lives.”Mr Cox compared the Withdrawal Agreement to an “airlock” providing a route towards a future trade and security relationship with the remaining  EU states.But the Labour chair of the Brexit Select Committee Hilary Benn retorted: “The reason why many of us will vote against the deal tonight is because on the other side of the second airlock is a complete vacuum about our future relationship with our biggest, nearest and most important trading partners.”Mrs May’s deal came under assault from a series of MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate, with eurosceptics warning that it failed to resolve their concerns that the backstop arrangements designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland could become permanent.The Tory chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee Sir Bill Cash called on Mrs May to “consider her position”, comparing it to Neville Chamberlain’s resignation in  which cleared the way for Sir Winston Churchill to take over.“Now is the time to walk away from the intransigence of the EU and our failed policy of seeking to supplicate their guidelines, their terms and their paymasters,” he said.In the final Cabinet meeting before the crucial vote, Mrs May told senior ministers that the Government was “the servant of the people” and she believed “passionately” that it must deliver on the result of the referendum, in which voters opted to Leave by a margin of %-%.She spent much of the day meeting Tory MPs in her Commons office in an eleventh-hour bid to bolster support.But analysis of polling released by the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum suggested that around % of voters - including majorities in every region of the country - want a public voteParliament proves unable to decide on a Brexit deal.German foreign minister Heiko Maas said Brexit talks would continueMrs May’s deal was rejected by MPs, but there was unlikely to be “substantial” change to the agreement.Mr Maas said: “If there were still a solution that could be presented under even greater pressure, I would ask myself why it has not been put on the table before in order to ensure that this evening’s vote takes place under better circumstances.“That is why I believe that the agreement is as it stands and will not be substantially changed, but that,things go wrong tonight, there will certainly be talks again.”try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.This photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. manwith dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help with dementia is missing - P.S.N.I. issue urgent appeal for help\"          ..

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join. There are no auditions and no previous choir experience is needed.The concert saw many people turn up to enjoy the music alongside a iety of refreshments.Dafydd Jones, administrator of the Parish of All Saints Church and organiser of the Music at Lunchtime programme of concerts, said the concert was a great way to start the season.He said: \"An enjoyable time was had by all - audience and performers who have, by the way, expressed a willingness, nay an enthusiasm, to come back for amatch next year.\"After welcoming the audience and thanking them for their attendance, I introduced the Town Mayor, Cllr Jon Luxton who spoke briefly about Music at Lunchtime, the Barry Community Choir and All Saints Church also expressed a desire to come back for other concerts in the future.\"The choir performed a most enjoyable pot-pourri of songs from the shows amongst many others and ended up with a foot-tapping medley of World War One favourites. All in all, a heart-warming programme of music, appreciated by everyone.\"This yearrsquos autumn programme of recitals at All Saints Church continues throughout October and November with an exciting mix of vocal and instrumental soloists and ensembles.All Saints Church is accessible to the disabled and the elderly and also boasts creche facilities. Refreshments, including teas, coffees, cold drinks and cake are offered on the gallery and the audience is welcome to bring along their lunch to the concerts.Full details of the autumn programme of concerts can be found on posters around Penarth and also on the churchrsquos website - allsaintspenarth.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

We will oppose the toxic backstop  vote against the WA. Itrsquos time for a sensible deal which governs our exit from the EU  supports all parts of the UK.mdash Arlene FosterJanuary , Confirming that the  DUP MPs will not back the PMrsquos deal, party leader Arlene Foster told a press conference in London:ldquoWe said to the Prime Minister she had to get rid of the backstop and get a Withdrawal Agreement that can be lived with. I donrsquot think she even asked to get rid of the backstop.In the final day of debate on Mrs Mayrsquos deal, Mr Cox acknowledged that the agreement reached with the EU in November was not perfect, but said he was supporting it ldquofor wholly pragmatic reasons.ldquoIt is the necessary means to secure our orderly departure and unlock our future outside the European Union, he told MPs.Thousands of businesses with contracts based on EU law would find ldquothe rug pulled from under the UK left with a deal, he said.They would ask MPs: ldquoWhat are you playing at  What are you doing  You are not children in the playground, you are legislatorsrsquo, Mr Cox said, adding: ldquoWe are playing with peoplersquos lives.Mr Cox compared the Withdrawal Agreement to an ldquoairlock providing a route towards a future trade and security relationship with the remaining  EU states.Prime Minister Theresa May listens to the Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox, speak in the House of Commons debate on her Brexit plan But theLabour chair of theBrexit Select Committee Hilary Benn retorted: ldquoThe reason why many of us will vote against the deal tonight is because on the other side of the second airlock is a complete vacuum about our future relationship with our biggest, nearest and most important trading partners.Mrs Mayrsquos deal came under assault from a series of MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate, with eurosceptics warning that it failed to resolve their concerns that the backstop arrangements designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland could become permanent.TheTory chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee Sir Bill Cash called on Mrs May to ldquoconsider her position, comparing it to Neville Chamberlainrsquos resignation in  which cleared the way for Sir Winston Churchill to take over.ldquoNow is the time to walk away from the intransigence of the EU and our failed policy of seeking to supplicate their guidelines, their terms and their paymasters, he said.Anti-Brexit and Pro-Brexit protesters fly flags outside the Houses of Parliament In the final Cabinet meeting before the crucial vote, Mrs May told senior ministers that the Government was ldquothe servant of the people and she believed ldquopassionately that it must deliver on the result of the referendum, in which voters opted to Leave by a margin of %-%.She spent much of the day meeting Tory MPs in her Commons office in an eleventh-hour bid to bolster support.But analysis of polling released by the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum suggested that around % of voters ndash including majorities in every region of the country ndash want a public voteParliament proves unable to decide on a Brexit deal.German foreign minister Heiko Maas said Brexit talks would continueMrs Mayrsquos deal was rejected by MPs, but there was unlikely to be ldquosubstantial change to the agreement.Mr Maas said: ldquoIf there were still a solution that could be presented under even greater pressure, I would ask myself why it has not been put on the table before in order to ensure that this eveningrsquos vote takes place under better circumstances.ldquoThat is why I believe that the agreement is as it stands and will not be substantially changed, but that,things go wrong tonight, there will certainly be talks again..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Theresa May calls on MPs to  udo their duty u and back her Brexit deal article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Lurgan campus has long been regarded as wholly inadequate in terms of facilities.Parents at Monday night’s meeting voiced their opposition to the plans amid calls for the children from the Lurgan campus to be accommodated at Lurgan Junior High School in an - school - retaining academic selection at age  for pupils to move on to Lurgan College.Parents were warned ‘not to be bamboozled by figures’ after EA officials outlined the case for their proposals and their reasons for rejecting other alternatives.Indeed there were weary laughs of derision as EA official Michael McConkey outlined the advantages or the Portadown solution and the Lurgan option - with a much shorter list for the Lurgan case. One parent pointed out many of the points made in favour of Portadown could - and should - be included in the case for Lurgan.A former governor at Craigavon Senior High and also a governor at the junior High, Mr Tom McKay, questioned a £. million deficit that officials said the senior high was running at.Stressing he was speaking in a personal capacity he asked what proportion of that deficit was due to pupil fluctuations in a two year school, pointing out: “Some will be due to running a split site school, but not all.”He went on to say: “Running a two year school was always going to be a risky business.”He pointed to the effect fluctuating pupil numbers could have as they could lose  pupils in a year which could have a signicant impact on the school budget.He added: “You talk about moving pupils to Portadown but its still going to be a two year school, it is always going to be subject to times of stress.”One key point of the discussions with regard to the ‘Lurgan solution’ was the EA’s insistence on protecting the Dickson Plan - which sees academic selection delayed to age  in this area. Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"The EA pointed to a statement made by DUP Education Minister Peter Weir on June ,  in defence of the Dickson Plan.He said at that time: “I want to assure people locally that I will be offering support and assurance for the continuation of the Dickson Plan system, and will be ushering in a period of educational stability on the issue. This is something that works, and so I will ensure that the Dickson Plan is not removed either directly or undermined through stealth, and that any threat is now lted.”Mr McKay: “We are paving over the cracks and stripping Lurgan of all these young people and all to satisfy the statement of a minister.“To say creating an - school in Lurgan could be perceived as weakening the Dickson Plan - that is very suspect. I support the Dickson Plan in as far as the Dickson Plan is selection at . This is not a detraction from the Dickson Plan.”It was a point which struck a definite chord with those at the meeting who applauded his remarks. He added the Dickson Plan did need to be changed with the colleges in Lurgan and Portadown taking more than the average number of pupils while the senior high school pupils were the “most vulnerable in society.”He commended the work done by the teachers at the senior high: “If it wasn’t for their hard work it would have failed long ago.”Another parent pointed to Peter Weir’s remarks and said: “Do not hold us to ransom for a man who was in a government that doesn’t exist anymore.”A number of speakers articulated the Lurgan solution while other expressed their practical concerns over bussing children to Portadown - especially from outlying villages.One pointed out: “A review is being carried out which could see bus passes taken away so it could cost you £ a year to get a child to a school you did not choose.”The EA officials stated the consultation was the start of the process rather than the end but a decision would be based on educational considerations rather than weight of numbers.try catch  TrendingOutrage as dirty needles found near play areaPolice hunt lsquoMike Tysonrsquo wannabe after manrsquos ear bitten in attackDamaged roof leads to part of Craigavon shopping centre being cordoned offBoyarrested on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon close to a school arrested on suspicion of carrying an offensive weapon close to a school\"Shock and disbelief after kids fire massive kne at door of family home          ..

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.

In addition to the uncertainties of managing the economy, which face the Government, there is a huge element of uncertainty about the reliability of the conventional economic forecasts. How disruptive will be the consequences of Brexit implementation  Northern Ireland goes into  with an economy that is growing, but growing only very slowly. While the UK economy has recovered the output levels lost during the recession of the past decade, Northern Ireland in - still has overall output % lower than in . In contrast, the Irish economy has regained a rate of economic growth that is better than the UK and compares well with the EU average.There is now an emerging picture of the UK economy growing more slowly than the EU average and, within the UK, Northern Ireland has one of the slowest regional improvements, lagging behind the rest of the UK. The international prospects for  are now forecast to be less expansionary than last year and the OECD points to slower trade growth in  linked to disruption of international trade partly linked with the more restrictive trade policies of the US and also to tightening changes in monetary and fiscal policies.Northern Ireland’s slower growth is set to continue. Political instability and Brexit uncertainties continue to be a concern. The most recent annual business enquiry, reporting on the outcome in , shows the stark contrasts. In , the non-financial business economy here expanded at a rate of .%: the rate for the UK was .%. All this in the run up to the finalBrexit deal which is widely expected to have a further initial adverse impact and, later, may go either way to give a boost or restrain, further ahead. Brexit, in whatever form it eventually takes, adds a considerable degree of uncertainty. The conventional models to anticipate how the economy will behave are attracting a degree of scepticism well beyond just the margin of error that might be expected. When otherwise well established and well understood agencies such as the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England attract ill-informed criticism, usually by critics who have little understanding of the inter-action of the main economic iables and the professional competence of the authors, the consequence is a lack of rational measured influence.Critical political comments on prospects for the economy in  are heavily discounting the negative assessments. As the year evolves, the answer to the non-professional critics will lie in the evidence as the unfolding trends confirm that pessimism about the impact of Brexit is well merited.At the risk of being challenged,the conclusion proves misplaced, the prospects for Northern Ireland in  are not reassuring.  In the opening days of ,business decisions can be postponed, chances are that they will. Writing in December for an analysis of business prospects in the following year is, this time, more hazardous than any other recent period. No matter what decisions are made in Westminster, each month in  will reveal a new set of influences each, in dferent ways, recalibrating the economic arithmetic for the months ahead.The real cautionary ideal would be to ‘lock the doors and keep everything inside’ until the external economic environment settled down. Of course that would make a risky situation even riskier. Business managers must manage their business and ‘locking the doors’ is a guaranteed crisis or collapse. Businesses will keep trading, responding to changing market pressures, and hoping that the unexpected economic and political shocks are manageable.The least complicated and most reliable basis for decision making in the early part of  is that there continues to be a major degree of uncertainty about how the economy will respond to events, some of which may have erse implications. Decisions can often be readily postponed. Delay can be less stressful than anticipation of the uncertain.The critical uncertainties include:The final form of Brexit to be agreed by the UK Government and the EU Have the exchange rates for the pound and euro stabilised How will the Bank of England respond: base rate could further increase After Brexit, how will the UK Chancellor respond in the next Budget The answers to these uncertainties are critically important for the UK and, specically, Northern Ireland. To a signicant degree, people in Northern Ireland are not in a position to set the answers. UK politics will be influential. However, that is not an excuse to argue that all responsibility lies outside local control.How will the Northern Ireland institutions respond If there is still no devolved Executive, the ‘no decision’ making drt will be an ever increasing negative influence. If, perchance, the Executive is reformed, how long will it take to regain lost momentum  Capital budgets in particular have slowed gradually as old contracts were finished. New contracts will take time to move from approval ‘to spades in the ground’.Even more critical, the private sector of the economy may be disappointed as domestic consumers continue to take a precautionary stance as they react to an increase in job insecurity and take a more pessimistic view of their expenditure needs.The prospects for  can be summed up either as challenges or opportunities awaiting sensible momentum. Can the negative Brexit messages give way to a more widely supported Brexit settlement  Can the negative impact of the local political stand-points be by-passed as the evidence of mutual gain from an agreed and restored Executive are realised  Is there a will to introduce a constructive programme for Government which really puts the economyfirst  The economic forecasters have good reason for their warnings of a post-Brexit bump. Even critics of the forecasters will have to accept that pervasive and persuasive logic must be acknowledged. It is time to ‘batten down the hatches’ and persevere.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mo_1.jpg","title":"two tech firms setting up in belfast city centre","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Two UK tech firms are setting up shop in one of Belfast’s newly revamped city centre buildings, Ulster Business can reveal.Tech firms CYTI and Firemelon, which are both owned by David Corney, will take on the fourth and fth floors of Moneda House, at Wellington Place.
