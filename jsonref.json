(Picture: Tanzeel Ur Rehman Cover Asia Press)Two obese sisters in India who have spent half their lives battling breathing problems have finally had surgery on their stomachs to lose weight – thanks to the kindness of an Indian surgeon.Yogita, eight, and sister Amisha, six, weighed a massive 22 stone combined at their heaviest.Their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 36, from a village in Gujarat, western India, said: ‘I cannot tell you how overjoyed we are. It’s been a long journey to get here and getting the right help with the right results.‘But we can already see results. We can see their features, they look like little girls. We are very happy and excited to see them getting better.’Their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 36, from a village in Gujarat, western India, said: ‘I cannot tell you how overjoyed we are.

I used to always be worried about feeding my always-hungry children.‘I couldn’t leave them cry hungry. And when I had no money, I borrowed it from my brothers and friends.’Even when their diet reduced to two chapatis and mixed vegetable broth for lunch and dinner, the girls continued to gain weight.

(Picture: Tanzeel Ur Rehman Cover Asia Press)Dr Narwaria promised Rameshbhai help, free of charge, and offered the sisters surgery to reduce their stomachs and long term consultations and guidance on permanent weight loss and a course of hormones and vitamins.‘I had seen the sisters in the newspapers,’ Dr Narwaria said.Thief caught red-handed is pushed out of first-floor window‘But I always thought they would call or the government would get in touch for my help.

I don’t like it. I want to lose weight so I can jump around with my friends.’ (Picture: Cover Asia Productions)Last month, on March 6, Yogita and Amisha were taken into surgery to have a portion of their stomachs removed.By the next day, the girls were on a liquid only diet. And after seven days they began to slowly eat solid foods again, but much smaller portions.Boy, 12, steals mum\u0027s card, takes flight to Bali then spends four nights in 4* hotelWith no fuss at all, the girls were happy to follow their new diet plan, realising they were ‘too fat’.Before surgery, Yogita said: ‘One boy in my neighbourhood calls me ‘fatty’ and it makes me sad.

We used to think that if they cried for food then we had to feed them.‘We quickly realised that we had to be strict. But even when they had smaller meals they continued to gain weight. We felt hopeless.‘Together, as a team, we’ll now make sure our girls have a hope of a healthier future.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_8398959.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"queen elizabeth ages turns 92","story":"Queen Elizabeth turns 92 today!

Piers with Wenger in 2000. He has since grown tired of his team\u0027s poor performances and has been calling for him to goThis season has been even worse than that.We\u0027re currently 6th in the League, out of both domestic competitions, and all that\u0027s left to play for is the Europa League, the ugly sister to the Cinderella-style Champions League that no big club wants to play in.As performances on the field have fallen, so has the size of the crowds.The Emirates stadium, supposedly our bold new platform to the elite of world football, has resembled a half-empty graveyard at times during recent games.Yet still Wenger\u0027s excuses have kept coming there\u0027s always a reason for our persistent failure in big competition, which has nothing to do with him.In the end, there is one statistic that says it all: Sir Alex Ferguson has won the Premier League five times since Wenger last won it, and he\u0027s been retired for five years.It\u0027s been so sad to see the slow, inexorable demise of our once great titan.          Some Arsenal fans have long waged a campaign calling for Wenger to be sackedArsenal legend Ian Wright put it well recently: \u0027Watching Wenger now is like witnessing the ageing Muhammad Ali against Larry Holmes or Brazil\u0027s Ronaldo when he got fat. The problem with Arsène is there is no one in his corner prepared to throw in the towel.\u0027Well, now he\u0027s done it himself.Or perhaps he was urged to throw it by board members at Arsenal? I know at least one who told me a few months ago he was hoping to persuade Wenger to finally see the writing on the wall.It doesn\u0027t really matter.Wenger\u0027s going and it\u0027s the end of one of the longest and most extraordinary reigns by any manager of any football club.          Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to beIt\u0027s a bitter-sweet moment, even for people like me who\u0027ve been demanding it happen for nearly a decade.Before the comparative misery of recent years – just three (devalued) FA Cup wins in 14 years is not a return \u0027big club\u0027 fans paying the highest ticket prices in Europe should reasonably accept - Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans.We won the Double in his first season 19978, and again in 2002.Then in 2004, we became the first – and to date ONLY – team to go through an entire English league season unbeaten.The \u0027Invincibles\u0027 as they became known were a dazzling side, bursting with incredible talent like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, and a ferocious fighting spirit led by captain Patrick Vieira that cowed many opponents into submission before the game even started.When we won the League that season, at the home of our bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, I was a guest of Lord Sugar\u0027s in the Spurs boardroom.Understandably, it had emptied long before Arsenal\u0027s players stopped celebrating out on the pitch.(Sugar was half way back to Chigwell before the final whistle, so desperate was he to avoid my inevitable gloating.)In fact, there was just me and my dad, ironically a lifelong Spurs fan, left when the door suddenly swung upon, and in walked Wenger and his long time No2, Pat Rice.I embraced them both like they were surgeons who\u0027d just saved my life – arguably, preposterously, this achievement felt even sweeter than that.Then I ordered the most expensive bottle of French red wine the boardroom stocked, at Lord Sugar\u0027s expense obviously, and the four of us sat alone together for an hour chatting about football.I met Wenger many times in those glorious early years and football was pretty much all he ever talked about.But he did it with such passion and knowledge.As anyone in the game will attest, Wenger\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with football.          Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans and he\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with footballHis idea of a great night is sitting at home watching a lower league Swedish reserve game on TV.For my part, that hour I spent in the Spurs boardroom with him remains one of the greatest experiences of my life.I can genuinely say I\u0027ve never loved any man more than I loved Arsène Wenger that day.By yesterday, 14 years on, that love had dissolved into a feeling of such despair I could barely look at the man.As Socrates said: \u0027The hottest love has the coldest end.\u0027And yet now, as I finally write Wenger\u0027s Arsenal obituary and remember the incredible highs I experienced under him in that first epic decade, those old feelings stir once more.Like any elongated orce, this has been a painful process for all Arsenal fans.Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to be.I particularly loathed seeing him showered with vicious personal abuse in the street from time to time by a few idiotic yobs.Contrary to popular belief, I have never hated Wenger the man I\u0027ve only hated his refusal to step down when it was obvious he should, especially when brilliant potential replacements like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola came on the market and were swooped up by Premier League rivals.But now, finally, he\u0027s done so and that allows me to pay tribute to Arsene Wenger, rather than incessantly moan about him.          Wenger pictured when he first arrived at Arsenal\u0027s then-home Highbury in 1996For eight years, he rivalled Sir Alex as the best manager in the world and based on that period alone, he was the best in Arsenal history.He\u0027s won 10 trophies in 22 years and over 1200 games.But his true legacy will be the way he transformed the way English football was played and how the players conducted themselves.Out went the beer, in came the scientific diets and fitness regimes.More importantly, Wenger drove his teams to play exhilarating one-touch, high-speed football of such exquisite skill and style that it made us the envy of the world.\u0027My never ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man,\u0027 he told L\u0027Équipe in 2016.That struggle grew harder in recent years as Wenger\u0027s powers lessened, but this is not the day to dwell on that.This is the day to look back with gratitude for the great times he gave us.Wenger\u0027s announcement hit the perfect note.\u0027I managed the club with full commitment and integrity,\u0027 he said, which is entirely true.Then he added: \u0027I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club. My love and support forever.\u0027          I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirementWhether you were Wenger Out, or Wenger In, that\u0027s a sentiment to bring a lump to the throat.I hope we now go on and win the Europa League for him.That would be the best way to send Wenger off.It won\u0027t be easy because our semi-final opponents are the very capable Atletico Madrid whose manager Diego Simeone is just the kind of youthful, ruthless, dynamic firebrand that Wenger used to be.But I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirement.The Emirates stadium will be packed for every one of the final few home games, and the roars of \u0027One Arsene Wenger\u0027 will once again be heard all over North London.That is no less than he deserves.It\u0027s time for Wenger\u0027s most ferocious critics like me to get off his back and say what we have wanted to say throughout these long, tortuous years campaigning for his exit: \u0027Goodbye, Arsene, and thank you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/4B5ABBEC00000578-5638857-image-a-26_1524233083082.jpg","title":"Owner mansion ordered chop huge trees neighbour complained kept shadows","story":"    Dr David Hamilton owns the property Isla Bank House in Keith, Moray, a 12-bedroomed property that was built around 1892 and boasts antique furnishings and extensive gardens          A prolonged row between Dr Hamilton and his neighbour Stacey Chalmers over a \u0027green wall\u0027 of western red cedar trees has seen council bosses order a large section of the 230ft long hedge be cut down Mrs Chalmers said efforts to reach an amicable settlement with her Norfolk-based neighbour had failed despite numerous attempts in the past three years.She claimed the shadow cast by the enormous trees opposite her home forced her to have her kitchen lights on all year round and starved her back garden of sunshine.She used high hedge laws in a bid to have Moray Council order to take action after claiming the attempts at negotiating an agreement had left her \u0027stressed and overwhelmed\u0027.A report issued by council planners following site visits resulted in victory for Mrs Chalmers and an order to chop the trees issued last month.Planners said: \u0027The hedge is currently between approx 45 and 52ft high and therefore results in a significant impact on the applicant\u0027s conservatory and kitchen windows and rear private garden space. Elephants on the rampage in north London: Incredible...My brand new £700,000 house stinks!

Thorny scrub — hawthorn, blackthorn, dog rose and bramble — has punched through fields that, only a few years earlier, were blanketed with maize and barleyGiving up intensive farming on our 3,500 acres had been a difficult, but unavoidable, decision on desperately poor soil — heavy clay — we rarely made a profit and had worked up an eye-watering overdraft.Inspired by a rewilding experiment in Holland, we’d sold our dairy herds and farm machinery, stepped back and allowed nature to take the driving seat — the first project of its kind in Britain.This didn’t go down well with many of our neighbours, who complained that it was an immoral waste of land, an eyesore full of weeds and brambles. And now the great thistle invasion seemed to be proving them right.A biblical gust of wind!

Was this the end of our vision to establish a patch of self-wilded nature, a messy, rambunctious, mini-wilderness in the heart of West Sussex?Just when all seemed lost, out of a clear blue sky came a very different invasion. That warm, clear Sunday morning in May 2009, we woke to see painted lady butterflies streaming past our bedroom window at the rate of one a minute.Outside, thousands upon thousands of them had descended on the swathes of creeping thistle to lay their eggs. As we approached, our dogs ran into the prickly cover, sending up puffs of orange and brown wings like autumn leaves.          The rewilding of Knepp has turned out to be far richer than we ever dreamed and is producing a wealth of information new to science, often subverting what ecologists think they know about the natural world, says Isabella Tree (pictured)We walked for half an hour that morning, parting curtains of butterflies. A few weeks later, spiky black caterpillars were swarming over the thistles, spinning silken webs like tents.The whole area took on the appearance of a chaotic army encampment.By autumn, the caterpillars had wolfed down the leaves, pupated and flown away, leaving our thistle fields in tatters. The following year, our 60 acres of creeping thistle had vanished entirely.Not only had Nature solved the thistle problem, but thanks to sitting on our hands, we’d been given a ringside seat at one of its greatest spectacles.Knepp Castle Estate is just 45 miles from Central London, though you wouldn’t know it. Thorny scrub — hawthorn, blackthorn, dog rose and bramble — has punched through fields that, only a few years earlier, were blanketed with maize and barley.          Miles of hedgerows, previously cut back every autumn — thereby depriving birds of winter berries — have exploded into the welcoming earth, billowing out like a dowager liberated from her stays.The first thing that strikes visitors is the noise: the low-level surround-sound thrumming of insects. Then the countless different bird songs: the very air, it seems, is being recolonised with the sounds of the past.We walk knee-deep through ox-eye daisies, bird’s-foot trefoil, ragged robin, knapweed, red clover, lady’s bedstraw, crested dog’s tail and sweet vernal grass, kicking up grasshoppers, hoverflies and all sorts of bumblebees.On a good July day, I can count ten species of butterfly — we have 34 altogether, including the rare purple emperor — without moving from my desk. At night, Knepp hosts an incredible 441 different species of moth.Meanwhile, more and more endangered species turn up every year — such as turtle doves, which are on the brink of extinction, and nightingales, whose numbers fell by 91 per cent between 1967 and 2007.          It took about two years for our longhorns to settle into a recognisable pattern, with an older cow as decision-maker. The herd might be lazing in the sun or holed up in warm leaf litter when suddenly she’d begin to bellow and lead them off into a brisk trotCuckoos, spotted flycatchers, fieldfares, hobbies, woodlarks, skylarks, lapwings, house sparrows, lesser spotted woodpeckers, yellowhammers, woodcock, red kites, sparrowhawks, peregrine falcons, all five types of British owl, the first ravens at Knepp in the past 100 years — the list goes on and on.The speed at which all these species — and many more — have appeared has astonished observers, particularly as our intensively farmed land was, biologically speaking, in dire condition in 2001, at the start of the project.The key to Knepp’s extraordinary success? It’s about surrendering all preconceptions, and simply observing what happens.By contrast, conventional conservation tends to be about targets and control, and often involves micro-managing a habitat for the perceived benefit of several chosen species.Originally, Charlie and I had embarked on this project — funded chiefly by conservation grants — out of an amateurish love for wildlife.

Before: The speed at which all these species — and many more — have appeared has astonished observers, particularly as our intensively farmed land was, biologically speaking, in dire condition in 2001, at the start of the projectThe rewilding of Knepp has turned out to be far richer than we ever dreamed and is producing a wealth of information new to science, often subverting what ecologists think they know about the natural world.Leave a piece of land to nature for long enough, and it will eventually become a dense wood. Every farmer knows that.In ancient times, before humans had any impact on the land, Britain was covered with closed-canopy forest. A squirrel could have run from John o’ Groats to Land’s End across the tops of trees.Or so the prevailing theory goes. But it’s wrong for several reasons. One is that grazing animals — such as wild ox, horses and bison — were here long before the trees.And if they’d had to live in dense forests, they would have quickly died off. Another is that Britain has had oak trees for millennia, and these require an open landscape. Fossils of beetles and snails, among other species, also indicate that the land was once largely wood pasture (trees dotted across fields) and thorny scrub.          In ancient times, before humans had any impact on the land, Britain was covered with closed-canopy forest. A squirrel could have run from John o’ Groats to Land’s End across the tops of treesSo what stopped the trees from taking over? There’s only one possible answer: herbivores. Unfortunately, many of the big, grazing animals that once roamed Britain — such as the wild ox, the original wild horse and the truly wild boar — are now extinct. But we have modern equivalents and we decided to introduce some of these to Knepp: red and fallow deer, Exmoor ponies, Tamworth pigs and old English longhorns.We’d chosen the longhorns because they retain enough of their wild ancestor’s genes to survive all year round outside.But how would they really behave when they were allowed to run wild? In featureless fields, our old dairy herds had simply kept their heads down chewing the cud, but without fences to contain them the longhorns could give full expression to their innate desires and preferences.They weaved among the trees, rubbing themselves against trunks and low-lying branches, raising their heads to strip off leaves and buds with their long, gluey tongues, foraged in the margins of ponds and streams, waded through the marsh.          We’d chosen the longhorns because they retain enough of their wild ancestor’s genes to survive all year round outsideThey seemed to love the sallow trees: when the flies and midges were bothersome, they’d rub their horns against the branches, smearing sap on to their faces as insect repellent.At first, not intervening, particularly when the longhorns were calving, felt entirely alien. We’d find ourselves suddenly encountering newborns lying in a ditch or hedge.Shortly after the birth, the cow would often seek out a patch of nettles to eat, presumably to replenish her levels of iron. After suckling her newborn, the new mother returns to the herd, commuting sometimes miles to her fellows and back again until her calf is strong enough to follow her.The calf’s introduction to the herd is momentous. The cattle crowd around, lowing gently, sniffing at the new arrival one by one, imprinting its aroma.While the calves are still young, one or two experienced matrons often guard them in a nursery while the herd moves on to feed. But even after a cow has more offspring, the family bond remains strong.I thought back to the agonising nights, many years before, when I’d hear bellowing calves, newly separated from their mothers.At just three days old, they’d been put into calf units, where they were fed on powdered milk from an automated machine.It took about two years for our longhorns to settle into a recognisable pattern, with an older cow as decision-maker. The herd might be lazing in the sun or holed up in warm leaf litter when suddenly she’d begin to bellow and lead them off into a brisk trot.Seeing the cattle crashing along on some unknown mission is reminiscent of the elephant march in The Jungle Book.It was also soon clear that the longhorns were creating opportunities for other species.          I thought back to the agonising nights, many years before, when I’d hear bellowing calves, newly separated from their mothersIn places where a low branch provided a scratching post, for example, the clay compacted by their hooves created saucers that periodically filled with water.These clean-water ‘ephemeral ponds’ are an important habitat for plants like water crowfoot, water starwort and stoneworts, and a whole range of snails and water beetles, as well as the endangered and ethereal fairy shrimp.The first March after the longhorns’ arrival, their former owner paid us a visit, anxious to see how they’d weathered the winter without human intervention.He couldn’t believe we hadn’t fed them. Nor had there been any need for the vet indeed, our calving and health statistics were better than on most conventional cattle farms.Browsing on twigs, bark, herbs and leaves appears to provide cows with nutrients and minerals that grass alone cannot give.          These clean-water ‘ephemeral ponds’ are an important habitat for plants like water crowfoot, water starwort and stoneworts, and a whole range of snails and water beetles, as well as the endangered and ethereal fairy shrimpIn addition, many of these have medicinal properties — indeed, the hedges of old provided livestock with a source of nutrition and self-medication.Apart from all that, longhorns produce exceptional beef. The chef Heston Blumenthal rates it above all other types, including Japanese Kobe, as the best-tasting steak in the world.We started culling when our herd had expanded to 283 head — more than the land could happily sustain. Suddenly, a by-product of rewilding became a significant income stream. We were, in effect, producing premium organic beef with no feed and few other costs — and there are now waiting lists for our prime cuts.Six Exmoor ponies arrived months after the cattle, in 2003.As they galloped from the trailer, bucking their way back to freedom, we could see we were dealing with an animal way wilder than the longhorn.          A native species red deer, pictured, was introduced to the project in West SussexThere’s little doubt about their credentials as an ancient breed: fossil remains dating back to around 50,000BC have been found round Exmoor. Now an endangered species, they’re rarer than tigers.A year later, we introduced two Tamworth sows and their eight piglets. Prohibited by law from keeping wild boar, we’d opted for this old breed to stand in as their proxy — rootling and disturbing the soil as their ancestors had on our land in the time of King John.The Exmoors acted as if we’d introduced them to a pack of grizzly bears.One glimpse of the vast, bristly, ginger farmyard sows, and the ponies were running for the hills. Perhaps they had some atavistic memory of wild boar predating on newborn foals.The pigs had an extraordinary impact. The instant they were let out, they destroyed Charlie’s manicured verges along the drives with the unstoppable momentum of forklift trucks.Then, two abreast, they unzipped the turf down the public footpaths.          A year later, we introduced two Tamworth sows and their eight piglets. Prohibited by law from keeping wild boar, we’d opted for this old breed to stand in as their proxy — rootling and disturbing the soil as their ancestors had on our land in the time of King JohnWe realised they were zeroing in on slivers of the land never ploughed — margins rich in invertebrates and rhizomes.Their ingenuity often got the better of us when it came to public events in our park.Though we electric-fenced a showground for a summer Craft Fair, we didn’t think to fortify the pond on one side of it.The pigs swam over in the middle of the night, broke into the confectionery tent and hoovered down two sacks of Mr Whippy powdered ice cream.At first, we were dismayed to observe their capacity for damage, particularly in the wet, when ten pigs could churn acres into the battlefield of the Somme in a matter of hours. But the land’s ability to regenerate was equally astonishing.Within days, a patchwork of pioneer plants would appear where the sward had been opened. Invertebrates, including rare bees, colonised the exposed ground.          To many of our neighbours, the most offensive aspect of Knepp, epitomising our neglectful ways, is the appearance of ‘injurious’ weeds. By far the worst, in their view, is common ragwort. Standing around 3ft tall, it produces dense, flat-topped clusters of bright yellow flowers, and is thought to be a killer of livestockIn winter, wrens, dunnocks and robins trailed in the wake of the Tamworths, picking for insects in the furrows.Ants used clods of earth turned over by the pigs to kick-start anthills that have grown, in some places, over a foot in eight years.Anthills, in turn, attracted mistle thrushes and wheatears — and especially green woodpeckers, whose diet consists of as much as 80 per cent grassland ants.To many of our neighbours, the most offensive aspect of Knepp, epitomising our neglectful ways, is the appearance of ‘injurious’ weeds. By far the worst, in their view, is common ragwort. Standing around 3ft tall, it produces dense, flat-topped clusters of bright yellow flowers, and is thought to be a killer of livestock.And it does, indeed, contain toxins that, when eaten in large quantities, cause liver failure and death.But grazing animals have lived with it for tens of thousands of years.Our longhorns, Exmoors and Tamworths, as well as roe and red deer, graze among ragwort with no adverse effects.          Contrary to what naturalists had assumed, a nightingale is not a woodland bird after all. Neither are purple emperors — one of our most spectacular butterflies — a woodland species, as previously thought: ours nest in young sallow scrubThey know to avoid it. In fact, the plant itself warns them away with its bitter taste and unpleasant smell.Poisoning arises not in the wild, of course, but where fields and paddocks are over-grazed and the animals have no choice but to eat it — or when ragwort is cut into silage or hay and animals are unable to detect and avoid it.Even then, the animal has to eat an excessive amount for it to be fatal, yet few people nowadays are able to accept common ragwort’s place in nature.To put it in context, there are plenty of other common plants that can kill, including foxglove, cuckoo pint, ivy, black bryony, white bryony, bracken, elder, spindle, and yew — as well as daffodils, one of our most poisonous plants.A few years ago, daffodils almost killed a vicar, after he ate a bunch to enliven his Easter sermon. He had to be rushed to hospital to have his stomach pumped. Yet no one thinks to denigrate these lovely flowers.As for ragwort, it’s one of the most sustaining hosts to insects that we have in Britain: in all, 177 species of insects use it as a source of nectar or pollen.The nightingales arrived in such numbers that we began to have nightingale dinners, taking friends out at night to listen to their astonishing arias. Most had never heard one before.Conservationists began taking an interest when it emerged that the nightingales nested deep in the exploding skirts of an overgrown hedge, fringed with brambles, nettles and long grasses.Contrary to what naturalists had assumed, a nightingale is not a woodland bird after all. Neither are purple emperors — one of our most spectacular butterflies — a woodland species, as previously thought: ours nest in young sallow scrub.Even more exciting even than the nightingales was the arrival of turtle doves, with their throaty turr-turr-ing.There are estimated to be fewer than 5,000 pairs left in the whole of Britain. The RSPB describes them as feeding on seeds and nothing else. In fact, in the increasing absence of weeds in the countryside, grains may be their food of last resort.          Cuckoos, spotted flycatchers, fieldfares, hobbies, woodlarks, skylarks, lapwings, house sparrows, lesser spotted woodpeckers, yellowhammers, woodcock, red kites, sparrowhawks, peregrine falcons, all five types of British owl, the first ravens at Knepp in the past 100 years — the list goes on and onWhole grains are indigestible and the sharp edges of cracked grains can tear their throats. Grains can also absorb moisture in the gut and generate fungal disease.We don’t yet know exactly what our turtle doves are eating, but we do know that they’re finding it at Knepp.The pigs may yet again be playing a role: their rootling produces exactly the right conditions for the germination of seed-bearing wildflowers that attract these rare birds.One thing is for certain. If we hadn’t allowed a dynamic ecosystem to establish itself here, we’d never have had turtle doves — or any other endangered species — in the first place.And if all these natural miracles can happen here, on our depleted patch of land in the over-developed, densely populated South-East, they can happen anywhere.Adapted from Wilding: The Return Of Nature To A British Farm by Isabella Tree, published by Picador on May 3 at £20.

He did so only after much soul-searching and believes that if he hadn’t let go of his hatred, ‘I wouldn’t be here talking to you now’.Neville has long been regarded as a man of few words, but with forgiveness has come liberation. Today, the feelings he had kept locked deep inside for so many years come tumbling out.This is the first time he has spoken with such raw honesty about his personal struggles.‘I was so angry — even in my sleep, I’d be thinking bad thoughts. Gradually, I’ve let those thoughts go. I’ve got to the stage now where I don’t even remember the names of the guys who killed him. They used to be here.’ He taps his forehead. ‘Slowly, the anger is going away.’          Earlier this week, Neville Lawrence made a pilgrimage of sorts to the bus stop where his 18-year-old son, Stephen, was fatally stabbed 25 years agoToday, Neville, 76, looks a decade younger than the beleaguered man who stood on the Old Bailey steps when two of his son’s murderers, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, were sentenced to life imprisonment six years ago.Those convictions, the first since Stephen’s death, might well have been a victory for justice, but they didn’t ease Neville’s suffering. Nor the suffering of Stephen’s mother, Baroness Lawrence, who, in an emotional interview with this newspaper earlier this month, confessed she hasn’t known true happiness since her son’s death, and spoke of her desire to ‘draw a line’ under her tireless campaigning for Stephen.She also urged police, in the absence of significant leads, to close the investigation.Neville disagrees. ‘After the verdict, I went to my son’s grave in Jamaica. I know a lot of people would say you’re mad talking to somebody who’s dead, but I talk to him. I said: “We’ve got two of them, I don’t know if we’re going to get any more, but we have that satisfaction for the time being.” ’He falls silent and, for a moment, he is thousands of miles away, at the peaceful plot in Jamaica where his son lies buried in the shade of coconut and ackee trees. ‘Knowing my son’s lying there in the ground, sometimes I just go to pieces.‘Even now when I start talking about it, my eyes fill up because I know what kind of person he was — what kind of person he would have been.  For many years, Neville could not even bring himself to drive along the road in South-East London where his desperately wounded son ran for some 350 yards before he fell‘We had some justice, but I’m still hoping for total justice, which is why I don’t want them to close the case. I want them to scale the investigation down, but not close it.‘With all the publicity there is at the moment, someone might decide to come forward and say something they haven’t before.’This week, Stephen’s death has dominated the media.To mark the 25th anniversary, a gripping three-part BBC documentary, Stephen: The Murder That Changed A Nation, examined in forensic detail the senseless murder and the fight for justice, passionately championed by the Daily Mail, which led to the exposure of institutional racism running deep in the Metropolitan Police. The repercussions continue to reverberate throughout every level of society to this day.On Monday, leading dignitaries, including Prince Harry and Prime Minister Theresa May, will gather at a memorial service in London, organised by Baroness Lawrence, to remember Stephen and celebrate all that has been achieved in his name.Until three days ago, Neville thought he wouldn’t be there. He had not been invited, until Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick intervened. Neville does not dwell upon the reasons why he wasn’t on the guest list. He simply says: ‘I wanted to go. It’s my son, but I wasn’t the one arranging it, so what could I do?‘On Wednesday evening, the police commissioner phoned. She said she hadn’t seen an invitation for me, so now I’m going.’The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. In her interview with the Mail two weeks ago, Stephen’s mother said: ‘Neville and I were two different people after that night. They say a tragedy like that either pushes you together or pulls you apart. The latter is exactly what happened.    The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. Pictured: Doreen and Neville Lawrence at the first murder trial ‘In a way, I felt she was blaming me for Stephen’s death. Whether that was right or wrong, I don’t know, but that’s what I was feeling inside.‘Doreen was away on a field trip for her degree when Stephen was murdered. I was supposed to be looking after the children. If something happens to your child when one of you is away, straight away you start thinking: “If I’d been here, maybe it wouldn’t have happened.”‘She hasn’t said she blames me, but I think she does. I know I was blaming myself.’Neville, a talented plasterer and decorator, had been looking after the children for two days when Stephen left for school that day. By nature a warm, jovial man, his spirits had been worn down by a lack of work during the recession.The marriage was, he concedes, going through a difficult patch, but he believed the overriding love they had for their children would help them to weather it.‘I thought I wouldn’t have any children because it took so long to find someone I wanted to marry,’ says Neville. ‘I’d made this promise to myself I would not have a child out of wedlock. I wanted to be married to somebody, so my children could grow up in my house and I could have influence over them.‘Stephen was my first-born child. I was there when he arrived. When he came out of hospital, I was worried all night because there were a lot of cot deaths about at the time. I kept getting up to listen to him breathing.’          A memorial plaque now marks the place with the words: ‘In memory of Stephen Lawrence 13.9.1974 to 22.4.1993. May he Rest in Peace\u0027Neville was a hands-on father who changed nappies and fed his son. He still has the first pair of baby shoes Stephen wore. ‘When he left that day, I was sitting at the window feeling really low about the fact I wasn’t working to support my family.‘He said: “Dad, are you OK?” I said: “Yes I’m fine.” He said: “Are you sure?” I said: “Yes, and remember your mummy’s coming back tonight. I’m going to do dinner, so come straight home from school.” ’But Stephen didn’t come home.Instead, two neighbours knocked on the door to tell Doreen, by now home, and Neville, that Stephen had been attacked. They called police stations and searched the streets. Finding no sign of their son, they went to a nearby hospital and learned he had been admitted.‘When we got to the hospital, I asked where Stephen was. The doctor said: “We’re working on him.” They showed us to a waiting room. When I saw a nurse and doctor walking down the corridor, I’m thinking: “Please, God, let them tell me he’s going to be OK.” They told us he was dead.‘After touching my son on that hospital slab, I can remember nothing else.’Neville’s next memory is waking up the following morning. He thought his son’s death was a bad dream.‘The first thing I did was go to Stephen’s bedroom to see if his bed had been slept in. When I saw it hadn’t, I knew that what I’d remembered was true.‘For a few days, I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t even remember my full name. I was walking around kind of stunted in a way.‘It affected me so much. I was never the Neville who was here before Stephen was murdered. I was different.’          David Norris (left) and Gary Dobson were convicted of Stephen\u0027s murder six years ago    Luke Knight, 41, showed little remorse when confronted ahead of the 25th anniversaryBefore a reporter could question him, the roofer, wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt, shouted: ‘Oh, f*** off, mate,’ before slamming his door.His outburst came after the BBC broadcast the first of its three-part series on Britain’s most notorious race murder. Earlier, Knight had his trademark swagger as he walked down the street near where he and his cohorts once terrorised locals.In February 1997, the Mail accused Knight’s gang of murdering 18-year-old Stephen in a savage, unprovoked attack as he waited with a friend at a bus-stop on April 22, 1993.Two of the gang, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, are serving life for the killing, after a forensic breakthrough led to a second murder trial six years ago. A third, Neil Acourt, 42, is in jail for masterminding a £4 million cannabis ring.

Sense of history preferred. No salary.Sound familiar?Little wonder that the clunkingly obvious person for the job was formally endorsed as the next Head of the Commonwealth yesterday.It had been the Queen’s ‘sincere wish’ that the Prince of Wales should be acknowledged as her chosen successor to this non-hereditary role.So last night’s news, confirmed in the leaders’ statement at the close of the Commonwealth summit, will have come as an early present ahead of today’s celebrations for the Queen’s 92nd birthday.Yesterday, she was doing what she has enjoyed doing for the best part of seven decades as she surrounded herself with the leaders of the 53 Commonwealth nations. She invited them for drinks during their informal ‘retreat’ – the traditional finale of these summits – at Windsor Castle.She stayed well away from all the networking going on in the state apartments, where the politicians were berthed. Later, they were invited to her side of the castle for refreshments. The Prince of Wales, quite properly, was miles away.He will no doubt be pleased that this delicate succession issue has been resolved now, at a time of the Queen’s choosing rather than the Almighty’s.          The Prince of Wales greets the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting          Anita Sethi (right of photo, with glasses on her head) meeting Prince Charles at the Commonwealth People\u0027s Forum in LondonThere has been no change to the process, however, and the Royal Family have not sought one. They understand that the headship must be earned, and not simply inherited. The Duke of Cambridge is well aware of that.The only grudging footnote to Charles’s appointment as head-in-waiting was a bizarre claim in yesterday’s Guardian. A writer called Anita Sethi has written that she met the prince at this week’s Commonwealth People’s Forum.Ooops! The new Head of Commonwealth-elect Prince Charles...When can you start? Prince Charles to begin new role as Head...Share this articleAccording to her account, he deployed that trusty conversation-starter ‘And where are you from?’ – to which she replied: ‘Manchester’.She then says the prince joked: ‘Well, you don’t look like it!’ As a result, Miss Sethi, who is of Guyanese heritage, now argues that the prince is unfit to lead the Commonwealth.          Ms Sethi says Prince Charles told her \u0027you don\u0027t look like you\u0027re from Manchester\u0027             She then says the prince joked: ‘Well, you don’t look like it!’            I am intrigued by this exchange for many reasons – not least the fact that I, too, happened to be at this event. I certainly can’t claim to have heard everything the prince said, but I heard a fair bit and I didn’t hear him say this.The occasion, frankly, was a bunfight because so many people were jostling to meet him. He was doing the rounds of a London conference centre where thousands of delegates were attending four different forums.When he walked in to a buffet lunch for the Business Forum delegates, a band of drummers made so much noise that it was impossible to hear the prince say anything. It wasn’t very different two floors up at the People’s Forum where Miss Sethi was in the melee.The scrum got so bad that one veteran royal photographer simply gave up trying to take a picture and helped himself to a plate of curry. The organisers had tried to line up pre-arranged groups for royal introductions, but it turned in to a free-for-all.          Ms Sethi says she was \u0027stunned\u0027 by the prince\u0027s gaffe and she could \u0027show him her passport to prove where she was born\u0027In the midst of this good-natured shambles, Miss Sethi tried to draw the prince’s attention to her latest book – it was then the alleged exchange took place. Clarence House has opted for dignified silence. I can only say that the Sethi version of events bears no relation to the man I have seen in these situations over more than 25 years. The prince has always seen it as his role to act as a bridge between races and cultures, and has done so for longer than perhaps any politician or ‘community leader’ in Britain.Take his thoughts on the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants. ‘Thank you for coming and for your contributions to this country,’ he said to hundreds of families at a special Windrush party he organised at St James’s Palace.          Prince Charles greets Canadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauThis wasn’t the other day. It happened in 1998, two decades before those buffoons at the Home Office learned about the legacy of the Windrush.That same year, I followed him on tours of Sri Lanka and Nepal where he met thousands of people just like those he has been doing this week. No gaffes.Two years later, I followed him to the Caribbean. We ended up in Guyana, the country where members of Miss Sethi’s family were once indentured workers. There were many engagements in run-down areas of the capital, Georgetown. The prince met the most deprived members of society and went to see a local version of his Youth Business Trust. No gaffes. Ditto in South Africa, Lesotho, Jamaica, Malaysia, Singapore and Trinidad – all Commonwealth countries where I have been glued to the poor man’s every move.So is Charles, as he nears his 70th birthday, suddenly starting to lose the plot? I don’t think so. Having toured the Commonwealth since the age of five, he is manifestly suited to step in to the Queen’s oceanic Commonwealth shoes when the time comes. He must be the only person (except the Queen) who can identify all of the flags fluttering along the Mall this week.This is an organisation which cannot open its mouth without banging on about the fact that 60 per cent of its people are under 30. And guess who established the biggest youth charity network in Britain? This week, the Prince’s Trust International, its global arm, was round for tea at Clarence House.In fact, what is perhaps most striking about his appointment is the lack of controversy. When the EU, UN, Fifa or pretty much any other world body seeks a new head, there is usually a fratricidal dogfight. Here is an organisation ning 2.4billion people which has just had a selection process devoid of any rancour at all – with the possible exception of Jeremy Corbyn and Miss Sethi. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/03/4B5FF6FB00000578-5640333-image-a-52_1524279227631.jpg","title":"Single mother held watched Missouri home burn four children inside","story":"This photo provided by KYTV in Springfield, Missouri, shows the aftermath of a fire that killed the four Otto siblings in Lake Ozark on Thursday morning           The home, pictured above after the fire, was left in shambles, with holes in its roof and its walls burned entirely to the ground          Another view of the home reveals the severe damage to the side panels and walls           Mother Tina Brazil pictured above with her four children in an image from May 2017          Brazil\u0027s four sons died in the blaze, pictured above victims (from left to right) Levi Otto, four, Carson Otto, eight, Tyler Otto, 14, and Max Otto, five          The boys were home alone when the fire blazed. 14-year-old Tyler Otto (pictured riding an ATV) 8-year-old Carson Otto 5-year-old Max Otto and 4-year-old Levi Otto (pictured together in the wagon)\u0027My children!

W. Bush sits by Barbara\u0027s...Avicii dead at 28: Wake Me Up DJ Tim Bergling dies in Oman...Share this articleKAYAKS MADE FROM FISHING NETSIn January this year, the first kayak made from recycled fishing nets came off the production line.It was created by amateur er Rob Thompson, who was desperate to find a use for all the abandoned nets, crab pots and fisherman’s rope he came across while exploring underwater.An estimated 600,000 tons of damaged or dumped plastic netting has built up in the oceans, where it traps and strangles sea life.He dreamed up a plan to turn the nets into kayaks, which beach-cleaning crews could then use to access remote stretches of coastline — and clear them of even more toxic plastic trash.He tracked down a recycling plant in Denmark that would accept old nets and convert them into recycled plastic pellets.Then, working with a kayak company called Palm Equipment, based near Bristol, he found a way to turn the pellets made from nets into a kayak by mixing the pellets with recylced marine plastic collected from beach clear-ups.Now Rob has teamed up with Keep Britain Tidy, organising volunteer ers and beach-cleaning groups from around the UK to gather fishing nets and ship them off to Denmark in bulk, rather than seeing them dumped in landfill.‘The first batch has produced 150kg of recycled plastic pellets, which is enough for six kayaks,’ says Rob.The prototypes are being used by beach clean-up volunteers, but the next batch will be sold (for around £370 each) and the proceeds will help rid Britain’s waters of yet more plastic (fathomsfree.org).SHAMPOO BOTTLES FROM BEACH WASTEThe sight of plastic food and drink packaging littering British beaches is a sickening reminder of the work that still needs to be done.But volunteer beach clean-up crews — many of whom will be taking part in our Great Plastic Pick Up weekend — have the option to put plastic that has been dumped or washed up on beaches into special bins funded by Procter \u0026amp Gamble.The company will then use this ‘ocean plastic’ — traditionally considered very difficult to recycle, as it is often degraded after spending time in the water — into new bottles of Head \u0026amp Shoulders shampoo and Fairy Liquid.  There’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid OceanThere’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid Ocean. The rest of the bottle is made of other recycled plastics.The process has been made possible by recycling company TerraCycle, which provides the bins and sorts the plastic. Its spokesman Stephen Clarke says: ‘Plastic coming from the marine environment is notoriously difficult to re-use, but we have found a technically revolutionary way of integrating 25 per cent of this plastic into the product.’DECKING FROM MILK BOTTLE TOPSImagine being able to wander into your garden to enjoy a morning coffee on your stylish decking, confident that it hasn’t started to rot over the winter, there’s no mildew to scrub off and no splinters — plus the satisfaction of knowing it’s also great for the environment.In recent years, the single biggest use of low-grade recycled plastic in the UK (such as bottle tops, yoghurt pots and bleach bottles) has been the manufacture of ‘plastic wood’ — plastic planks moulded to look like wood which are then used to build outdoor furniture and play equipment.The problem is most types look much more like unsightly plastic than timber.  Composite Prime has melted down recycled plastic and mixed it with unwanted off-cuts of hardwood, ground down to a fine flour, to create durable, low-maintenance decking which looks just like the real thingBut a company called Composite Prime has melted down recycled plastic and mixed it with unwanted off-cuts of hardwood, ground down to a fine flour, to create durable, low-maintenance decking which looks just like the real thing.Each plank has roughly 35 per cent plastic from discarded milk bottles and their tops.‘We saved over 9.5million milk bottles from landfill last year,’ says Charles Taylor, a director of the company.A KITCHEN FROM COLA BOTTLES . . .That plastic bottle you toss into the recycling bin could one day return as part of your kitchen cabinet door.Ikea’s new Kungsbacka range of kitchen fronts is made from recycled wood coated in a thin plastic foil made from recycled bottles, with 25 half-litre bottles used for each door.Darryl Pirie, of Ikea kitchens, says: ‘The range turns everyday waste into beautiful furniture.’Ikea also makes storage boxes (£3 to £12) from recycled plastic bottles, spray bottles (80p) from waste plastic collected from the store and its distribution centres, and a desk pad (£4.50) made with 50 per cent recycled plastic from Ikea packaging.. . . AND A MATTRESSYou could soon be dozing off on a soft mattress made from plastic bottles collected during the Great Plastic Pick Up. Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattresses (£489 for a double, silentnight.co.uk).The mattress, launched last year, is made from plastic bottles that are crushed and spun into a fine, soft fibre. This is then used to form a special breathable layer that makes sleeping on it a cooler, more comfortable experience.In one year alone, Silentnight claims to have prevented 105 million plastic bottles from entering landfill or the sea.          Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattressesROADS MADE OF PLASTIC PELLETSYou could be driving to work over a recycled plastic road.Toby McCartney, founder of road surfacing company MacRebur, came up with the idea after a trip to India. He saw locals collect waste plastic from rubbish dumps, pile it up over potholes in the road, pour petrol over it and set it alight. ‘I watched with fascination as the melted plastic moulded to fit the shape of the hole, effectively filling it for free,’ he says.Now Toby takes plastic waste from local authority recycling plants across the country — ‘It’s the waste plastic no one really wants and which would normally be incinerated or go to landfill,’ he says — then melts it into pellets, which are added to an ordinary road surface mix to supplement the bitumen.‘Our roads are up to 60 per cent stronger and ten times longer lasting — and they don’t pothole,’ he says proudly.COFFEE CUPS FROM . . . COFFEE CUPS!They might look like they’re made from paper, but most takeaway coffee cups are lined with a thin layer of plastic. It stops your coffee from leaking out, but also makes them notoriously difficult to recycle.Now a UK company called ashortwalk, based in Cornwall, has designed the rCup, made from discarded coffee cups.Managing director Dan Dicker explains that the company gathers takeaway cups from outlets such as McDonald’s and Costa. They are then washed, shredded, and mixed 5050 with recycled plastic from coffee cup lids and straws.The rCup is leakproof, insulated, lasts ten years and is fully recyclable (£12 from www.rcup.co.uk, Waitrose and John Lewis).          Now a UK company called ashortwalk, based in Cornwall, has designed the rCup, made from discarded coffee cupsTRAINERS FROM OCEAN PLASTICYour new trainers could once have been a discarded fishing net floating in the Males.Adidas has teamed up with a company called Parley for the Oceans, which organises coastal clean-ups in the remote island chain.The fishing nets and plastic they gather are turned into sports shoes.The upper is 95 per cent recycled ocean plastic that is melted down and spun into a technical yarn fibre called Econyl that behaves exactly like nylon. The rest of the shoe is made from recycled polyester.Marine waste is also used in the laces, heel webbing, heel lining and sock liner covers, adding up to the equivalent of 11 plastic bottles per pair.The Adidas x Parley sports shoes range starts at £69.95.          Marine waste is also used in the laces, heel webbing, heel lining and sock liner covers, adding up to the equivalent of 11 plastic bottles per pair.NEW JUMPERS FROM RAGSOutdoor clothing brand Patagonia was creating fleeces from plastic bottles as far back as 1993.Today it turns plastic bottles, difficult-to-recycle manufacturing waste and worn-out garments into thin polyester fibers, which are then used to produce clothing such as the Snap-T fleece pullover (from £80, eu.patagonia.com) which is made from 85 per cent recycled polyester.‘By recycling old products, we can keep many of the same materials in circulation for years instead of creating new plastic,’ says a spokesperson.SHADES FROM TRAWLER WASTE In 2013, a group of U.S. surfers and environmentalists formed a firm called Bureo to help fishermen in Chile discard their old fishing nets responsibly rather than dumping them at sea.The nets are recycled to create decks for skateboards (around £200, carverskateboards.co.uk) and the frames for high-fashion sunglasses.  The Mail\u0027s great plastic pick up  The Mail is stepping up its war on plastic with The Great Plastic Pick Up — a weekend helping communities, schools, families and iniduals come together to clear plastic litter from our beaches, beauty spots and streets, in partnership with Keep Britain Tidy.A staggering 7,330 people have already signed up, and there are 315 Pick Ups being held countrywide.It’s so simple to join in and you can win amazing prizes that may make all the difference to your community.

We hope this indicates an effort to negotiate in good faith.\u0027We remain committed to working with our international partners to bring about our goal of a complete, verifiable and irreversible de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and to do so through peaceful means.\u0027The US-North Korea meeting is scheduled for May or June, although no location has been decided plans are continuing apace, with CIA director Mike Pompeo flying to Pyongyang for talks with Kim over the Easter weekend.South Korean President Moon Jae-in is also due to meet the dictator on April 27 at a border truce village for a rare summit focused on nuclear issues.President Trump heralded Friday\u0027s announcement, tweeting: \u0027North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.\u0027He later added: \u0027A message from Kim Jong Un: \u0027North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u0027 Also will \u0027Shut down a nuclear test site in the country\u0027s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.\u0027 Progress being made for all!\u0027 South Korea also welcomed the decision, saying it represented \u0027meaningful progress for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\u0027.But Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said he was not satisfied with the announcement, and demanded pressure be kept up on North Korea until it abandons its missile programme in a complete, irreversible and verifiable way. The decision was made in a meeting of the ruling party\u0027s full Central Committee which had convened to discuss a \u0027new stage\u0027 of policies.  Secret footage of Kim Jong-un\u0027s \u0027slaves\u0027: North Koreans...Kremlin says Trump offered to visit RUSSIA in exchange for...North and South Korea open a telephone hotline between...Share this article    Kim speaking at the Seventh Central Committee of the Workers\u0027 Party of Korea on Friday in an image released by the official Korean Central News Agency  Pyongyang has made rapid technological progress in its weapons programmes under Kim, which has seen it subjected to increasingly strict sanctions by the UN Security Council, US, EU, South Korea and others.  Pictured: A missile launch in North Korean last yearFriday\u0027s move comes after months of threats and counter-threats between President Trump and Kim. At his New Year speech, the dictator claimed to have a nuclear button on his desk, prompting Trump to tweet that he had an even bigger one. Events have moved rapidly since then, catalyzed by the Winter Olympics in the South, and Seoul is now pushing for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, raising hopes that a settlement could finally be reached on the peninsula.But there is a long way to go and Moon himself acknowledged this week that the \u0027devil is in the details\u0027. On Thursday, the South\u0027s president revealed that Kim had expressed his commitment to \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 of the Korean peninsula without seeking conditions.          South Korean President Moon Jae-in (right, on April 18) will hold a summit with Kim in a border truce village on April 27          Pyongyang toned down its rhetoric after Kim announced in his New Year\u0027s address his plan to improve relations with Seoul and send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February. Images of these North Korean cheerleaders during the Olympics were seen around the worldMoon said the North was only seeking an end to \u0027hostile policies\u0027 against it and a guarantee of security in return.\u0027I don\u0027t think denuclearization has different meanings for South and North Korea,\u0027 he said. \u0027The North is expressing a will for a complete denuclearization.\u0027All they are talking about is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security.\u0027 The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.          On Thursday, President Trump told a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that his campaign of \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 on North Korea would continue until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weaponsIn a further development on Wednesday, Seoul said it hopes to use the up-coming summit  to change a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a peace agreement. China, Kim\u0027s main ally, immediately announced it backed the move.Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Moon said he saw the possibility of a peace agreement, or even international aid for the North\u0027s economy, if it denuclearizes.But he also said the inter-Korean summit had \u0027a lot of constraints\u0027, in that the two Koreas could not make progress separate from the North Korea-United States summit, and could not reach an agreement that transcends international sanctions.\u0027So first, the South-North Korean summit must make a good beginning, and the dialogue between the two Koreas likely must continue after we see the results of the North Korea-United States summit,\u0027 Moon said.  South Korean army soldiers pass by a wire fence decorated with ribbons written with messages wishing for the reunification of the two Koreas at the Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, South Korea, on April 20.

But these people are not obsessed with making their own food all of the time.‘This shift from preparing our own food to watching people prepare food as a form of entertainment is concerning for several reasons, not the least of which is that we are passing over the responsibility of what goes into our mouths – what nurtures us and keeps us healthy – to others.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/08/4B35FC7700000578-0-image-a-9_1523950226092.jpg","title":"British nation vote polar bear cub born UK 25 years","story":"    The nation will pick between a choice of four names - Artor, Hamish, MacKinnon and Poulsen - to call the first polar bear born in the UK for 25 years (pictured)Oh boy!

He is pictured a company after party in Beverly Hills, California on January 8, 2017Harvey Weinstein\u0027s laywers have called on the film studio he used to co-own with his brother to hand over a stash of his work emails, claiming they could help clear his name.In a filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, an attorney acting for the disgraced movie mogul said the Weinstein Company has refused to allow him access to e-mails that were relevant to ongoing criminal and civil lawsuits.The 66-year-old was fired by the company after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek accused him of offences including sexual assault and rape. The film studio filed for bankruptcy in March amid the scandal.Weinstein is the target of federal and state criminal investigations in at least four different jurisdictions, including New York, Los Angeles, and London, which have requested documentation relating to their cases, according to the filing.He is also the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble. Weinstein denies all claims of non-consensual sex. According to his attorney, Scott D. Cousins: \u0027It is critical that Mr. Weinstein be granted access to e-mails relevant to the certain civil proceedings and criminal investigations and that are in the Debtors\u0027 possession, as they were sent or received by his TWC e-mail accounts.

This was the row of seats where the window was shattered. Jennifer Riordan was sitting in the window and was partially sucked out before passengers were able to drag her back in          Passenger Marty Martinez shared photographs and videos of himself on Facebook as the plane made its descent. He and other passengers are shown terrified as they hold their oxygen masks to their faces. He later said there was \u0027blood everywhere\u0027 as a result of the woman\u0027s injuries \u0027The unsafe condition,\u0027 the FAA said in the order, \u0027is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.\u0027The inspections ordered are a sharp step-up from actions by both the European and U.S. regulators after a Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. The European agency had given airlines nine months to check engines, while U.S. regulators still were considering what to do.Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required in the next 20 days, the agencies said on Friday. A cycle includes one take-off and landing.  Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two from Albuquerque, died. Southwest Airlines would not reveal on Friday if it had offered her family anything in the form of compensation That order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the United States, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday\u0027s Southwest flight would have been affected, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.The coordinated 20-day measure partially resolves a gap in previous responses to the 2016 accident by the world\u0027s two largest and most influential aviation regulators, a person familiar with the discussions said and published documents show.The FAA in August 2017 drafted an order giving airline up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalized the measure by the time of Tuesday\u0027s fatal second accident.The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, matching the FAA\u0027s roll-out, saying data did not justify that.The ergence marked a rare difference of approach between the two agencies, especially on one of the world\u0027s most-used aviation products. CFM, which is jointly owned by General Electric Co and France\u0027s Safran, produces the CFM56 engine in factories based both in the United States and in Europe.\u0027It happens that there are disagreements about the right way to go in some cases, and this was one of them,\u0027 the person familiar with the discussions said.On Tuesday, however, when news broke that a second failure had taken place involving the same model engine, aircraft and airline - this time killing a passenger who was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat - the two agencies agreed to act quickly, the person said.          Riordan\u0027s window was smashed by shrapnel from the exploding engine several rows in front of herAn FAA spokesman said the agency disputed that it had not agreed with European regulators on the response to the engine issue. An EASA spokesman declined to comment.On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of U.S. aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.The FAA and NTSB have different roles. Investigators study the probable cause of single accidents and recommend possible changes to safety rules, while regulators have to assess whether safety risks could appear.Several major airline officials said the order will primarily impact airlines with higher utilization of aircraft covering shorter routes like Southwest.The airline\u0027s CEO Gary Kelly sent a letter to the 142 passengers who survived, apologizing for the \u0027circumstances\u0027 which surrounded the flight and offering their help reuniting them with luggage.No blame has been assigned to the airline for the engine explosion which sent a piece of shrapnel flying through the window next to Riordan.Investigators are still probing what caused the explosion and the plane had been tested for safety just three days before the catastrophe. In its letter, Southwest Airlines pointed to the ongoing National Transport Safety Board investigation into the incident but said its priority was assisting the traumatized survivors. Southwest Airlines is giving passengers on board the disastrous flight $5,000 each and a $1,000 travel voucher. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/13/4B634E5300000578-5641233-image-a-53_1524313335265.jpg","title":"Britain enjoy 80F weekend temperatures set plummet 20 DEGREES Monday","story":"    Do Wookiees tan?

with four different families over the course of two days and had to stay in a room with the hotel\u0027s children entertainer when the couple were arrested. She told MailOnline she \u0027hasn\u0027t stopped thinking about their little faces\u0027 since she flew home on Thursday.Mrs Wignall said: \u0027When I left the hotel to go to the airport I couldn\u0027t stop crying.\u0027I could cry now just thinking about how I had to walk away from those children knowing anyone could have picked them up.\u0027It could\u0027ve been another Maddie McCann story, they didn\u0027t know how much danger they were in.\u0027It\u0027s absolutely disgusting, they don\u0027t deserve to have children, let alone take them abroad.\u0027           Amanda Wignall (pictured), 37, was staying at the same resort with her husband and four-year-old son when she spotted the two girls dancing on their own and became extremely concernedThree-year-old Madeleine McCann disappeared from her hotel room in the Algarve in Portugal in May 2007 and has never been seen since. A child protection meeting is due to take place where the girls live in Scotland on Monday, where the 11-year-old girl\u0027s father is reportedly trying to get custody of her.Mrs Wignall claims she has been in contact with the girl\u0027s father to confirm they got home safely. She says she first spotted the youngsters at the hotel\u0027s children disco on Tuesday evening after flying out with her family on Sunday.She claims the 11-year-old told her \u0027in no uncertain terms\u0027 it wasn\u0027t the first time her mother and step-father, believed to be in their late 40s or early 50s, had abandoned them on holiday.She said: \u0027The eldest told me they\u0027d been on holiday before and the step-dad and her mum had gone out drinking and left them on their own.\u0027All that little girl did the whole holiday was look after her little sister. Neither of them would\u0027ve eaten anything if it wasn\u0027t for her.\u0027Mrs Wignall bumped into a friend of hers called Kate on the first day of the holiday and after spending time with her, realised she had been looking after the girls as well.The women claim they would look after the girls whenever they saw them around the hotel but they were often left with other families while their parents were out on the strip or at the bar.          Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees took to Facebook to share the \u0027shocking\u0027 story She told MailOnline: \u0027The first time I saw them I felt very uncomfortable.\u0027One night we saw them on their own and when we eventually found the mum she was absolutely paralytic. \u0027She was so drunk she couldn\u0027t even lift her head up to speak to us, let alone string a sentence together.\u0027I don\u0027t know where the step-dad was. The eldest kept saying she had to ring her dad in Scotland, we didn\u0027t know what was going on.\u0027On the final night of her stay Mrs Wignall saw the girls again and asked who would be looking after them when her and her friend had gone.She claims they told her a young couple from Wigan had agreed to take care of them while their parents went out.But when she came to check out in the early hours of Thursday reception staff told her the girls had been taken off the couple because they were also too drunk and their parents had been arrested.She said: \u0027When I left on Thursday I told the receptionist I had serious concerns about two young children staying in the hotel.           Mrs Wignall said the children \u0027could have ended up like Maddie McCann (pictured), who disappeared from her family\u0027s hotel room in Portugal in 2007 \u0027They said the father had been arrested and the hotel staff were now officially responsible for them, because the couple the parents had left them with were too drunk to look after them.\u0027The mum and step-dad had been taken away by the police and the children\u0027s entertainer had to stay in a room with there was no one else.\u0027Officials in Majorca said the police had been called after the mother allegedly assaulted one of the other women who had been looking after her daughters.Mrs Wignall says this was the drunk British woman, but this has not been confirmed. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: \u0027National Police officers have arrested a British couple who were on holiday as the suspected authors of a crime of child abandonment. \u0027In the early hours of Thursday morning and at a hotel in Playa de Palma, hotel security staff were alerted to the abandonment of two children by their parents.\u0027The family of four had arrived two days earlier. Following their arrival, the parents were usually drunk and would regularly leave the hotel and leave their children there.          The couple were arrested by Spanish police on Thursday and the children left with social services until their mother was released yesterday. Her partner was not allowed to fly home to Scotland with them. Pictured: Palma Bay Club resort \u0027After security staff warned them about their illegal behaviour, they convinced another British couple who they didn\u0027t know, to look after their children while they went drinking in different bars in the resort.\u0027They would return totally drunk. They returned in the same state in the early hours of Thursday morning.\u0027For no reason the mother assaulted the woman who had been looking after her children and hotel security, who subsequently alerted police, had to intervene.\u0027Officers arrested the couple after reaching the hotel. They also discovered the tourist who had agreed to look after the youngsters was under the effects of alcohol.\u0027Mrs Wignall says she \u0027has thought of nothing else\u0027 since she left Spain.She said: \u0027People keep asking me how my holiday was but I can\u0027t even talk about it.\u0027Those people had gone on holiday to get drunk and ignore their children.\u0027I was going out of my mind with worry, I barely thought about anything else.\u0027I was waiting to pick up my children from school yesterday and I just burst into tears.\u0027The mum was allowed to fly home with them, but the step-dad wasn\u0027t, that really distressed the kids.\u0027The whole thing is absolutely shocking. When you have children they are your responsibility and your responsibility alone.\u0027Taking to Facebook after she arrived back in the UK, Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees wrote: \u0027I\u0027ve had the best time away just me and my youngest but I\u0027m leaving Majorca today with a heavy heart.\u0027We\u0027ve spent the week with two little girls aged 4 and 11... mainly because their parents were always drunk.           The British tourists had been staying at the popular resort of Playa de Palma outside the capital of Majorca\u0027Last night it came to a head and both parents were arrested after the dad was paralytic drunk and the mom had left the girls to look after themselves after she left the resort to go and party on the strip.\u0027I took care of them girls for 3 hours looking for her mom and we couldn\u0027t find her anywhere. \u0027They wanted to stay in my room, even a strangers room they\u0027d only known 2 days, so they could be looked after but I told them I wasn\u0027t allowed to do that and hotel reception had to take care of them. \u0027The girl was calling her dad in Scotland for help. This morning I had to watch them two beautiful girls get taken away by Spanish social services and taken to a Spanish children\u0027s care centre as mom and dad have been arrested and in Palma cells. \u0027Never have I witnessed such awful disgusting parenting and fear in two small faces. \u0027Parents if you want a holiday abroad and get off your face leave your kids at home.\u0027       "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/11/4B5715A100000578-0-image-m-60_1524220572386.jpg","title":"Natalie Portman says backed prize Netanyahu","story":"Oscar-winning US-Israeli actress Natalie Portman says she will not attend a Jerusalem award ceremony because she does not want to appear to endorse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it,\u0027 the Oscar-winning US-Israeli actress said.\u0027Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation,\u0027 she said.Israeli politician calls for Natalie Portman to be stripped...Prince\u0027s original studio recording of \u0027Nothing Compares 2 U\u0027...George H.W.

I hope these kinds of books reflect this and inspire young minds to follow a more positive path.\u0027 More than 100,000 copies of the books around the world have already been pre-ordered. Good Night Stories for Rebel ...

The girls with a sample of their vast daily diet, which cost their father all his £35 monthly salary Their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 36, from a village in Gujarat, western India, said: ‘I cannot tell you how overjoyed we are. It’s been a long journey to get here and getting the right help with the right results. \u0027But we can already see results. We can see their features, they look like little girls. We are very happy and excited to see them getting better.’The sisters first hit international headlines in 2015 when Yogita weighed 5st 2lb and Amisha weighed 7st 4lb when they were only aged five and three respectively.Yogita and Amisha used to devour a heavy breakfast of chapatis (Indian bread), and six bananas and eight chapatis, half kilogram of rice and three bowls of curry for lunch and dinner as well as six packets of crisps, five packets of biscuits, a dozen bananas, a litre of milk, and a litre of Coke every day.Rameshbhai, who earns just Rs 3,000 (£35) a month as a labourer, used to spend all his money on food to fill his children’s large appetite.          Surgeons, including Dr Mahendra Narwaria, operate on Yogita at Asian Bariatrics Clinic, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat          A section of Yogita\u0027s stomach sits on a plate as surgeons finish her operation. The girls finally got surgery after a three year search He said: ‘I sometimes get paid Rs 100 a day and sometimes there is no work at all. I work in fields, dig wells and do whatever menial job I can to earn money. I used to always be worried about feeding my always-hungry children. I couldn’t leave them cry hungry. And when I had no money, I borrowed it from my brothers and friends.’But Rameshbhai quickly realised he was in fact hurting his children.A local government hospital offered to help the girls in 2015 after seeing newspaper articles and advised Rameshbhai not to overfeed his daughters. But even when their diet reduced to two chapatis and mixed vegetable broth for lunch and dinner, the girls continued to gain weight.For the next three years the family were sent from one hospital and doctor to another across India, seeking help, but no result or long term weight loss managed to help the girls get healthy.Moment morbidly obese sisters walk unaided for the first...One in five American children are obese - and the youngest...Child prostitute tells how she was kidnapped aged 11 and...Share this articleHowever, last month Asia’s top bariatric surgeon, Dr Mahendra Narwaria, from Asian Bariatrics Clinic, in Ahmedabad, western India, invited the family for a meeting.The family took a nine-hour train journey from their village to Ahmedabad and met with Dr Narwaria.Dr Narwaria promised Rameshbhai help, free of charge, and offered the sisters surgery to reduce their stomachs and long term consultations and guidance on permanent weight loss and a course of hormones and vitamins.‘I had seen the sisters in the newspapers,’ Dr Narwaria said. ‘But I always thought they would call or the government would get in touch for my help. Eventually, I realised they will not call, so I took the step.

These children need my help to first reduce their weight, and then go on a long-term plan to stabilise their condition. \u0027There is no name for their condition, they have a genetic problem and a Leptin receptor deficiency but if I can help them get better then I will. I never charge children for this surgery, these children urgently need help if there is any chance of them living a long life.’Last month, on March 6, Yogita an Amisha were taken into surgery to have a portion of their stomachs removed.By the next day, the girls were on a liquid only diet. And after seven days they began to slowly eat solid foods again, but much smaller portions.With no fuss at all, the girls were happy to follow their new diet plan, realising they were ‘too fat’.Before surgery, Yogita said: ‘One boy in my neighbourhood calls me ‘fatty’ and it makes me sad. I don’t like it. I want to lose weight so I can jump around with my friends.’          Yogita and Amisha taking their first steps without help after specialists put them on a restrictive diet because their parents were so concerned for their health in 2015. Despite the diet, they continued to put on weight          The girls riding on a motorbike with their parents, who say the operation has given them hope they can lead normal lives A month after surgery Yogita had lost 1st 4b and Amisha had lost 1st 5 lb, and both showing positive signs of losing more weight as the weeks pass.Mother Pragna Ben, now 32, a full time housewife, who has another daughter Bhavika, now nine, who is a normal weight, and youngest son, Harsh, now four, who already weighs 3st 8lb  but is not being treated yet, used to spend all her time in the kitchen.She said: ‘My days used to be filled with making chapatis and curry. And despite the heavy breakfast and lunch, they used to demand food all the time and cry and scream if they’re not fed. I was always in the kitchen cooking for them. But now they eat small meals, it is much more controlled.’Three years ago Rameshbhai was on the verge of selling one of his kidneys to afford medical help for his daughters, but now he is full of appreciation.He said: ‘There were times when I wondered if anyone would help. So many people came knocking on my door and they would leave me feeling full of hope, but they just wanted to see my daughters, they had no intentions of helping.‘Now, thanks to Dr Narwaria, my girls have hope. They now have a chance at living a better future. My wife and I were very naïve all those years ago.\u0027We used to think that if they cried for food then we had to feed them. We quickly realised that we had to be strict. \u0027But even when they had smaller meals they continued to gain weight. We felt hopeless. Together, as a team, we’ll now make sure our girls have a hope of a healthier future.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/17/4B6550C300000578-0-image-a-5_1524327274307.jpg","title":"Malcolm Turnbull plants underwhelming English oak British PM Theresa Mays private retreat","story":"    Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull planted this English oak at Chequers Court, the country retreat of UK leaders.

He did so only after much soul-searching and believes that if he hadn’t let go of his hatred, ‘I wouldn’t be here talking to you now’.Neville has long been regarded as a man of few words, but with forgiveness has come liberation. Today, the feelings he had kept locked deep inside for so many years come tumbling out.This is the first time he has spoken with such raw honesty about his personal struggles.‘I was so angry — even in my sleep, I’d be thinking bad thoughts. Gradually, I’ve let those thoughts go. I’ve got to the stage now where I don’t even remember the names of the guys who killed him. They used to be here.’ He taps his forehead. ‘Slowly, the anger is going away.’          Earlier this week, Neville Lawrence made a pilgrimage of sorts to the bus stop where his 18-year-old son, Stephen, was fatally stabbed 25 years agoToday, Neville, 76, looks a decade younger than the beleaguered man who stood on the Old Bailey steps when two of his son’s murderers, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, were sentenced to life imprisonment six years ago.Those convictions, the first since Stephen’s death, might well have been a victory for justice, but they didn’t ease Neville’s suffering. Nor the suffering of Stephen’s mother, Baroness Lawrence, who, in an emotional interview with this newspaper earlier this month, confessed she hasn’t known true happiness since her son’s death, and spoke of her desire to ‘draw a line’ under her tireless campaigning for Stephen.She also urged police, in the absence of significant leads, to close the investigation.Neville disagrees. ‘After the verdict, I went to my son’s grave in Jamaica. I know a lot of people would say you’re mad talking to somebody who’s dead, but I talk to him. I said: “We’ve got two of them, I don’t know if we’re going to get any more, but we have that satisfaction for the time being.” ’He falls silent and, for a moment, he is thousands of miles away, at the peaceful plot in Jamaica where his son lies buried in the shade of coconut and ackee trees. ‘Knowing my son’s lying there in the ground, sometimes I just go to pieces.‘Even now when I start talking about it, my eyes fill up because I know what kind of person he was — what kind of person he would have been.  For many years, Neville could not even bring himself to drive along the road in South-East London where his desperately wounded son ran for some 350 yards before he fell‘We had some justice, but I’m still hoping for total justice, which is why I don’t want them to close the case. I want them to scale the investigation down, but not close it.‘With all the publicity there is at the moment, someone might decide to come forward and say something they haven’t before.’This week, Stephen’s death has dominated the media.To mark the 25th anniversary, a gripping three-part BBC documentary, Stephen: The Murder That Changed A Nation, examined in forensic detail the senseless murder and the fight for justice, passionately championed by the Daily Mail, which led to the exposure of institutional racism running deep in the Metropolitan Police. The repercussions continue to reverberate throughout every level of society to this day.On Monday, leading dignitaries, including Prince Harry and Prime Minister Theresa May, will gather at a memorial service in London, organised by Baroness Lawrence, to remember Stephen and celebrate all that has been achieved in his name.Until three days ago, Neville thought he wouldn’t be there. He had not been invited, until Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick intervened. Neville does not dwell upon the reasons why he wasn’t on the guest list. He simply says: ‘I wanted to go. It’s my son, but I wasn’t the one arranging it, so what could I do?‘On Wednesday evening, the police commissioner phoned. She said she hadn’t seen an invitation for me, so now I’m going.’The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. In her interview with the Mail two weeks ago, Stephen’s mother said: ‘Neville and I were two different people after that night. They say a tragedy like that either pushes you together or pulls you apart. The latter is exactly what happened.    The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. Pictured: Doreen and Neville Lawrence at the first murder trial ‘In a way, I felt she was blaming me for Stephen’s death. Whether that was right or wrong, I don’t know, but that’s what I was feeling inside.‘Doreen was away on a field trip for her degree when Stephen was murdered. I was supposed to be looking after the children. If something happens to your child when one of you is away, straight away you start thinking: “If I’d been here, maybe it wouldn’t have happened.”‘She hasn’t said she blames me, but I think she does. I know I was blaming myself.’Neville, a talented plasterer and decorator, had been looking after the children for two days when Stephen left for school that day. By nature a warm, jovial man, his spirits had been worn down by a lack of work during the recession.The marriage was, he concedes, going through a difficult patch, but he believed the overriding love they had for their children would help them to weather it.‘I thought I wouldn’t have any children because it took so long to find someone I wanted to marry,’ says Neville. ‘I’d made this promise to myself I would not have a child out of wedlock. I wanted to be married to somebody, so my children could grow up in my house and I could have influence over them.‘Stephen was my first-born child. I was there when he arrived. When he came out of hospital, I was worried all night because there were a lot of cot deaths about at the time. I kept getting up to listen to him breathing.’          A memorial plaque now marks the place with the words: ‘In memory of Stephen Lawrence 13.9.1974 to 22.4.1993. May he Rest in Peace\u0027Neville was a hands-on father who changed nappies and fed his son. He still has the first pair of baby shoes Stephen wore. ‘When he left that day, I was sitting at the window feeling really low about the fact I wasn’t working to support my family.‘He said: “Dad, are you OK?” I said: “Yes I’m fine.” He said: “Are you sure?” I said: “Yes, and remember your mummy’s coming back tonight. I’m going to do dinner, so come straight home from school.” ’But Stephen didn’t come home.Instead, two neighbours knocked on the door to tell Doreen, by now home, and Neville, that Stephen had been attacked. They called police stations and searched the streets. Finding no sign of their son, they went to a nearby hospital and learned he had been admitted.‘When we got to the hospital, I asked where Stephen was. The doctor said: “We’re working on him.” They showed us to a waiting room. When I saw a nurse and doctor walking down the corridor, I’m thinking: “Please, God, let them tell me he’s going to be OK.” They told us he was dead.‘After touching my son on that hospital slab, I can remember nothing else.’Neville’s next memory is waking up the following morning. He thought his son’s death was a bad dream.‘The first thing I did was go to Stephen’s bedroom to see if his bed had been slept in. When I saw it hadn’t, I knew that what I’d remembered was true.‘For a few days, I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t even remember my full name. I was walking around kind of stunted in a way.‘It affected me so much. I was never the Neville who was here before Stephen was murdered. I was different.’          David Norris (left) and Gary Dobson were convicted of Stephen\u0027s murder six years ago    Luke Knight, 41, showed little remorse when confronted ahead of the 25th anniversaryBefore a reporter could question him, the roofer, wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt, shouted: ‘Oh, f*** off, mate,’ before slamming his door.His outburst came after the BBC broadcast the first of its three-part series on Britain’s most notorious race murder. Earlier, Knight had his trademark swagger as he walked down the street near where he and his cohorts once terrorised locals.In February 1997, the Mail accused Knight’s gang of murdering 18-year-old Stephen in a savage, unprovoked attack as he waited with a friend at a bus-stop on April 22, 1993.Two of the gang, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, are serving life for the killing, after a forensic breakthrough led to a second murder trial six years ago. A third, Neil Acourt, 42, is in jail for masterminding a £4 million cannabis ring.

Sense of history preferred. No salary.Sound familiar?Little wonder that the clunkingly obvious person for the job was formally endorsed as the next Head of the Commonwealth yesterday.It had been the Queen’s ‘sincere wish’ that the Prince of Wales should be acknowledged as her chosen successor to this non-hereditary role.So last night’s news, confirmed in the leaders’ statement at the close of the Commonwealth summit, will have come as an early present ahead of today’s celebrations for the Queen’s 92nd birthday.Yesterday, she was doing what she has enjoyed doing for the best part of seven decades as she surrounded herself with the leaders of the 53 Commonwealth nations. She invited them for drinks during their informal ‘retreat’ – the traditional finale of these summits – at Windsor Castle.She stayed well away from all the networking going on in the state apartments, where the politicians were berthed. Later, they were invited to her side of the castle for refreshments. The Prince of Wales, quite properly, was miles away.He will no doubt be pleased that this delicate succession issue has been resolved now, at a time of the Queen’s choosing rather than the Almighty’s.          The Prince of Wales greets the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting          Anita Sethi (right of photo, with glasses on her head) meeting Prince Charles at the Commonwealth People\u0027s Forum in LondonThere has been no change to the process, however, and the Royal Family have not sought one. They understand that the headship must be earned, and not simply inherited. The Duke of Cambridge is well aware of that.The only grudging footnote to Charles’s appointment as head-in-waiting was a bizarre claim in yesterday’s Guardian. A writer called Anita Sethi has written that she met the prince at this week’s Commonwealth People’s Forum.Ooops! The new Head of Commonwealth-elect Prince Charles...When can you start? Prince Charles to begin new role as Head...Share this articleAccording to her account, he deployed that trusty conversation-starter ‘And where are you from?’ – to which she replied: ‘Manchester’.She then says the prince joked: ‘Well, you don’t look like it!’ As a result, Miss Sethi, who is of Guyanese heritage, now argues that the prince is unfit to lead the Commonwealth.          Ms Sethi says Prince Charles told her \u0027you don\u0027t look like you\u0027re from Manchester\u0027             She then says the prince joked: ‘Well, you don’t look like it!’            I am intrigued by this exchange for many reasons – not least the fact that I, too, happened to be at this event. I certainly can’t claim to have heard everything the prince said, but I heard a fair bit and I didn’t hear him say this.The occasion, frankly, was a bunfight because so many people were jostling to meet him. He was doing the rounds of a London conference centre where thousands of delegates were attending four different forums.When he walked in to a buffet lunch for the Business Forum delegates, a band of drummers made so much noise that it was impossible to hear the prince say anything. It wasn’t very different two floors up at the People’s Forum where Miss Sethi was in the melee.The scrum got so bad that one veteran royal photographer simply gave up trying to take a picture and helped himself to a plate of curry. The organisers had tried to line up pre-arranged groups for royal introductions, but it turned in to a free-for-all.          Ms Sethi says she was \u0027stunned\u0027 by the prince\u0027s gaffe and she could \u0027show him her passport to prove where she was born\u0027In the midst of this good-natured shambles, Miss Sethi tried to draw the prince’s attention to her latest book – it was then the alleged exchange took place. Clarence House has opted for dignified silence. I can only say that the Sethi version of events bears no relation to the man I have seen in these situations over more than 25 years. The prince has always seen it as his role to act as a bridge between races and cultures, and has done so for longer than perhaps any politician or ‘community leader’ in Britain.Take his thoughts on the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants. ‘Thank you for coming and for your contributions to this country,’ he said to hundreds of families at a special Windrush party he organised at St James’s Palace.          Prince Charles greets Canadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauThis wasn’t the other day. It happened in 1998, two decades before those buffoons at the Home Office learned about the legacy of the Windrush.That same year, I followed him on tours of Sri Lanka and Nepal where he met thousands of people just like those he has been doing this week. No gaffes.Two years later, I followed him to the Caribbean. We ended up in Guyana, the country where members of Miss Sethi’s family were once indentured workers. There were many engagements in run-down areas of the capital, Georgetown. The prince met the most deprived members of society and went to see a local version of his Youth Business Trust. No gaffes. Ditto in South Africa, Lesotho, Jamaica, Malaysia, Singapore and Trinidad – all Commonwealth countries where I have been glued to the poor man’s every move.So is Charles, as he nears his 70th birthday, suddenly starting to lose the plot? I don’t think so. Having toured the Commonwealth since the age of five, he is manifestly suited to step in to the Queen’s oceanic Commonwealth shoes when the time comes. He must be the only person (except the Queen) who can identify all of the flags fluttering along the Mall this week.This is an organisation which cannot open its mouth without banging on about the fact that 60 per cent of its people are under 30. And guess who established the biggest youth charity network in Britain? This week, the Prince’s Trust International, its global arm, was round for tea at Clarence House.In fact, what is perhaps most striking about his appointment is the lack of controversy. When the EU, UN, Fifa or pretty much any other world body seeks a new head, there is usually a fratricidal dogfight. Here is an organisation ning 2.4billion people which has just had a selection process devoid of any rancour at all – with the possible exception of Jeremy Corbyn and Miss Sethi. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/03/4B5FF6FB00000578-5640333-image-a-52_1524279227631.jpg","title":"Single mother held watched Missouri home burn four children inside","story":"This photo provided by KYTV in Springfield, Missouri, shows the aftermath of a fire that killed the four Otto siblings in Lake Ozark on Thursday morning           The home, pictured above after the fire, was left in shambles, with holes in its roof and its walls burned entirely to the ground          Another view of the home reveals the severe damage to the side panels and walls           Mother Tina Brazil pictured above with her four children in an image from May 2017          Brazil\u0027s four sons died in the blaze, pictured above victims (from left to right) Levi Otto, four, Carson Otto, eight, Tyler Otto, 14, and Max Otto, five          The boys were home alone when the fire blazed. 14-year-old Tyler Otto (pictured riding an ATV) 8-year-old Carson Otto 5-year-old Max Otto and 4-year-old Levi Otto (pictured together in the wagon)\u0027My children!

We hope this indicates an effort to negotiate in good faith.\u0027We remain committed to working with our international partners to bring about our goal of a complete, verifiable and irreversible de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and to do so through peaceful means.\u0027The US-North Korea meeting is scheduled for May or June, although no location has been decided plans are continuing apace, with CIA director Mike Pompeo flying to Pyongyang for talks with Kim over the Easter weekend.South Korean President Moon Jae-in is also due to meet the dictator on April 27 at a border truce village for a rare summit focused on nuclear issues.President Trump heralded Friday\u0027s announcement, tweeting: \u0027North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.\u0027He later added: \u0027A message from Kim Jong Un: \u0027North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u0027 Also will \u0027Shut down a nuclear test site in the country\u0027s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.\u0027 Progress being made for all!\u0027 South Korea also welcomed the decision, saying it represented \u0027meaningful progress for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\u0027.But Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said he was not satisfied with the announcement, and demanded pressure be kept up on North Korea until it abandons its missile programme in a complete, irreversible and verifiable way. The decision was made in a meeting of the ruling party\u0027s full Central Committee which had convened to discuss a \u0027new stage\u0027 of policies.  Secret footage of Kim Jong-un\u0027s \u0027slaves\u0027: North Koreans...Kremlin says Trump offered to visit RUSSIA in exchange for...North and South Korea open a telephone hotline between...Share this article    Kim speaking at the Seventh Central Committee of the Workers\u0027 Party of Korea on Friday in an image released by the official Korean Central News Agency  Pyongyang has made rapid technological progress in its weapons programmes under Kim, which has seen it subjected to increasingly strict sanctions by the UN Security Council, US, EU, South Korea and others.  Pictured: A missile launch in North Korean last yearFriday\u0027s move comes after months of threats and counter-threats between President Trump and Kim. At his New Year speech, the dictator claimed to have a nuclear button on his desk, prompting Trump to tweet that he had an even bigger one. Events have moved rapidly since then, catalyzed by the Winter Olympics in the South, and Seoul is now pushing for a peace treaty to formally end the Korean War, raising hopes that a settlement could finally be reached on the peninsula.But there is a long way to go and Moon himself acknowledged this week that the \u0027devil is in the details\u0027. On Thursday, the South\u0027s president revealed that Kim had expressed his commitment to \u0027complete denuclearization\u0027 of the Korean peninsula without seeking conditions.          South Korean President Moon Jae-in (right, on April 18) will hold a summit with Kim in a border truce village on April 27          Pyongyang toned down its rhetoric after Kim announced in his New Year\u0027s address his plan to improve relations with Seoul and send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February.

On Thursday, President Trump told a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that his campaign of \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 on North Korea would continue until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weaponsIn a further development on Wednesday, Seoul said it hopes to use the up-coming summit  to change a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a peace agreement. China, Kim\u0027s main ally, immediately announced it backed the move.Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Moon said he saw the possibility of a peace agreement, or even international aid for the North\u0027s economy, if it denuclearizes.But he also said the inter-Korean summit had \u0027a lot of constraints\u0027, in that the two Koreas could not make progress separate from the North Korea-United States summit, and could not reach an agreement that transcends international sanctions.\u0027So first, the South-North Korean summit must make a good beginning, and the dialogue between the two Koreas likely must continue after we see the results of the North Korea-United States summit,\u0027 Moon said.  South Korean army soldiers pass by a wire fence decorated with ribbons written with messages wishing for the reunification of the two Koreas at the Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, South Korea, on April 20.

This was the row of seats where the window was shattered. Jennifer Riordan was sitting in the window and was partially sucked out before passengers were able to drag her back in          Passenger Marty Martinez shared photographs and videos of himself on Facebook as the plane made its descent. He and other passengers are shown terrified as they hold their oxygen masks to their faces. He later said there was \u0027blood everywhere\u0027 as a result of the woman\u0027s injuries \u0027The unsafe condition,\u0027 the FAA said in the order, \u0027is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.\u0027The inspections ordered are a sharp step-up from actions by both the European and U.S. regulators after a Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. The European agency had given airlines nine months to check engines, while U.S. regulators still were considering what to do.Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required in the next 20 days, the agencies said on Friday. A cycle includes one take-off and landing.  Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two from Albuquerque, died. Southwest Airlines would not reveal on Friday if it had offered her family anything in the form of compensation That order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the United States, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday\u0027s Southwest flight would have been affected, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.The coordinated 20-day measure partially resolves a gap in previous responses to the 2016 accident by the world\u0027s two largest and most influential aviation regulators, a person familiar with the discussions said and published documents show.The FAA in August 2017 drafted an order giving airline up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalized the measure by the time of Tuesday\u0027s fatal second accident.The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, matching the FAA\u0027s roll-out, saying data did not justify that.The ergence marked a rare difference of approach between the two agencies, especially on one of the world\u0027s most-used aviation products. CFM, which is jointly owned by General Electric Co and France\u0027s Safran, produces the CFM56 engine in factories based both in the United States and in Europe.\u0027It happens that there are disagreements about the right way to go in some cases, and this was one of them,\u0027 the person familiar with the discussions said.On Tuesday, however, when news broke that a second failure had taken place involving the same model engine, aircraft and airline - this time killing a passenger who was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat - the two agencies agreed to act quickly, the person said.          Riordan\u0027s window was smashed by shrapnel from the exploding engine several rows in front of herAn FAA spokesman said the agency disputed that it had not agreed with European regulators on the response to the engine issue. An EASA spokesman declined to comment.On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of U.S. aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.The FAA and NTSB have different roles. Investigators study the probable cause of single accidents and recommend possible changes to safety rules, while regulators have to assess whether safety risks could appear.Several major airline officials said the order will primarily impact airlines with higher utilization of aircraft covering shorter routes like Southwest.The airline\u0027s CEO Gary Kelly sent a letter to the 142 passengers who survived, apologizing for the \u0027circumstances\u0027 which surrounded the flight and offering their help reuniting them with luggage.No blame has been assigned to the airline for the engine explosion which sent a piece of shrapnel flying through the window next to Riordan.Investigators are still probing what caused the explosion and the plane had been tested for safety just three days before the catastrophe. In its letter, Southwest Airlines pointed to the ongoing National Transport Safety Board investigation into the incident but said its priority was assisting the traumatized survivors. Southwest Airlines is giving passengers on board the disastrous flight $5,000 each and a $1,000 travel voucher. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/186E725E00000514-0-image-a-103_1524235935111.jpg","title":"Woman looked couples children holiday Majorca says couldve Madeleine McCann","story":"    Two Scottish girls aged 4 and 11 were left on their own at the Club Palma Bay resort in Majorca (pictured) while their mother and step-father \u0027went out and got drunk\u0027British couple are arrested \u0027for leaving their children with...Share this articleThe mother-of-two from Blackpool claims the youngsters were left with four different families over the course of two days and had to stay in a room with the hotel\u0027s children entertainer when the couple were arrested. She told MailOnline she \u0027hasn\u0027t stopped thinking about their little faces\u0027 since she flew home on Thursday.Mrs Wignall said: \u0027When I left the hotel to go to the airport I couldn\u0027t stop crying.\u0027I could cry now just thinking about how I had to walk away from those children knowing anyone could have picked them up.\u0027It could\u0027ve been another Maddie McCann story, they didn\u0027t know how much danger they were in.\u0027It\u0027s absolutely disgusting, they don\u0027t deserve to have children, let alone take them abroad.\u0027           Amanda Wignall (pictured), 37, was staying at the same resort with her husband and four-year-old son when she spotted the two girls dancing on their own and became extremely concernedThree-year-old Madeleine McCann disappeared from her hotel room in the Algarve in Portugal in May 2007 and has never been seen since. A child protection meeting is due to take place where the girls live in Scotland on Monday, where the 11-year-old girl\u0027s father is reportedly trying to get custody of her.Mrs Wignall claims she has been in contact with the girl\u0027s father to confirm they got home safely. She says she first spotted the youngsters at the hotel\u0027s children disco on Tuesday evening after flying out with her family on Sunday.She claims the 11-year-old told her \u0027in no uncertain terms\u0027 it wasn\u0027t the first time her mother and step-father, believed to be in their late 40s or early 50s, had abandoned them on holiday.She said: \u0027The eldest told me they\u0027d been on holiday before and the step-dad and her mum had gone out drinking and left them on their own.\u0027All that little girl did the whole holiday was look after her little sister. Neither of them would\u0027ve eaten anything if it wasn\u0027t for her.\u0027Mrs Wignall bumped into a friend of hers called Kate on the first day of the holiday and after spending time with her, realised she had been looking after the girls as well.The women claim they would look after the girls whenever they saw them around the hotel but they were often left with other families while their parents were out on the strip or at the bar.          Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees took to Facebook to share the \u0027shocking\u0027 story She told MailOnline: \u0027The first time I saw them I felt very uncomfortable.\u0027One night we saw them on their own and when we eventually found the mum she was absolutely paralytic. \u0027She was so drunk she couldn\u0027t even lift her head up to speak to us, let alone string a sentence together.\u0027I don\u0027t know where the step-dad was. The eldest kept saying she had to ring her dad in Scotland, we didn\u0027t know what was going on.\u0027On the final night of her stay Mrs Wignall saw the girls again and asked who would be looking after them when her and her friend had gone.She claims they told her a young couple from Wigan had agreed to take care of them while their parents went out.But when she came to check out in the early hours of Thursday reception staff told her the girls had been taken off the couple because they were also too drunk and their parents had been arrested.She said: \u0027When I left on Thursday I told the receptionist I had serious concerns about two young children staying in the hotel.           Mrs Wignall said the children \u0027could have ended up like Maddie McCann (pictured), who disappeared from her family\u0027s hotel room in Portugal in 2007 \u0027They said the father had been arrested and the hotel staff were now officially responsible for them, because the couple the parents had left them with were too drunk to look after them.\u0027The mum and step-dad had been taken away by the police and the children\u0027s entertainer had to stay in a room with there was no one else.\u0027Officials in Majorca said the police had been called after the mother allegedly assaulted one of the other women who had been looking after her daughters.Mrs Wignall says this was the drunk British woman, but this has not been confirmed. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: \u0027National Police officers have arrested a British couple who were on holiday as the suspected authors of a crime of child abandonment. \u0027In the early hours of Thursday morning and at a hotel in Playa de Palma, hotel security staff were alerted to the abandonment of two children by their parents.\u0027The family of four had arrived two days earlier. Following their arrival, the parents were usually drunk and would regularly leave the hotel and leave their children there.          The couple were arrested by Spanish police on Thursday and the children left with social services until their mother was released yesterday. Her partner was not allowed to fly home to Scotland with them. Pictured: Palma Bay Club resort \u0027After security staff warned them about their illegal behaviour, they convinced another British couple who they didn\u0027t know, to look after their children while they went drinking in different bars in the resort.\u0027They would return totally drunk. They returned in the same state in the early hours of Thursday morning.\u0027For no reason the mother assaulted the woman who had been looking after her children and hotel security, who subsequently alerted police, had to intervene.\u0027Officers arrested the couple after reaching the hotel. They also discovered the tourist who had agreed to look after the youngsters was under the effects of alcohol.\u0027Mrs Wignall says she \u0027has thought of nothing else\u0027 since she left Spain.She said: \u0027People keep asking me how my holiday was but I can\u0027t even talk about it.\u0027Those people had gone on holiday to get drunk and ignore their children.\u0027I was going out of my mind with worry, I barely thought about anything else.\u0027I was waiting to pick up my children from school yesterday and I just burst into tears.\u0027The mum was allowed to fly home with them, but the step-dad wasn\u0027t, that really distressed the kids.\u0027The whole thing is absolutely shocking. When you have children they are your responsibility and your responsibility alone.\u0027Taking to Facebook after she arrived back in the UK, Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees wrote: \u0027I\u0027ve had the best time away just me and my youngest but I\u0027m leaving Majorca today with a heavy heart.\u0027We\u0027ve spent the week with two little girls aged 4 and 11... mainly because their parents were always drunk.           The British tourists had been staying at the popular resort of Playa de Palma outside the capital of Majorca\u0027Last night it came to a head and both parents were arrested after the dad was paralytic drunk and the mom had left the girls to look after themselves after she left the resort to go and party on the strip.\u0027I took care of them girls for 3 hours looking for her mom and we couldn\u0027t find her anywhere. \u0027They wanted to stay in my room, even a strangers room they\u0027d only known 2 days, so they could be looked after but I told them I wasn\u0027t allowed to do that and hotel reception had to take care of them. \u0027The girl was calling her dad in Scotland for help.

The girls with a sample of their vast daily diet, which cost their father all his £35 monthly salary Their father Rameshbhai Nandwana, 36, from a village in Gujarat, western India, said: ‘I cannot tell you how overjoyed we are. It’s been a long journey to get here and getting the right help with the right results. \u0027But we can already see results. We can see their features, they look like little girls. We are very happy and excited to see them getting better.’The sisters first hit international headlines in 2015 when Yogita weighed 5st 2lb and Amisha weighed 7st 4lb when they were only aged five and three respectively.Yogita and Amisha used to devour a heavy breakfast of chapatis (Indian bread), and six bananas and eight chapatis, half kilogram of rice and three bowls of curry for lunch and dinner as well as six packets of crisps, five packets of biscuits, a dozen bananas, a litre of milk, and a litre of Coke every day.Rameshbhai, who earns just Rs 3,000 (£35) a month as a labourer, used to spend all his money on food to fill his children’s large appetite.          Surgeons, including Dr Mahendra Narwaria, operate on Yogita at Asian Bariatrics Clinic, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat          A section of Yogita\u0027s stomach sits on a plate as surgeons finish her operation. The girls finally got surgery after a three year search He said: ‘I sometimes get paid Rs 100 a day and sometimes there is no work at all. I work in fields, dig wells and do whatever menial job I can to earn money. I used to always be worried about feeding my always-hungry children. I couldn’t leave them cry hungry. And when I had no money, I borrowed it from my brothers and friends.’But Rameshbhai quickly realised he was in fact hurting his children.A local government hospital offered to help the girls in 2015 after seeing newspaper articles and advised Rameshbhai not to overfeed his daughters. But even when their diet reduced to two chapatis and mixed vegetable broth for lunch and dinner, the girls continued to gain weight.For the next three years the family were sent from one hospital and doctor to another across India, seeking help, but no result or long term weight loss managed to help the girls get healthy.Moment morbidly obese sisters walk unaided for the first...One in five American children are obese - and the youngest...Child prostitute tells how she was kidnapped aged 11 and...Share this articleHowever, last month Asia’s top bariatric surgeon, Dr Mahendra Narwaria, from Asian Bariatrics Clinic, in Ahmedabad, western India, invited the family for a meeting.The family took a nine-hour train journey from their village to Ahmedabad and met with Dr Narwaria.Dr Narwaria promised Rameshbhai help, free of charge, and offered the sisters surgery to reduce their stomachs and long term consultations and guidance on permanent weight loss and a course of hormones and vitamins.‘I had seen the sisters in the newspapers,’ Dr Narwaria said. ‘But I always thought they would call or the government would get in touch for my help. Eventually, I realised they will not call, so I took the step.

These children need my help to first reduce their weight, and then go on a long-term plan to stabilise their condition. \u0027There is no name for their condition, they have a genetic problem and a Leptin receptor deficiency but if I can help them get better then I will. I never charge children for this surgery, these children urgently need help if there is any chance of them living a long life.’Last month, on March 6, Yogita an Amisha were taken into surgery to have a portion of their stomachs removed.By the next day, the girls were on a liquid only diet. And after seven days they began to slowly eat solid foods again, but much smaller portions.With no fuss at all, the girls were happy to follow their new diet plan, realising they were ‘too fat’.Before surgery, Yogita said: ‘One boy in my neighbourhood calls me ‘fatty’ and it makes me sad. I don’t like it. I want to lose weight so I can jump around with my friends.’          Yogita and Amisha taking their first steps without help after specialists put them on a restrictive diet because their parents were so concerned for their health in 2015. Despite the diet, they continued to put on weight          The girls riding on a motorbike with their parents, who say the operation has given them hope they can lead normal lives A month after surgery Yogita had lost 1st 4b and Amisha had lost 1st 5 lb, and both showing positive signs of losing more weight as the weeks pass.Mother Pragna Ben, now 32, a full time housewife, who has another daughter Bhavika, now nine, who is a normal weight, and youngest son, Harsh, now four, who already weighs 3st 8lb  but is not being treated yet, used to spend all her time in the kitchen.She said: ‘My days used to be filled with making chapatis and curry. And despite the heavy breakfast and lunch, they used to demand food all the time and cry and scream if they’re not fed. I was always in the kitchen cooking for them. But now they eat small meals, it is much more controlled.’Three years ago Rameshbhai was on the verge of selling one of his kidneys to afford medical help for his daughters, but now he is full of appreciation.He said: ‘There were times when I wondered if anyone would help. So many people came knocking on my door and they would leave me feeling full of hope, but they just wanted to see my daughters, they had no intentions of helping.‘Now, thanks to Dr Narwaria, my girls have hope. They now have a chance at living a better future. My wife and I were very naïve all those years ago.\u0027We used to think that if they cried for food then we had to feed them. We quickly realised that we had to be strict. \u0027But even when they had smaller meals they continued to gain weight. We felt hopeless. Together, as a team, we’ll now make sure our girls have a hope of a healthier future.’ "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19dfba37d5f8e247bcbb3bbfd2e0c8de6cb98e30/109_38_1436_862/master/1436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82ebde5fc1347fa1940acfda96f09ee5","title":"frida kahlo barbie doll mexico injunction","story":"Distant relatives of Frida Kahlo have won a temporary injunction that stops sales of a Barbie doll depicting the late Mexican artist.Kahlo’s great-niece Mara de Anda Romeo argued in a Mexican court that Mattel does not have the rights to use Kahlo’s image as part of its Inspiring Women series.According to a copy of a ruling posted on Thursday, the toymaker and department stores in Mexico must stop commercializing the doll until the issue is resolved.Mattel has said it worked with the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corporation which it claims has rights to the artist’s image.In a Twitter post, the family’s official account, @FridaKahlo, wrote that a Mexico City judge had ordered the Frida Kahlo Corporation to stop using the “brand, image and work of the illustrious painter Frida Kahlo” without permission from the owner of the rights. Critics say the doll does not reflect Kahlo’s heavy, nearly conjoined eyebrows, and its costume does not accurately portray her elaborate Tehuana-style dresses.Barbie is an American icon that has often been criticised as promoting an unrealistic body image and consumerist lifestyle. Kahlo was a lifelong communist who died in 1954. Last month, Mattel said in a statement that it worked with the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corp, “which owns all the rights”. “The Frida Kahlo Corporation actively participated in the process of designing the doll, Mattel has its permission and a legal contract that grants it the rights to make a doll of the great Frida Kahlo,” the company’s statement said. The corporation said it got the rights through Kahlo’s niece, Isolda Pinedo Kahlo, more than a decade ago. The corporation said that it “celebrates the ideological contributions of Frida Kahlo which have transcended the borders of art and which will influence new generations as a world icon through the Frida Kahlo Barbie, which conserves the essence of Barbie and the legacy of Frida Kahlo”.Barbie marked International Women’s day in March by choosing 17 modern-day and historic role models to honour with a doll in their likeness.Included in the brand’s Inspiring Women series alongside Kahlo are the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart and Katherine Johnson, the Nasa mathematician who broke race and gender barriers. Johnson, who is now aged 99, was featured in the recent film Hidden Figures.

Workers from the parks department lifted the bronze statue on a forklift, wrapped Sims’ head in a felt blanket and drove him away on a flatbed truck.While Sims is known as the grandfather of gynecology to some, he is known as a torturer to others. The 19th-century doctor performed experimental surgeries on enslaved black women throughout his career, and chose not to use anesthesia.The removal of his 80-year-old statue comes after eight years of protests, activism and the local community collecting more than 26,000 signatures, which were brought to the attention of city officials. New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, agreed to relocate the controversial monument in January, though public protests hit their peak last summer. The city’s Public Design Commission approved the move on Monday and the next day, the statue was removed.A roaring crowd gathered in Central Park for the removal. Some locals said their “ancestors can rest”, while another held up a sign that read “Believe black women”. In the crowds, it was reported someone hollered: “Off with his head!” “To hail Sims as a hero was inappropriate and out of bounds,” said the deputy borough president of Manhattan, Matthew S Washington, who has been working on the statue’s removal since 2010. “It got to a real boiling point in New York, so we put together a coalition of community members who have continued to stand together and say ‘we no longer stand for this and we are going to fight until it’s gone’.”Following the controversy around Confederate monuments after a far-right rally last summer, this is one of many statues coming down. But where should it go?“My opinion is that the statue should be melted down and cast that metal into a statue that Sims brutalized, that would be appropriate,” said Washington. “His podium is still there in Central Park, we think it should be resurfaced as a blank podium, so the work continues.”One local organization, East Harlem Preservation, has been fighting for the Sims sculpture to be taken down since Viola Plummer, an 81-year-old black activist first called attention to Sims’ torture techniques in 2006, the same year a book about him was published, entitled Medical Apartheid.“Throughout our campaign, we maintained that the statue’s presence did a huge disservice to the neighborhood’s majority black and Latino residents, groups that have historically been subjected to medical experiments without permission or regard for their wellbeing,” said the group’s founder, Marina Ortiz. “Dr Sims is not our hero, and we don’t need any reminders of his barbarities.”Ortiz says she would rather see other doctors honored in Central Park who reflect the local community, like the first African-American female physician Dr Rebecca Lee Crumpler, who worked in Boston during the 19th century, and Helen Rodríguez Trías, a Latina pediatrician and women’s rights activist, who died in 2001.“These are the ‘sheroes’ that residents would prefer to learn about as they stroll near Central Park, confident in the understanding that black lives matter,” she said. The Sims sculpture has been relocated to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, which is where the doctor is buried. According to the cemetery’s president, Richard J Moylan, the statue was “immediately placed in storage until Green-Wood can construct the historical display that will put Sims’ life and work into context,” he said. “Ultimately, the sculpture will be placed near Sims’ gravesite.”Moylan intends to make sure Sims’ entire history be told.“As a national historic landmark, the responsibility to preserve this history, and not to whitewash it, is something Green-Wood takes very seriously,” he said. But Ortiz and the East Harlem Preservation are not satisfied with the decision to move the statue to Brooklyn. “New York City should not be keeping white supremacy on any pedestal and certainly not in another community of color,” she said. “We humbly suggest that the city bury the statue at Sims’ gravesite if they insist on having it there.” To JC Hallman, who is writing a book about Sims called The Anarcha Quest: The Story of a Slave and a Surgeon, thinks there is a lot of work to be done. “It’s the first time, and hopefully not the last, that a statue in New York City was removed explicitly because of questions about the content of the monument,” said Hallman. “It paves the way for future efforts to get history right, which is absolutely essential in an era when news and truth itself are under attack.” Not everyone agrees. Michele Bogart, a professor of art history at the Stony Brook University in New York, says the Sims statue should have stayed in Central Park. “People think that older public sculptures somehow continue to celebrate their subjects, but that doesn’t have to be the case at all, it certainly isn’t for me,” said Bogart. “It’s a problem for everyone right now because all anyone can see is racial ide – which is understandable. But it puts blinders on people.”There are still monuments honoring Sims across the country one stands in the grounds of the state house in Columbia, South Carolina, which has seen protests for its removal. There is also a building honoring Sims at the department of health and environmental control building on the campus of the University of South Carolina.The mayor of Columbia, Steve Benjamin, has said he is more offended by the statue of Sims than any Confederate memorial. “It should have come down at some point,” he told MSNBC, explaining that Sims “tortured slave women and children for years as he developed his treatments for gynecology”.There is also a Sims monument to the entranceway to the Alabama Capitol building in Montgomery, Alabama, the same city where Sims had his “backyard Montgomery hospital”, where he experimented surgeries on slave women, one of whom endured 30 surgeries.While a painting of Sims was removed from the University of Alabama Birmingham in 2006, removing the statue is not possible, as the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017 means anyone tearing down monuments in Alabama could be fined $25,000.But Michelle Browder, a Montgomery-based educator, doesn’t think the local statue of Sims should be removed. “Take it down for whom, for what – to sanitize the history as if it never happened?” she asks. “If he wasn’t at the Capitol, you would have no reason tell the kids of his heinous acts of crime against black women.”The solution, she adds, could be one of addition, rather than removal. “I am in favor of erecting a statue beside Sims honoring the mothers of gynecology, to share their contributions to science and medicine that helps all women,” she said. “We want the world to know that black women are stronger than any other race of women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fec92bb9f43251291dd6c35e994d89d837e361d/0_20_5949_3570/master/5949.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb6eb25c6c2872f4771e0ca378d7f3ab","title":"50 years british photography twiggy whaling in pictures","story":"The Association of Photographers, which represents the UK’s professional photographers, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with AOP50, a retrospective of images curated by Zelda Cheatle.

It seemed an astonishing thing for a candidate to say people campaigning for president usually glorify the nation they hope to lead, flattering voters into choosing them. But this reversal was just a taste of what was to come, as he revealed an unnerving skill at twisting what would be negative for anyone else into a positive for himself.By the time he won the election, Trump had flipped much of what many people thought they knew about the US on its head. In his acceptance speech he again pronounced the American dream dead, but promised to revive it. We were told that this dream of prosperity was under threat, so much so that a platform of “economic nationalism” carried the presidency.Reading last rites over the American dream was disquieting enough. But throughout the campaign, Trump also promised to put America first, a pledge renewed – twice – in his inaugural address. It was a disturbing phrase think pieces on the slogan’s history began to sprout up, explaining that it stretches back to efforts to keep the US out of the second world war.In fact, “America first” has a much longer and darker history than that, one deeply entangled with the country’s brutal legacy of slavery and white nationalism, its conflicted relationship to immigration, nativism and xenophobia. Gradually, the complex and often terrible tale this slogan represents was lost to mainstream history – but kept alive by underground fascist movements. “America first” is, to put it plainly, a dog whistle. The expression’s backstory seems at first to uncannily anticipate Trump and (at least some of) his supporters, but the truth is that eruptions of American conservative populism are nothing new – and “America first” has been associated with them for well over a century. This is merely the latest iteration of a powerful strain of populist demagoguery in American history, from president Andrew Jackson (1829-1837) to Louisiana senator Huey Long a century later – one that now extends to Trump.The slogan appears at least as early as 1884, when a California paper ran “America First and Always” as the headline of an article about fighting trade wars with the British. The New York Times shared in 1891 “the idea that the Republican Party has always believed in”, namely: “America first the rest of the world afterward”. The Republican party agreed, adopting the phrase as a campaign slogan by 1894.A few years later, “See America First” had become the ubiquitous slogan of the newly burgeoning American tourist industry, one that adapted easily as a political promise. This was recognised by an Ohio newspaper owner named Warren G Harding, who successfully campaigned for senator in 1914 under the banner “Prosper America First”. The expression did not become a national catchphrase, however, until April 1915, when President Woodrow Wilson gave a speech defending US neutrality during the first world war: “Our whole duty for the present, at any rate, is summed up in the motto: ‘America First’.”American opinion was deeply ided over the war while many decried what was widely perceived as a baldly nationalist venture by Germany, there was plenty of anti-British sentiment, too, especially among Irish-Americans. American neutrality was by no means always motivated by pure isolationism it mingled pacifism, anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, nationalism and exceptionalism as well. Wilson was delivering the “America first” speech with his eye on a second presidential term: “America first” should not be understood “in a selfish spirit”, he insisted. “The basis of neutrality is sympathy for mankind.”The phrase was rapidly taken up in the name of isolationism, however, and by 1916 “America first” had become so popular that both presidential candidates used it as a campaign slogan. When the US joined the war in 1917, “America first” was transposed into a jingoistic motto after the war, it slipped back into isolationism. In the summer of 1920, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge delivered a keynote speech at the Republican National Convention, denouncing the League of Nations in the name of “America first”. Harding secured the Republican nomination and promptly sailed to victory that November using the slogan, which his administration would invoke ceaselessly before it collapsed amid the ruins of the US’s greatest political bribery scandal to date.It should come as little surprise, then, that the Ku Klux Klan also adopted “America first” as a motto. In 1919 a Klan leader gave a Fourth of July speech declaring: “I am for America, first, last and all the time, and I don’t want any foreign element telling us what to do.” The fantasy of a US once populated solely by the racially pure Nordic “common man” was the Klan’s genesis myth as well, the prelapsarian past to which they intended to force the country to return – by violence if necessary. The autumn of 1922 also saw the first mention of a rising German fringe politician called Adolf Hitler in the US press. At the time, a young American journalist named Dorothy Thompson was living in Vienna, where she was reporting on the rise of antisemitism. By November 1923, she was in Munich trying to interview Hitler following his abortive Beer Hall Putsch, filing articles on the way he had updated German nationalism thanks to “suggestions from Mussolini”.There should be no misunderstanding about the Klan. It represents in this country the same ideas that Mussolini represents in Italy that Primo Rivera represents in Spain. The Klan is the American Fascista, determined to rule in its own way, in utter disregard of the fundamental laws and principles of democratic government.If such people were allowed to take over the US, it cautioned, “we shall have a dictatorship”.By 1927, the Klan had spread across the country. That May, roughly 1,000 Klansmen gathered to march in the Memorial Day parade in Queens, New York, many in white robes and hoods, accompanied by 400 members of their women’s organisation, the Klavana. Some of the reported 20,000 spectators in Queens that day objected to the Klan’s presence in a civic parade fights broke out, and it turned into a riot. In the days that followed, the New York papers revealed the names of a total of seven men who had been arrested in Queens. Five of them were identified as “avowed Klansmen” who had been marching in the parade and were arrested for “refusing to disperse when ordered”. A sixth was a mistake – a car had run over his foot – and he was immediately released. The seventh, a 21-year-old German-American, was not identified in the press as a Klansman. The reports only stated that he was arrested, arraigned and discharged. No one knows why he was there. His name was Fred Trump.In September 1935, a month after announcing he would run for president, Senator Long of Louisiana was assassinated. Called “America’s first dictator”, Long had worried many observers with his blend of populism and authoritarianism. After his death, one writer referred to Long as “the Mississippi valley rendering of Il Duce”. Despite assurances from many Americans that it can’t happen here, Long’s rise to power had shown just how it could. Its growing presence was so clear that at the end of 1935 Sinclair Lewis published a novel inspired by Long’s career (but written before his murder), in which he imagined what American fascism would look like. The title of It Can’t Happen Here was “ironical”, Lewis told reporters: “I don’t say fascism will happen here,” he said, “only that it could.”Lewis and Thompson had married in 1928, and his novel was heavily influenced by her circle’s conversation about the situation in Europe. She had just become the first American foreign correspondent to be ejected from Germany by Hitler, making her an international celebrity. “Whatever else the Hitler revolution may or may not be,” she wrote, “it is an enormous mass flight from reality.” On her return to the US, Thompson was given a nationally syndicated newspaper column immediately she began writing about the emergence of bands of loosely organised fascists around the US, where a “Union party” had assembled to unite the right, creating an amalgamation of white supremacist fascist groups.One of Thompson’s columns on American fascism was titled “It Can Happen Here”, in which she asked:Whom do they hate? Life, which has treated them badly. Who is to blame? Some scapegoat is to blame. The Negroes working in the fields that should be theirs? Or the Jews? Do they not keep the prosperous shops? Or the Communists … or the trade unionists … Or the Catholics who have a Pope in Rome? Or the foreigners who take the jobs? These are to blame. Therefore exterminate them. We are poor and dispossessed. But we are white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant. Our fathers founded this country. It belongs to us.Just as Thompson’s column was published, in May 1936, William Faulkner finished Absalom, Absalom!, a novel driven by the proposition that what had defined southern history was the fact that poor white people gained self-respect and racial pride from their belief in their inherent superiority to black people. If that sense of racial superiority were ever threatened, the story predicted, they would erupt in violence. A year earlier, WEB Du Bois had explained that “white laborers were convinced that the degradation of Negro labor was more fundamental than the uplift of white labor”. Although white labourers remained poor, Du Bois wrote, they were “compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage”, the wage of racial superiority.In the autumn of 1940, a coalition of Americans against US entry into the second world war formed the America First Committee. Charles Lindbergh would become their spokesman, Thompson perhaps their fiercest opponent. “I am absolutely certain in my mind that Lindbergh is pro-Nazi,” she wrote in 1941. “He hates the present democratic system and … intends to be President of the United States, with a new party along Nazi lines behind him.” By May 1941, Lewis had joined the America First Committee, while he and Thompson had quietly separated. According to Lewis’s biographer, he was “at that time vigorously opposed to American intervention in the European war … his sympathies with the America First people”.In August 2017, seven months into Donald Trump’s presidency, a coalition of American fascists calling themselves Unite the Right staged a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. It came as a shock to many observers that the Klan and neo-Nazis could march in modern America, shouting: “Jews will not replace us.” It came as a greater shock that Trump refused to condemn them.When the story emerged during the 2016 campaign that Trump’s father had been arrested at what was often described (erroneously) as a “Klan rally”, Trump at first denied that the Fred Trump in question was his father, saying they’d never lived at the address named in the newspaper reports. But although Donald never lived there, the Trump family did. There is no evidence that Fred was at the 1927 Memorial Day parade to support the Klan. What’s remarkable is that, of the parade’s 20,000 spectators, the only six who were arraigned after the riots were five “avowed Klansmen”, and Fred Trump.Donald has spoken often, and proudly, of the father he idolised. “My legacy has its roots in my father’s legacy,” he stated in 2015. There is good reason to think eugenics plays a role in that legacy. “The family subscribes to a racehorse theory of human development,” said one of Trump’s biographers, Michael D’Antonio. “They believe that there are superior people and that if you put together the genes of a superior woman and a superior man, you get a superior offspring.” Trump also endorsed a garbled version of eugenics in a 2010 interview: “I think I was born with the drive for success because I have a certain gene. I’m a gene believer.” And while it is true that no one knows why Fred Trump was arrested along with five members of the Klan in 1927, it is also true that his later record would not suggest he was there to protest against the Klan. Maybe it was all just a coincidence. We cannot hear a dog whistle if we are not in its range. We cannot understand the subtexts of our own slogans if we do not understand their contexts we risk misreading our own moment if we don’t know the historical meanings of expressions we resuscitate, or perpetuate. We are all asking urgent questions about the present, but there are far more surprising answers than many think to be found in the past. The backstory of loaded phrases can help us understand how we found ourselves facing these problems today – and even, perhaps, how to stop them from detonating into violence once more • "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e0f6b11fe55c0936c363b0f101327738549a8d1/511_0_5031_3019/master/5031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3600d05045321baf53bdc4df5716208","title":"lawrence wright god save texas journey future america interview looming tower 911","story":"Lawrence Wright is a staff writer at the New Yorker and the author of 11 books, the latest of which is God Save Texas: A Journey Into the Future of America (Allen Lane, £20), an episodic guide to the author’s home state. His book The Looming Tower, about the deep background of the 911 attacks, won the Pulitzer prize and was recently turned into a 10-part TV drama.Do you think Texas suffers from an image unrepresentative of the reality?It represents some part of the reality, but it’s certainly a stereotype so deeply ingrained throughout the world that it’s difficult to escape. It’s a kind of brand. It is an asset in many ways in that everyone knows or thinks they know something about Texas, so before they even meet you they already have an opinion based on where you’re from. Sometimes that’s an awful liability. Liberals tend to look at Texas with a kind of dread. They see it as the heartland of Daddy Warbucks capitalism. Conservatives view Texas as the promised land of small government and independent entrepreneurs. And both of those things are true in their way, but not so true that they encompass the real state of Texas.When you meet your New Yorker colleagues, do they share those preconceptions about Texas?The whole reason I wrote this book is because my editor at the New Yorker asked me to explain Texas because he can’t understand why I live here. And you know I’ve wondered about it myself. I’m very fond of Texas. I’ve got a lot of criticisms of some of its political stances and the direction it tends to be heading in, but I’m a product of this state and it’s hard to escape\u0026nbspthat.Was there something about Texas you learned in the course of researching this book that surprised you?Yeah, even though I’ve been a Texan for most of my life I knew almost nothing about the oil business. It’s a very complicated factor in the state because liberals have been very critical of the energy business unless it happens to be solar or wind, but the truth is we depend on cheap and reliable energy and Texas is one of the major suppliers. What happened in the 90s was the discovery of fracking and it has totally changed the geopolitical balance. As a person who’s written considerably about terrorism, I don’t mind seeing the resources of some of the countries that have been financial supporters of al-Qaida and other organisations diminished in that way. It made me appreciate the ingenuity of the oil industry.You write about two Texases, what you call AM and FM, rural and city, reactionary and progressive. Do they represent a widening gap in the US as a whole?The political and cultural fissures in Texas are very much like those in the country at large. One can ide it into Trump versus anti-Trump, or city versus rural. Those isions are more pronounced in Texas, and certainly Texas has contributed to the ision. A lot of the political movements that start in\u0026nbspTexas tend to move into the national discourse. The demographics are not really reflected in the political delegation we have. People outside look at our politicians and think that’s Texas. It doesn’t represent the complexity of the state.You write about the Kennedy assassination and the shadow it cast over Dallas. How much do you think that event influenced the conspiratorial thinking that we’ve seen since 911?I don’t know that it affected the “911 truthers”, but it certainly created a pattern of wilful denial of the factual evidence in favour of a worldview that conspiracy thinkers have. If the facts don’t comport with\u0026nbspyour view of the world then you\u0026nbspdisregard them or\u0026nbspmanufacture\u0026nbspnew factoids.I’ve written a lot about religious\u0026nbspcults and why people believe things\u0026nbspthat have no evidence\u0026nbspand I see conspiracy thinkers as being very similar in their mentality to people who are in cults.You’ve written many investigatory books. Is this more leisurely and reflective account of Texas a departure for you?Yes, I think it is in many respects. I once wrote a memoir about growing up in Texas during the Kennedy assassination. As a journalist I was trained not to use the first-person pronoun. So when I wrote that book it was a very charged experience for me. There’s still an alert that goes on in my mind when I’m writing about myself. I always like to have a character in my books who can represent the story to the reader and in this case the character was me.What do you think of the TV adaptation of The Looming Tower?I’m pleased with it. I had a number of different overtures from people about adapting it into a TV show or a movie and I was very cautious because 911 is a kind of hallowed event in America and I was afraid there would be a sense of exploitation of the tragedy, and also that it would cheapen the work that I had done. So it became clear that someone was going to do it, using my research without my permission, and I thought I had better get in front of this train. Alex Gibney the documentary film-maker was a reliable ally. We went out to Hollywood and pitched it. Our pitch was a series of demands – that we be in control of the project, that they not back down from legal threats and that they actually make it. Hulu put a lot of money into it – it was shot in eight countries – and you can see the results on the screen. Television is a far more nuanced and commodious medium than it was when the book came out.What books are on your beside table at the moment?I always dip into Robert Caro’s magisterial four-volume – soon to be five – biography of Lyndon Johnson. I was determined that I’d go through the whole thing and I’m midway through the third volume. I’m really impressed again and again by his ability to construct scenes and flesh out nuance. He’s one of the greatest biographers ever. I’m reading Peter Baker’s book Days of Fire about Bush and Cheney after 911. And I just read on the plane Admiral William McRaven’s Make Your Bed. He was the head of the special ops team that killed Bin Laden, and he’s a neighbour of mine. It’s an inspirational book about the things he learned from life in the navy Seals. I found it very moving in a way.Which writers, nonfiction and fiction, do you admire?I don’t read much fiction because I’m always doing research. I’m a fan of George Saunders, he’s an extraordinary writer. It took me five years to write The Looming Tower and I didn’t read a single novel during that time. When I finally did it was Ian McEwan’s Atonement, which I adore. I have tremendous admiration for my colleagues at the New Yorker. There’s a young woman, Alexis Okeowo, who’s written a book\u0026nbspabout ordinary Africans confronting terrorism. It’s really remarkable.What’s the best book you’ve received as a present?My wife gave me a book about roses. I love gardening. I’m an amateur rosarian. In terms of books I spend a lot of time looking at, that’s certainly high on my list.Which book would you give to a young person?When I was that age there were books that I found transformative and steered me towards wanting to become a writer myself. Saul Bellow’s Henderson the Rain King, Günter Grass’s The Tin Drum, and AJ Liebling’s The Earl of Louisiana, a wonderful book about Earl Long, a governor of Louisiana. It was hysterical. I often look at that. George Orwell is a kind of lodestar for me. I often dip into his collected essays when I’m trying to get my motor started. If a young writer were looking for a beacon, then I would say Orwell.To order God Save Texas: A Journey Into the Future of America by Lawrence Wright for £17 go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330\u0026nbsp333 6846.

The taste made her giddy. It made her want to laugh. Matteo ate whole sausages in a single mouthful. Sophie took four and made them into sandwiches with the venison. She added a slop of soup as a relish, and they ate them with both hands. Sophie’s hair blew in her mouth, and she tied it back with one of Matteo’s bow-strings. She couldn’t remember having been so happy before.Rooftoppers has been on my to-read list for a long time. I’ve heard only brilliant things, and since finishing Lucy Mangan’s gorgeous Bookworm, a memoir of childhood reading, I’ve been on the hunt for some truly great children’s books. Katherine Rundell’s second novel is a joy I already have a list of friends’ children I want to pass it on to once they’re old enough to appreciate it. As a particularly unadventurous child, I lived vicariously through the adventures of my favourite fictional characters. I wish Rooftoppers had been around when I was a child Sophie is exactly the type of heroine I would have happily admired from the safety and security of the bottom bunk.This rooftop picnic, shared between Sophie, a (not quite) orphan who has grown up in London, and Matteo, who has made a home on the rooftops of Paris, is one of the most evocative and mouth-watering descriptions of a meal I have come across in a long time. The food is carefully wrapped up in greaseproof paper by Sophie’s guardian, and taken by her to Matteo’s rooftop. He is waiting there, having found a crate of tomatoes, which they turn into a soup. Then he and Sophie unwrap pleasure after pleasure: warm rolls filled with butter, a whole sticky chocolate cake and a pot of cream, and a parcel of sausages, which they stick onto antennae and cook over a fire.The sticky chocolate cake and pot of cream will have to wait: I wanted to make soft, pillowy rolls, tomato relish, and a pile of sausages. I invited a couple of the younger neighbours round, and we ate the feast with our hands at the kitchen table. I’ve already promised to drop a copy of the book round.Enough for six children1 tin chopped tomatoesPinch salt and grinding of black pepper1tsp dark brown sugar1tsp red wine vinegarEquipmentMixer, if you have one, or a large mixing bowlJugTea towelRoasting dishGreaseproof paperSmall saucepanWooden spoonFrying panTongs1.

It’s ready when a small piece can be rolled into a ball without sticking to your fingers.(A note here: If I had access to a mixer with a dough hook, I absolutely would have turned it on for this. Kneading it by hand is fine, and you will get there, but it’s a damp dough, and it stuck to everything in my kitchen.)2. Wash up your mixing bowl, and grease with a little vegetable oil. Put the dough in the bowl, cover, and leave in a warm place for about an hour, until it doubles in size.3. Once your dough bounces back when prodded, tip it out onto your work surface. Weigh the dough, and ide the weight by 12. You should be able to shape 12 balls that are between 75 and 80g each. Pull off clumps of dough and weigh them, before shaping them into balls by pulling the dough tight and gathering it at the bottom. Roll against the work surface under your hand until they are tight and spherical. You can ide up the dough by eye, but the buns will cook more evenly if they’re all the same size.4. Line a roasting tray or baking dish with greaseproof paper. Place the buns into it, about one centimeter apart. Cover with a tea towel and allow them to double in size again they should need about 45 minutes. Preheat your oven to 200C.5. While they rise, make the tomato relish. Bring the tomato to a simmer in a small saucepan. Season with the sugar, salt, vinegar and pepper. Allow it to reduce over a low heat until thick and spreadable.6. Transfer the risen buns to the oven. Bake for 15-18 minutes, until golden brown on top. Cook the sausages in a frying pan, and keep warm until the bread is baked. Take the rolls out of the oven. Spread the tops with melted butter. Serve with the relish and sausages while the bread is still warm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f1541e3b7c9b87ba8ab6bf5f0f897c17021c962/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f29144b49e07cec036df06979adea5","title":"aviation agencies order engine checks after southwest blast","story":"US and European regulators order inspections within 20 days after passenger killed by blowoutUS and European airline regulators have ordered emergency inspections within 20 days of nearly 700 aircraft engines similar to the one involved in a fatal Southwest Airlines blowout earlier this week, citing risks of a similar mishap. The directives from the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency indicated rising concerns since a similar failure in 2016 of the same type of engine – a CFM56-7B engine, made by CFM International.The FAA said the engine on Southwest Airlines flight 1380 exploded on Tuesday when a fan blade broke off. The blast shattered a window, killing one woman, in the first US passenger airline fatality since 2009. “The unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design,” the FAA said in the order.CFM, which is jointly owned by General Electric and France’s Safran, produces the CFM56 engine in factories in the US and Europe. About 14,000 CFM56-7B engines are in operation.In August 2016 a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. Following that problem the European agency gave airlines nine months to check engines, while US regulators drafted an order giving airlines up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalised the measure by the time of Tuesday’s damage. The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, saying the data did not justify it.Airlines must now make ultrasonic inspections of fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or have been in service for about 20 years, within the next 20 days. A cycle includes one take-off and landing. The order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the US, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday had done 40,000 cycles, the company said.The CFM56 engine is used on about 1,800 Boeing 737 planes in service in the US and about 6,400 worldwide.  On Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board chairman, Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of US aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.Several major airline officials said the order would primarily affect airlines with higher use of aircraft covering shorter routes. Southwest, which had opposed efforts by CFM last year to shorten the FAA’s proposed 18-month deadline, said on Friday that its maintenance programme met or exceeded the new requirements.The European order states that after the first inspection, airlines must repeat the process every 3,000 cycles, which typically represents about two years in service. More than 150 have already been inspected.Inspections recommended by the end of August will affect an additional 2,500 engines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/771fe2c500a0891cc5d9bfc19f5395e272681682/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53df916bfe31f90f95d8d48e6806f50e","title":"media experts without expertise","story":"On-air ‘experts’ are more disconnected from their demographics than ever – and their lack of expertise has become glaring in the age of TrumpThe strong ratings of the first episode of the revived Roseanne set off an avalanche of commentary. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe, for instance, John Podhoretz, a columnist for the New York Post, called the show’s success a “wakeup call for Hollywood.” Given how well it had done in Middle America, he said, the lesson was clear: for those who serve underserved Donald Trump voters, there are “riches to be reaped.”Anand Giridharadas, a Brooklyn-based writer and MSNBC analyst, saw a broader truth: “Working-class white people may claim to be against identity politics, but they actually crave identity politics.” They want to be “seen and witnessed” in the same way that women and people of color do. With its glimpses of Maxwell House coffee and kitchen towels stitched with football logos, the show made an effort to pay respect to the details “of a certain demographic’s life.” But, Giridharadas added: “I hope these people realize other people want to be respected.” He hoped as well that it was not only demagogues like Donald Trump or conspiracy theorists like Roseanne who can speak to these people but also “smart, thoughtful, future-oriented political leaders” who could “elevate them” to “a better place instead of making them hate people and try to shut down the postwar global order.”On and on the discussion went. Jim Messina, a political consultant who worked in the Obama White House, cautioned against getting too excited, for the cities in which Roseanne did well included very blue Chicago. “We’re in an age of microcasting, and she did really well with her demographic, but it doesn’t mean we’re suddenly talking about political genius.” Donny Deutsch, an ad executive, agreed that the show’s success wasn’t all that surprising, since the “demo” that watches broadcast television is “more red state, lower income, lower education” when a program is aired that appeals to that group, the numbers will always be higher. According to journalist John Heilemann, the viewers of network TV make up “a shrinking audience that’s increasingly confined to a certain demographic.”Overall, the conversation, with its references to “a certain demographic” and “these people,” had a strangely disembodied and abstract air, as if describing the exotic inhabitants of a remote land. And in a way that was the case. Most of the discussants live and work in the Acela corridor, removed both geographically and materially from the lives of those on whom they were so confidently pronouncing. Tellingly, no one from the demographic in question was present to comment.The Morning Joe crew, in turn, is part of another demographic that has become prominent in the world of the media, the academy, think tanks, and consultants: experts without expertise. Its members expound on gun culture without knowing anyone who actually owns one opine on evangelical America without knowing any evangelicals assess the impact of free trade without having met anyone whose job has moved to Mexico. And their lack of expertise has become all the more glaring in the age of Trump.Take the field of history. Last April, Rick Perlstein, a prominent chronicler of modern American conservatism, offered a remarkable apologia in the pages of the New York Times Magazine. Until 8 November 2016, he wrote, historians of American politics “shared a rough consensus” about the rise of modern conservatism. Year zero was 1955, when William F Buckley Jr started National Review. Excommunicating John Birchers, antisemites, and supporters of Ayn Rand’s hyper-inidualism, Buckley forged the erse strands of conservative thinking into a coherent ideology that eventually came to dominate American politics. Perlstein acknowledged that he himself had helped forge this narrative. Then along came Donald Trump, and conservative intellectuals quickly embraced a man “who exploited the same brutish energies that Buckley had supposedly banished.”In short, “the professional guardians of America’s past” had “made a mistake,” advancing a sanitized narrative of the American right in which the “bloodcurdling” aspects of the conservative tradition were played down. The main reason, Perlstein wrote, is that “historians of conservatism, like historians in general, tend to be liberal, and are prone to liberalism’s traditions of politesse.” In the future, historians of conservatism would have to recover the darker parts of its tradition – its “political surrealists and intellectual embarrassments, its con artists and tribunes of white rage.” It “will not be a pleasant story,” but “if these historians are to construct new arguments to make sense of Trump, the first step may be to risk being impolite.”But is politeness really the problem? In his analysis, Perlstein did not mention the economic anxiety and social dislocation that helped feed the populist anger that contributed to Trump’s victory. I fear that Perlstein – contrite over his part in laundering the conservative past – is now veering in the opposite direction and fastening on its dirtiest elements. The real problem, I think, is that most of those historians constructed their narratives from within the confines of their studies, remote from on-the-ground realities.Urbanists have faced a similar reckoning. In 2002, Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto, came out with The Rise of the Creative Class. The creative class consisted of writers, designers, financiers, academics, artists, musicians, technology workers, and entrepreneurs, who, congregating in cities, turned them into “hothouses of innovation.” The resulting surge in growth, Florida maintained, benefited not only the third of the population that qualifies as creative (ie making a living with their brains) but also the remaining blue-collar and service workers (who rely on their bodies). A bestseller, Florida’s book had a huge influence on urban planners not only in America but throughout the world, prompting them to devise policies to attract the skilled and hip. Florida devised a bohemian index, a gay index, and a ersity index to rank cities according to the percentage of creative people living in them. While noting the possible downsides of the influx of talent, such as rising housing prices and gentrification, he treated them as incidental to the new industries and jobs boom that would result.It hasn’t quite worked out that way. While some big cities have thrived, the accompanying problems – soaring real estate prices, widening income gaps, the disappearance of middle-class neighborhoods – have made them playpens of the rich. And the idea that creative types want to live only in dense cities has proved inaccurate. Last year, Jed Kolko, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, drew on 2016 Census Bureau population estimates for counties and US Postal Service estimates of occupied housing units to calculate the average density of tracts from 2010 to 2016. From this, he concluded that the much-publicized return to the cities is mostly an urban legend. “Contrary to perception,” he wrote in a New York Times column, “the nation is continuing to become more suburban, and at an accelerating pace. The prevailing pattern is growing out, not up,” though with some exceptions.As Kolko observed, urban planners tend to live in the handful of metropolitan areas that are becoming more dense. “Those who write about, advocate for and choose to live in cities really do see more urbanization around them. But their cities are the exceptions.” In other words, urbanists like Florida may have been unduly influenced by their surroundings. Florida himself, citing Kolko’s findings, wrote a piece for the Times stating that “the urban revival is over” (as the headline put it). “The much ballyhooed new age of the city might be giving way to a great urban stall-out,” he wrote (without acknowledging that he himself had helped lead the ballyhooing). “Despite the hype” about innovations “intended to cram more people into less space,” he wrote, “many Americans still want space. They want to live in detached suburban homes, or in an apartment with enough square footage and access to outdoor space that it feels like one.” In his earlier writings, Florida largely overlooked those many Americans.On top of it all, Florida, living amid other incubating types, seemed oblivious to how inherently elitist the idea of a “creative class” is and how policies based on it were bound to cause resentment among the less gifted. In an article last year for Politico, he described how on election night 2016 he and his wife hosted a viewing party in his Toronto home and how crushed he was by Trump’s victory. Call it the revenge of the non-creative.As the cases of both historians and urban planners show, specialists founder when they are cut off from the broader population. Spending too much time among their own, they become isolated from alternative perspectives that can both test their preconceptions and broaden their outlooks.The problem, however, is not limited to geographic separation. Last October, Harper’s ran dispatches from 13 writers on “local politics in the age of Trump.” Among them was Marilynne Robinson, reporting from Iowa City, Iowa, where she has long been based. Robinson spent much of her piece lambasting the Republicans who run the state. As in the country as a whole, she wrote, the Republican governor and the Republican-controlled legislature create “problems where they need not exist.” Given the party’s current nature, she went on, it could surprise no one that “Republican domination has produced the kind of lawmaking that brands itself as populist and foregrounds supposedly populist reforms” – fireworks for all, guns everywhere, bans on cities and counties seeking to raise the minimum wage. Such policies were “consistent with the agenda of a national movement” heavily influenced by “outside money” and “strikingly at odds with the situation in Iowa.” Those policies “reflect an ideology” rather than “any engagement with the state itself” or “the particulars of its life or culture.”I was especially disappointed that she did not consider the role of religion in the state. Robinson is a committed Congregationalist and Calvinist who has written extensively about Christianity in America. Iowa has a large evangelical population. What is the connection between their beliefs and the state’s rightward turn? Given that evangelicals constitute one of Trump’s main bases, what is it that attracts them to him? Answering such questions requires diligent in-the-field reporting, including in-depth conversations with people in the pews. Few of the experts writing about American evangelicalism, however, bother to talk with them.On Morning Joe, the support of evangelicals for Trump is a perennial topic of conversation and a source of exasperation. “How can evangelicals support Trump?” Joe Scarborough asked one day last fall after yet another Trump travesty. Willie Geist, his sidekick, said something about protecting religious liberty. “But how do they continue to support him now?” Scarborough persisted. “I don’t know,” Geist said with a shrug, refreshingly acknowledging the limits of his expertise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9717e034360059f7248c0ac2828f8408c971b0f6/0_0_2892_1818/master/2892.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70c359dadbfecbe81e143c512fecd4c0 1400w","title":"macclesfield town promoted back to the football league","story":"Wolves were confirmed as champions after a 4-0 romp at relegation-threatened Bolton.

City had led 4-2 after Bobby Reid’s goal, only for strikes from Harry Wilson, Abel Hernandez and Fraizer Campbell put Hull into an unlikely lead. It took Joe Bryan’s equaliser in the 94th minute to take a point for Lee Johnson’s team, though failing to win left them three points shy of a play-off place.Aston Villa kept alive their slim hopes of automatic promotion with a 4-0 win at manager-less Ipswich with goals from Conor Hourihane, two from Lewis Grabban and Henri Lansbury defeating the ten-man Tractor Boys, who had Grant Ward dismised for a bad tackle on Neil Taylor. Middlesbrough meanwhile consolidated their play-off position with a 2-1 win at Derby, for whom defeat left them a point and a place outside the top six. Muhamed Besic, on loan from Everton, scored his first goal in English football and Britt Assombalonga scored a second. David Nugent’s injury-time penalty came far too late for Derby.Wigan’s promotion to the Championship was sealed by a 4-0 win at Fleetwood Town and Shrewsbury being held by already relegated Bury.Incoming Fleetwood manager Joey Barton was watching from the Highbury stands and saw Paul Cook’s men cruise to victory. Goals from Max Power, Gavin Massey, Dan Burn and Chey Dunkley got the celebrations underway.An equaliser from Bury’s Jay O’Shea meant Shrewsbury, now seven points behind second-placed Blackburn, cannot catch Wigan, now ten points clear of them.

Second-bottom MK Dons’ 4-0 defeat to Southend left them six points behind 20th placed OldhamLuton’s promotion to League One was confirmed after their 1-1 draw at Carlisle.

A fourth-minute goal from striker Tyrone Marsh after a cross from David Fitzpatrick was followed by a close-range finish from Mitch Hancox on the hour. Victory in Saturday’s early kick-off put automatic promotion beyond chasers Tranmere Rovers, who must now negotiate the play-offs.At the bottom of League Two, Chesterfield are all but relegated, needing to make up a goal difference of 19 goals in their last three matches on third-bottom Morecambe to survive.

Winners of this competition under Louis van Gaal in 2016, and of the Europa League and League Cups under José Mourinho last year, they secured a place in another final after condemning Tottenham and their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, to yet another campaign without a crowning achievement.Given their history both in this competition and in others Tottenham came into the game with not so much a monkey on their back as an entire posse of primates. A run of FA Cup semi-final failures now extended to eight, no significant trophies for a decade and just the two League Cups since they last snuck into the final and won this title against Nottingham Forest in 1991 represent a lengthy period if not quite in the wilderness then at least in a chilly hinterland.But in a heated atmosphere it was Spurs who warmed up most swiftly, Harry Kane having their first shot within 30 seconds, and Son Heung-Min’s clever turn putting the United defence in real trouble for the first time in the second minute. From the start United struggled to cope with the pace and intensity of their game, and when they found a path back into the contest it was only after Tottenham had themselves pointed the way. Mousa Dembele, one of several key players who ultimately disappointed for Spurs, gave the ball away deep inside his own half, Paul Pogba and Alexis S√°nchez combined to impose brutal, beautiful punishment and from there the pattern of the game changed.David de Gea \u0026nbspDid not make one of his trademark -wonder saves but neither was he at fault for Tottenham’s goal after 11 minutes. A steady display 6Antonio Valencia\u0026nbspStruggled to tame Son and was -arguably\u0026nbsplucky not to be sent off for an ankle-high lunge on Alli in the first half 5Chris Smalling\u0026nbspTasked with keeping Harry Kane at bay and did a good job. Diligent as well as willing to throw himself in front of shots from the England striker 7Phil Jones\u0026nbspMade an excellent interception that -prevented Tottenham going 2-0 ahead and overall was an aggressive, -dedicated presence in central defence 7\u0026nbspAshley Young \u0026nbspWent missing in the build-up to Tottenham’s goal, allowing Eriksen the freedom of the left wing to deliver the telling cross, but otherwise fine 6\u0026nbspAnder Herrera\u0026nbspScored the winning goal with a first-time, sweeping finish and generally grew into the game after an unsteady start 7Nemanja Matic\u0026nbspA typically, unfussy display from the Serbian from the base of United’s -midfield. Kept Dembélé’s marauding runs to a minimum 7Paul Pogba\u0026nbspMade up for his lack of defensive work in the build-up to Tottenham’s goal with superb cross for United’s -equaliser. Generally performed well 7\u0026nbspJesse Lingard \u0026nbspPenetrative presence from the outset and made a subtle but important contribution to United’s winner, moving the ball on to Herrera 7Romelu Lukaku\u0026nbspWorked tirelessly and aggressively as United’s lone forward without causing Tottenham any problems. Mourinho will have been pleased with his effort 6Alexis Sánchez\u0026nbspSecured United’s equaliser with a -brilliantly-placed header – his fifth goal in five FA Cup games at Wembley – and played a role in the winner 7Having dominated the early exchanges Spurs took the lead with a goal of humiliating simplicity. Ashley Young committed himself to pressing the ball deep inside the Tottenham half and Davinson Sánchez hit it long into the space the United left-back should have been covering. It was space that Christian Eriksen had all to himself and with Paul Pogba trailing behind him he had time to measure his cross, which Dele Alli turned in.There could, in the minutes that followed, have been more. Son’s looping cross was just too long for Harry Kane, and his low cross seemed destined to be converted by Alli until Phil Jones hooked it clear. Kane set up Eriksen for a shot that bounced across goal and wide, and Son whose effort hit Antonio Valencia. Michel Vorm, who has kept goal for Spurs throughout their Cup run, had been woefully underemployed until Trippier, with the ball on the right flank, turned down the chance to clear and instead passed to Mousa Dembele, who might have turned the ball into touch but instead tried to jink past Pogba and failed. From there the Frenchman spun and delivered a delicious centre that dipped on to Alexis Sánchez’s head and from there into goal.That moment gave United the encouragement to match their rivals’ intensity and the remainder of the first half was considerably more even, ending with fine long-range shots from both sides, Pogba’s curler in the final minute being tipped past the post, and Eric Dier’s drive in stoppage time deflecting off Chris Smalling and thumping the base of David de Gea’s right-hand post.Smalling also got himself in the way of Tottenham’s first notable shot of the second half, deflecting Kane’s effort wide. That this took place nearly 14 minutes after the interval reflects a period of diminished pace and precision. But now it was United who were more often winning second balls and coming first in marginal races, and Spurs being pressured into errors. Ander Herrera epitomised their improved work ethic in scoring their second goal, sprinting the length of the field before arriving on the edge of Tottenham’s penalty area with perfect timing. Sánchez’s pass from the left flicked off Lukaku’s studs, was left by Lingard, and the Spaniard’s low drive flashed past Vorm.Having survived their poor start, United flourished to eventually give a display of intensity and authority. Pogba impressed again, claiming an assist and hitting a couple of delicious long passes to Romelu Lukaku S√°nchez displayed the effervescence that marked his finer performances for Arsenal. Spurs, increasingly frustrated, played at times as if their primary target was not United’s goal but Lingard’s ankles. With Kane peripheral for long periods there was only one significant chance as they chased the game, when Victor Wanyama headed Erik Lamela’s free-kick harmlessly high in the 89th minute.Instead United, having taken an almost comical amount of time over a couple of substitutions, might have extended their advantage in the resulting stoppage time. First Lukaku released Marcus Rashford only for Eric Dier to eventually dispossess him inside the penalty area, and then Vorm raced out to block a pass to Lukaku, with his back rather than, as many United fans suspected, his hands. But if this victory was never destined to be comfortable, it was in the end convincing.Michel Vorm \u0026nbspMaintained his status as Tottenham’s FA Cup goalkeeper and, bar a shaky kick early on, was generally fine. Could not do much about the goals 6Kieran Trippier\u0026nbsp Misplaced a pass that contributed to United’s first goal and could have done more to stop Sánchez in the build-up to their second. Not at his best 5Davinson Sánchez One of six changes Mauricio Pochettino made to his team, coming in for Toby Alderweireld, and was generally assured at the heart of the Spurs defence 6Jan Vertonghen\u0026nbspAs assured as his centre-back partner, although he was arguably was caught a little flat-footed for United’s opening goal\u0026nbsp6Ben Davies \u0026nbspCould have done more to prevent Herrera’s goal given the ball went through his legs before ending up in the back of the net. Otherwise competent enough\u0026nbsp6Eric Dier\u0026nbspStruck the post with a low drive in the first-half and was generally steady. But, overall, failed to impose himself. Booked late on\u0026nbsp6Mousa Dembélé \u0026nbspWas easily outmuscled by Pogba in the build-up to United’s equaliser.

There should be no sense of Wearside injustice. Not at the end of a season when Sunderland’s descent into the third tier for only the second time in their history has long felt inevitable.“I want to apologise to the supporters for coming up short,” said the Sunderland manager Coleman, who has never spoken to Short and is praying for a summer takeover which might persuade him to stay on. “Maybe my optimism was blind. We haven’t been good enough. I can’t tell you what my future is because I don’t know.”In principle, the man who led Wales to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 wants to put things right but will not continue to work with at least one hand tied behind his back. “I know what I want to do, I know what needs to be done but changes must be made,” he said. “It depends on Ellis.”If Nigel Clough’s Burton side are to defy the odds and somehow survive they must beat Bolton at home next week, then win at Preston while hoping other results go their way. “We’ve kept it going for another week,” said Burton’s manager whose introduction of Bent, once Sunderland’s star striker, changed the afternoon’s entire narrative. “That’s all we can do. “The sight of a Clough in the technical area reminded fans of a certain generation of the days when his father, Brian, scored 63 goals in 74 games for Sunderland before ripped knee ligaments brought his playing career to a cruelly abrupt end. “My father used to talk with such passion about this club,” said the locally born Nigel. “It’s unbelievable that we’ve relegated them.”Early, horribly misplaced passes from Lee Cattermole and Paddy McNair emphasised both how things on Wearside have sunk to this nadir and the tension paralysing a home team which has won only two league games here all season.McNair though has generally proved a positive influence since returning from a serious knee injury and offered Coleman ultimately false 34th-minute hope by scoring his third goal in three games. When Ashley Fletcher did unusually well to remain on his feet under pressure and cue the former Manchester United midfielder up, McNair’s resultant shot, from just outside the area, speared beneath Stephen Bywater.Refusing to surrender, Clough pressed every available tactical button and Sunderland goalkeeper Jason Steele did extremely well to repel Jacob Davenport’s left foot shot. On came Bent, never forgiven here for forcing through a move to Aston Villa. “Only one greedy bastard,” chorused a previously flat, suddenly loud and animated, 25,000-plus crowd as the former England striker stepped off Burton’s bench.Although Steele performed wonders to parry Hope Akpan’s shot, Bent sneaked in front of substitute Jake Clarke-Salter to nod the rebound home in the 86th minute before Boyce met Ben Turner’s cross to head the stoppage-time winner.The drama was not quite over, Sunderland having that late ‘equaliser” ruled out when McNair seemed to have scored from a corner. After initially appearing to give the “goal” Darren England, the referee, changed his mind following consultations with officials. “The last 60 seconds was a mess,” said Coleman. “But one crazy decision hasn’t relegated us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e0f42a21b5ecc7c198d5efc09676bb48055f635/0_91_4024_2414/master/4024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42b484fdcab2dab61a0825bb5aa7a7c2","title":"watford crystal palace premier league match report","story":"Wilfried Zaha must be wondering what it is about this stadium. The last time he was here, in December 2016, the Crystal Palace forward reacted angrily when he was accused of ing by the Watford mascot, Harry the Hornet, after winning a penalty for his side.Nearly 18 months on, Zaha once more found himself embroiled in controversy after three incidents that – depending on your opinion – could have ended with him being shown a red card or awarded two penalties.In the end, the hard-earned point that pushes his side a step closer to safety will provide some solace for the Ivory Coast international on a day when he ran the opposition defence ragged at times.Watford’s traditional poor springtime form meant they had gone five matches without a victory, conceding 15 goals in the process, so the decision to pair the Italy international Stefano Okaka in attack with Troy Deeney was a brave one with the former chairman Elton John, watching on from the stands. Yet it almost paid off as early as the fourth minute when Deeney found space on the right and his cross was headed against the crossbar by Okaka.Prompted by the dominance of the excellent Abdoulaye Doucouré in midfield, the strike duo continued to cause Palace’s defence problems throughout the first half, with Joel Ward lucky to escape as Deeney’s cross-shot cannoned off him and into the arms of Wayne Hennessey.In contrast, Palace struggled to create any forward momentum as the makeshift strikers, Zaha and Andros Townsend, found space limited with their backs to goal. A header by James Tomkins from Townsend’s free-kick that was easy saved by Orestis Karnezis was the best they could muster.The half’s moment of controversy was saved for just before the break when Zaha went down in the box under a clumsy challenge from Christian Kabasele.Doucouré immediately rushed over to confront him and was lucky to escape a second booking for pushing the Palace forward in the chest having only just been cautioned for a tackle on Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Chris Kavanagh waved away Zaha’s appeals for a penalty but, significantly as it turned out, did not produce a card.Watford’s supporters were incensed and their mood did not improve after the break when Zaha escaped a caution for his late challenge on Karnezis.Palace’s talisman was back in the thick of the action when he was felled by Adrian Mariappa on the edge of the box and Luka Milivojevic’s free-kick struck the bar.Moments later the referee showed Zaha the yellow card after ruling he had ed under pressure from Mariappa and Will Hughes during a goalmouth scramble, delighting the home fans if not Roy Hodgson.“I try hard not to be the person who bellyaches but having seen it again, it was a pretty clear penalty decision,” he said. “Reputation is a dangerous thing. Who gives them the reputation? Where he has suffered is that other managers have given you their version of the story and branded him someone who es for penalties. Of course, the more it is written or spoken about, the more the legend will circulate. He is anything other than a cheat or a er. He is sometimes far too desperate to stay on his feet and score a goal himself.”To his credit, Javi Gracia refused to take the bait.“I didn’t see it – there were many players around him. There are many situations around Zaha because he has that style of play,” the Watford manager said. “It was a very, very difficult day for the referee.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0779d41aed56faf6d90c8cb5e93a60a682ae0d6e/322_0_3153_1891/master/3153.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dbfeb90c90299f5658edc9a4ec24e82","title":"west bromwich albion liverpool premier league match report","story":"It was not the script that Jürgen Klopp had in mind in advance of a critical week and the Liverpool manager was unable to conceal his anger and frustration afterwards as he described West Bromwich Albion’s comeback as useless in the context of their survival hopes and railed against the dry state of the pitch.Klopp’s complaints about Stuart Attwell’s poor refereeing were far more legitimate given that Liverpool were denied a clear penalty at the start of the second half and should have been playing against 10 men after Ahmed Hegazi punched Danny Ings in the stomach, yet it was his remarks about Albion’s predicament and the playing surface that caused a stir.In fairness to Klopp, he was honest enough to admit he would have said nothing about the pitch if Liverpool had won a game that was firmly within their grasp when Mohamed Salah registered his 31st league goal of the season – equalling the record for a 38-game season held by Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suárez – to double their lead 18 minutes from time.Albion, however, have been a totally different proposition since Darren Moore took over from Alan Pardew and they showed tremendous spirit to score from two set pieces in the last 12 minutes, through Jake Livermore and Salomón Rondón, to salvage a point and leave Klopp, whose team face Roma in the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday, bitterly upset.After claiming the pitch became “drier and drier, and it is not in favour or an advantage for the football-playing side”, Klopp lamented Attwell’s failure to point to the penalty spot after Ings was barged over by Craig Dawson and the way that Hegazi escaped punishment for his punch on the striker.“You see it, I see it, but that’s not important,” Klopp said. “It is only important what three or four gentleman with a whistle say. So we cannot change it. I think if you are the better team, you should win. We are the better team, we didn’t win.“I don’t feel that point will help West Brom massively. It feels like a complete waste of points they don’t need it. We would have needed it. They are all happy now, we are not happy. We stay in the league, they don’t stay in the league. It’s kind of a strange situation.Albion may well be heading for the Championship – they are eight points adrift of safety with three matches remaining – yet their supporters’ reaction at the final whistle suggested that they viewed the fifth point gained from three games under Moore as anything but futile.The home team were behind as early as the fourth minute, when Ings, whose introduction was one of five changes that Klopp made to his team, swept home from close range after Georginio Wijnaldum teed him up from Sadio Mané’s cross. It was Ings’s first goal since October 2015.Liverpool’s second was another of those trademark finishes from Salah, who coolly lifted the ball over Ben Foster after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had set him free.Albion, though, were far from finished. Livermore hooked home from six yards and then Liverpool pressed the self-destruct button. Joe Gomez carelessly gave away possession in the lead-up to the free-kick that Chris Brunt expertly delivered for Rondón to head in at the near post.Asked about the condition of the pitch, Moore said: “It wasn’t a ploy. It was a hot day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78d5a2f6ecf9d438123c526a3572a9da850037e/571_148_1857_1114/master/1857.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56723a422c904e6f62a9fdb58b44ad45","title":"arsene wenger arsenal martyr to his values exasperation affection","story":"It is a story that Arsène Wenger has told on more than one occasion in different company over dinner and it always has the desired effect. The Arsenal manager talks of a book he has read in which an assassin is able to stop his heart when he kills and then restart it. “I’m looking for a striker like that,” he says.What is not to like? It has Wenger, a trained killer, resurrection, death and football. As the Frenchman’s eyes twinkle, an acquaintance who has heard the punchline describes how his audiences are hooked. “Arsène has them eating out of his hand,” he says. “He is a magnificently charming companion.”Wenger is a bewitching raconteur when the mood takes him and as the Arsenal support – and the wider football world – pour out the sentimentality following the announcement that he is to leave his post of almost 22 years at the end of the season, it is his ability to connect on a human level that ought to be celebrated.There have been several well‑documented phases of Wenger at Arsenal but the constants have been his front-of-house grace – even when under intolerable pressure – and behind-the-scenes encouragement.“Beyond football, he’s inspired the people around him,” Ivan Gazidis, the club’s chief executive, says. “He does this through his human qualities his understanding and his empathy for people. He’s able to make them believe that they can achieve great things, on and beyond the pitch. He inspired George Weah to believe not only that he could become the world’s greatest footballer but to have the conviction that he could become the president of a country.”It has been an education and a privilege for many journalists to document Wenger’s career and all of us have experienced the moment when he smiles and calmly explains why he is right and everybody else is wrong – often in the face of challenging odds.There have been numerous occasions when the tape been replayed and holes picked in various strands of his argument. But here’s the thing. At the time, you believe him. It all makes sense. It is easy listening, perfectly erting.Wenger is at his most engaging when tackling weighty issues – which are not always about football. “Why don’t we just talk about politics, that would be more interesting?” he once said. Regrettably, it did not happen. The imperatives of the day held sway.Much is made of Wenger’s economics qualification but he is as much a psychologist and a sociologist. When he starts a sentence by saying: “We live in a society of … ” - it is invariably the cue for thought-provoking observation. He has talked of a society of opinions, of instant judgments, of an obsession with the next big thing. And so much more.“The most important thing is to believe in human beings,” Wenger said last Christmas. “When you are such a long time in the job, you’re not naive. You know all the strengths and weaknesses and how, sometimes, people can be selfish or mean. But you still have to believe that there is a light in every human being that you can get out. The ultimate goal is to make people happy. Unfortunately, you don’t always manage that but you try to do it.”Win 2-0 against Blackburn in Wenger’s first match in chargeDefeat Everton 4-0 to win Premier League titleBeat Newcastle 2-0 to lift FA Cup and complete the doubleWenger offers to replay Sheffield United following controversial FA Cup winLost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray in Uefa Cup finalWin 1-0 at Old Trafford to win the league titleA 2-2 draw at rivals Spurs confirms third league title winBeat Leicester 2-1 to complete The Invincibles’ unbeaten seasonFinal game at HighburyDefeated 2-1 in Champions League final by BarcelonaLose 8-2 to Manchester United at Old TraffordMarks 1,000th game in charge by losing 6-0 at ChelseaWins record-breaking seventh FA Cup with victory over ChelseaDespite defeating Everton 3-1, they finish outside the top four for first time in Wenger eraAnnounces he will leave Arsenal at the end of the seasonMore than anything, it has been Wenger’s dignity in press conferences that has shone brightly, particularly in the final, more traumatic phase of his reign. It is possible to count on the fingers of one hand the number of times he has lost his composure and lashed out – and the provocation has been extreme. Wenger has been asked at regular intervals over the past five years, at least, whether the time might be right for him to stand down, with the interference being that the questioner thought he was no longer up to the job.Following one of the rare occasions when Wenger did lose it – before a Champions League game against Bayern Munich in February 2013, after being asked about his contract – a Manchester-based colleague remarked that there was no way journalists would have dared speak to Sir Alex Ferguson in similar fashion. Perhaps it is because Wenger does not have a confrontational bone in his body.Wenger’s relationship with the press has cooled to the point of freezing and most journalists feel the decline began when he stopped holding his newspaper briefing in a separate room. When he used to do that, the mood was invariably more relaxed and often light-hearted. The conversation would flow.There has always been a fascination to uncovering any detail on Wenger and in the more intimate environment he coughed up a few. Who would have guessed that he liked the singer Plastic Bertrand?Wenger is more than happy to discuss the issues of the day but he is notoriously guarded about his private life and personal feelings. As such, his admission that he thought the uncertainty over his future last season had affected the team was faintly shocking.Wenger has consciously maintained a distance between himself and the 21st-century British press, whom he views not as iniduals but as an amorphous mass. He never addresses journalists by name and he never goes off the record. The us-and-them feeling has become pronounced.As his tenure hit the buffers he has become increasingly introspective and evasive.Some of his briefings have been as short as five minutes, shaped at the outset by him taking a long and deliberate look at his watch. The twinkle in his eye has been missing, the answers predictable – both of which have felt symbolic.Yet Wenger retains the capacity to flick a switch and bring the room to life, to stir feelings of genuine fondness. When his departure was announced on Friday many Arsenal supporters were happy. It was what they had wanted. Yet why were they also upset?It is because, above all, Wenger is a gentleman, who has been a part of many people’s lives for so long. For Arsenal fans under the age of 30, he is the only manager they have really known – a strangely reassuring presence in an ever changing world, in spite of the frustrations he has caused them.A martyr to his values, Wenger will keep fighting until the final day. After all of the turmoil, there is the sense of appreciation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b384ab848b1e5c31d05f5ae1fa6ea47cca3a4ac9/0_15_5391_3235/master/5391.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b71243e66ad12d93ae6aec3a8cb1f7e0","title":"manchester united v tottenham hotspur fa cup semi final live","story":"Alexis Sanchez and Ander Herrera scored as United came from behind to deservedly win an excellent semi-final at WembleyHere’s Simon Burnton’s report from Wembley, which is my cue to drift off into the night. Thanks for your company and emails, bye!We’ll have a live match report from Wembley shortly. No more post-match interviews I’m afraid: the BBC coverage ended abruptly so that they can squeeze in Pointless Celebrities. I can MBM that if you like.Jose Mourinho is one game away from his third trophy in two seasons at United manager. It hasn’t been smooth but he sure knows how to win trophies, something he’ll remind everyone of in the build-up to the final. Prizes make points.It’s another to add to Spurs’ list of what-ifs. They started beautifully but faded after Sanchez’s equaliser. Harry Kane barely had a kick and Dele Alli was quiet apart from his goal. They are such a likeable side but they are running out of time to win a trophy before the time starts to break up. Ander Herrera “Really happy for the goal, for the victory. We are getting used to being in finals, which is good because that’s what this club is about. The centre-backs did an amazing job.Chris Smalling “We turn up in big games and I think we’ve shown that again.”That’s a huge result for United after a difficult week. Their star players, Pogba and Sanchez, were superb, and their much maligned defence controlled Spurs brilliantly in the second half. It was a really good game.Manchester United will play Chelsea or Southampton in the FA Cup final! They started wretchedly but fully deserved to win an excellent match. Spurs have now lost their last eight FA Cup semi-finals.90+6 min Marouane Fellaini replaces the man of the match Alexis Sanchez.90+5 min Pogba flips a long pass into space for Lukaku, who is just beaten to the ball 40 yards from goal by Vorm. At the other end Smalling holds off Kane to win a goalkick, and is almost chestbumped by Jones.90+4 min Nemanja Matic is down with cramp, so there’s another delay.90+3 min Alexis Sanchez looks an absolute state, which is a reflection of the obscene effort he has put in all game. He’s been brilliant.90+2 min Lukaku makes a great interception and sets Rashford clear, one against one with Dier. Rashford moves into the area, dummies to shoot but then loses the ball to Dier. He was a bit indecisive there, though it was good defending.90+1 min There will be five minutes of added soccer.90 min Herrera is booked for some foul or other. Spurs are running out of time. Lamela’s clip over the top is volleyed up in the air by the stretching Davinson Sanchez and De Gea makes a comfortable claim.89 min Lamela’s curling free-kick is headed over from six yards by Wanyama. It was just behind him and so he couldn’t steer it on target.88 min Vertonghen slips past Alexis Sanchez, who pulls him back. Free-kick to Spurs on the left wing...87 min Lucas Moura ks a desperate long-range shot well wide. United’s defence have been Spurs at arms length throughout the second half it’s been a seriously good performance.86 min Spurs make their last change, with Erik Lamela replacing Son.85 min Rashford is booked for ing. He hurdled Davinson Sanchez’s tackle and fell over as he landed. It’s hard to say for certain whether it was a e or whether the leap left him off balance. 84 min “I heard the opinion this week that Pogba is better with Herrera in the team,” says Adam Roberts. “It’s certainly true today they’ve both been great.”The balance looks so much better when they both play. That 4-3-3 should surely be the default formation next season.83 min Eriksen’s tame low shot from distance is easily saved by De Gea.83 min “My perception of practitioners of ‘the dark arts’ is entirely coloured by how creative the player is,” says Phil Podolsky. “ For someone like Deco, cheating was part of his credentials as Professor of Cunning at Oxford University, that also included being incredibly artful with the ball at his feet, so it’s qualitatively different from someone like Materazzi.”82 min Another United change: Marcus Rashford replaces Jesse Lingard, who has put in his usual shift.81 min United have controlled the game very well in the second half. There hasn’t been a lot between the teams but United have been just a bit better in all areas. Dier, meanwhile, is booked for plunging his studs into Lingard’s achilles.80 min United make their first change: Antonio Valencia, who has cramp, is replaced by Matteo Darmian.78 min Victor Wanyama replaces Mousa Dembele for Spurs.77 min Valencia, who has already been booked, fouls Alli on the left wing. Spurs ask for him to be sent off but Anthony Taylor doesn’t oblige. Valencia made it look clumsy, which probably saved him.76 min At the moment United look pretty comfortable. I can’t remember De Gea making a save since half-time.75 min Pogba’s stinging shot from 20 yards is palmed behind by the flying Vorm. I think it was going wide anyway but it was a good strike.73 min Eriksen, Spurs’ best player, hits a surprise left-footed shot from 25 yards that  just misses the far post and sends a water bottle flying behind the goal. De Gea was happy to let it go, which showed exceptional judgement of where his off stump was.72 min Pogba plays a lovely, subtle through pass to Lukaku, who charges from right to left and hits a rising shot from a tight angle that is comfortably patted down by Vorm. Pogba has had a superb game.72 min Ashley Young is booked for timewasting.71 min “Kane not looking remotely fit today!” says Nick Parmenter. “Almost like playing with 10 men.”70 min Spurs have moved Dier into the back four, with Vertonghen at left-back.69 min A challenge by Dembele on Alexis Sanchez leads to a full and frank exchange of views by the players on both sides. He put his arm across Sanchez’s face but I don’t think it was a deliberate elbow and there’s no card.68 min Spurs make their first change, with Lucas Moura replacing Ben Davies. 65 min Pogba angles a fine pass over the top to Lukaku, who is one against one with Vertonghen in the inside-right channel. He comes infield onto his left foot and drives a low shot just wide of the near post. Vorm had it covered.63 min I’m not sure about Vorm’s positioning on the goal but it was a really crisp connection from Herrera.United take the lead! Alexis Sanchez’s pass was miscontrolled by Lukaku on the edge of the area but fell nicely for Herrera, who charged onto the scene and whistled a low first-time shot under Vorm from 15 yards. That’s a nice finish.59 min After a slow start, the second half is warming up nicely.58 min Alli plays a sweet first-time pass through to Kane in the area. He works the ball onto his left foot and hits a shot that deflected behind off Smalling. Good defending.57 min Trippier lobs a good pass infield to Eriksen, who belts a superb cross that flashes across the face of goal.56 min Herrera’s sharp cutback finds Lingard, who mis-hits a first-time shot from 12 yards.

Thanks for reading. Here’s Louise Taylor’s on Sunderland’s disastrous day. Burton are still alive, though must hope Barnsley do not win their game in hand on Tuesday when the Tykes play Nottingham Forest. There is an FA Cup semi being played right now, and Tottenham, the home team, lead Manchester United 1-0 after a goal from Dele Alli. Rob Smyth is your guide. And it’s in there...Here’s Ed Aarons’ report from Vicarage Road.Sunderland’s Twitter feed still yet to admit the club will be in League One next season. News from the lower reaches, where it’s been a big day for the self-styled “Class of ‘92” (and Phil Neville). Salford City will play in the National League next season.As we wait for reports from Watford and Sunderland to come in, Richard McGahey emails in on the ref debate. “I don’t know if the tolerance for overly physical play and inconsistent standards is why English refs aren’t going to the World Cup. But the Premier League allows much more physical play, and English fans and commentators reflect this culture in their commentary and analysis--”oh, nothing much in that,” “no intent there,” let the lads play” while Lee Dixon and others on TV pine for the good old days of leg breaking. That’s why it was such a shock to see Michael Oliver calling fouls (inconsistently, of course) in the Juventus-Real Madrid match, and even issuing yellow cards, which he and other English refs don’t do nearly as much in the PL.”Matters across Europe rounded up here. And in all that hubbub, it’s best to round off matters at Bristol City which ended up 5 (five) - 5 (five) with Hull City. Joe Bryan grabbed the equaliser in the 94th minute. Football!The reason Sunderland are relegated is that Burton and Bolton play each other next week. That’s not the only reason of course, but that’s the maths. Sunderland’s Twitter feed still yet to admit the club have been relegated. Having won 4-0 at Bolton. Chesterfield need a 19-goal turnaround on Morecambe to stay up, so are all but down. Chesterfield lost 4-1 at Forest Green, but are not yet relegated after Morecambe lost. That’s now a question of mathematics. A 1-1 draw at Carlisle was enough for themAfter winning 4-0 at Fleetwood. It’s full-time and it’s finished 2-1 to Burton. Both teams edge to safety after a rather angry affair. Sunderland have just had a goal disallowed for handball. Anger at the Stadium of Light. A disaster for Sunderland, and it is Burton who have hope of survival, as Liam Boyce scores.Darren Bent almost won it for Burton, only to be denied by a great save from Jason Steele. Sunderland hit the bar after Ashley Fletcher’s header. It’s 5-4 to Hull at Bristol City! What a comeback. Fraizer Campbell grabbed it. Drama! And pain for Bristol City. Barnet are now leading 2-0 and can still escape the drop to the National League. Darren Bent scores against his old club and hopes of a great escape are extinguished. Another humdinger between Cambridge and Cheltenham, which is currently a 4-3 scoreline to the home team. 4-4 between Bristol City and Hull! Abel Hernandez has equalised. That could be a felling blow for City’s hopes of sidling into the play-offs. Forest Green lead Chesterfield 2-1 and that puts Chesterfield on the edge of their first time outside the Football League for almost 110 years.Luton, drawing 1-1 at Carlisle, are close to being promoted, but need Exeter’s 2-2 scoreline with Crawley to hold. Joseph Harvey has a view on the Zaha booking“Is it just me or has it been a terrible year in the EPL for referees? That Zaha penalty was a stone dead penalty. He got a yellow for ing. Could part of the problem be that the FA and the referee’s association in England want a game that just doesn’t resemble the rulebook anymore? The idea that a punch in the WBA match earlier is part of the game, that contact off the ball isn’t a penalty, and that there wasn’t enough contact (on a high boot in the box) for the penalty in case of Zaha, just isn’t consistent with the laws of the game. I can think of more than a dozen or so events like this across the year. It’s been weighing on my mind a lot since England won’t have any referees at the World Cup.”Isn’t England’s lack of referees down to Mark Clattenburg choosing to work in Saudi Arabia? And perhaps a lack of familiarity with VAR? It’s now AFC Wimbledon 2-2 Oldham. A tense afternoon down at the Cherry Red Stadium. Meanwhile, Burton are piling on the pressure against Sunderland, who are trying to hold on to their lifeline.Bristol City 4-3 Hull: What a game out west. Harry Wilson, on loan from Liverpool, has got Hull back into it. Watford are living dangerously against Crystal Palace, who have had a shot cleared off the line. But it’s still 0-0. Birmingham City lead Sheffield United 2-1, and with Bolton losing, this could be a big say for Blues. Middlesbrough lead Derby 2-0 after a goal from Britt Assombalonga.How wrong can you be? Bury have equalised at Shrewsbury through Jay O’Shea. And as it stands, Wigan, now leading 4-0, will be heading to the Championship. Wolves are 4-0 up and that is desperate news for Bolton. Captain Conor Coady slotted in from the penalty spot. Bristol City now lead Hull City 4-2. A humdinger at Ashton Gate. Penalty to Palace? No, Wilfried Zaha has been booked for ing.

The taste of our carrots, which two minutes before were in the ground, is incredible. We’re a co-op so my eggs and honey are distributed to people on the farm. Bee-keeping is like raising Martians.Italy is basically an agricultural country with a climate and culinary tradition to match. In Italy, hardly anyone goes to the supermarket for food.My mother had a collection of utensils hanging on the wall, most of them sadly lost now. You’d take them if needed. I had dinner recently with someone who also had forks, knifes and spoons which you’d bring to the table in a box for guests to take from. I use that as an example of Swedish frugality, practicality and elegance.As a girl I had scoliosis, a deformity of the spine. I had casts and stretching operations and it went on and on. It was very painful and had many complications. I always hoped to be home because the food in hospital was very heavy and not good. I was immobile for about a year and lost weight. I remember people saying, “Try to eat, try to eat.”When I was 24 I was doing commercials for Rabarbaro Grappa, an Italian liqueur made out of rhubarb. When Nixon opened up China the company received their rhubarb from there. I travelled to China as a model and found this amazing rhubarb which was like a tree, which they used the root of for that liqueur. I was photographed next to this Chinese rhubarb, an absolutely huge rhubarb which dies out every year and then grows again.When I was married to Martin Scorsese his mother cooked most of the food. She was a wonderful cook and stocked our refrigerator so we could have a week of food.Another man I know who has a real passion for food is Stanley Tucci. He co-directed and wrote this beautiful script about food and family for the film Big Night and I acted in it alongside him. But I think the script could have been about art, or farming, or bee-keeping or another field. Anything you love and want to keep pure. I always have a conflict about how commercial I want my organic farm to be.We have a group on several fields of my farm called the Long Island Native Plant Initiative, which works with Cornell University to collect Long Island plants, selecting seeds to help keep bioersity.You work less as an actress when you’re 45 or 50 and you don’t work at all as a model. I had a lot of time on my hands and so I went back and studied what I’ve always wanted to study – conservation and then animal behaviour. I’ve two exams to go for my Masters.

As a young cook, full of ideas – and of myself – things had to be done ‘properly’, even at home: tins were a no-no and the freezer a no-go fancy appliances were a last resort. Only pure, raw ingredients were acceptable, and every bit of prep had to be done by hand. How tedious. These days, I am far more forgiving. As long as the process is enjoyable and the food sustaining, I’m happy with any trick, any cheat, anything to put a delicious meal on the table.Pasta is a sacred thing and this method of cooking it in the sauce is certainly not common. My colleague Gitai Fisher, who might as well be Italian, went so far as to say that it’s not just cheating, it’s blasphemy. For the sauce, I’ve added North African touches to Italian puttanesca. Gitai was of the opinion that this, too, was cheating.

Transfer a third of the chickpeas to a small bowl, to use as a garnish.In a second bowl, combine the parsley, lemon zest, capers and olives, then add two-thirds of this mix to the saute pan with the cherry tomatoes, sugar and caraway seeds, and cook for two minutes more, stirring often.Add the pasta, stock and 200ml water, and bring up to a simmer. Turn the heat to medium, cover with a lid and leave to cook, undisturbed, for 12-14 minutes, until the pasta is al dente.Stir in the remaining parsley mixture, drizzle with the remaining two tablespoons of oil, and garnish with the fried chickpeas and a good grind of pepper.This uses frozen seafood and spinach to save time and effort. The former varies from brand to brand: most contain a base of fish, squid and prawns, and some will also feature mussels andor scallops. Any will do the job here. If the seafood mix is pre-cooked, there’s no need to heat it in the milk first just add it to the base with the other ingredients.1 celeriac, peeled and halved (600g net)2½ tbsp olive oil30g parmesan, finely gratedSalt and black pepper750ml whole milk⅛ tsp ground nutmeg600g frozen raw seafood mix, defrosted (ie, 1-2 packets)75g unsalted butter2 leeks, trimmed, cut in half lengthways, then into 1cm pieces3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed½ tsp dried chilli flakes50g plain flour100ml dry white wine250g frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and squeezed dry15g each dill, parsley and tarragon leaves, all roughly chopped15g chives, cut into 1cm lengths2 tbsp capers, roughly chopped1 tbsp lemon zest¼ tsp paprikaHeat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. Cut one celeriac half into 2cm x 2cm cubes and put in a bowl cut the other into 2mm-thick half-moons (use a mandoline) and toss in a bowl with the oil, parmesan, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper.Pour the milk into a big saucepan for which you have a lid and bring to a gentle simmer on a medium heat. Add the nutmeg, the cubed celeriac and a teaspoon of salt, and cook for 10 minutes, until tender. If your seafood mix is raw, add it now and cook for three minutes. Put a sieve over a large jug, drain the fish and celeriac, then set both aside.Wipe the pan clean and return to a medium heat. Add the butter and leeks, cover the pan, turn the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are soft but not coloured – about 10 minutes.Raise the heat to medium, add the garlic and chilli, and cook for a minute. Stir in the flour until fully mixed in – about 30 seconds – then slowly add the wine and reserved milk, whisking as you go to avoid lumps, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often, until thickened. Stir in the spinach, herbs, capers, lemon zest, seafood, half a teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of pepper, and turn off the heat.Tip the mix into a 30cm x 20cm oven dish and cover with the sliced celeriac, overlapping it to create a fish-scale effect. Sprinkle paprika on top, cover tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 25 minutes more, until the celeriac is cooked through and the bake is bubbling. Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then serve.Flan is the Spanish-speaking world’s answer to creme caramel. Custard is a tricky thing to get right at the best of times: cornflour can make it too floury if it’s not cooked properly, while eggs curdle if the heat is too high. But you can cheat by putting all the custard ingredients in a blender and blitzing them for 30 seconds: even a trained patissier wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. You can use orange instead of tangerine, though the latter tastes rather special.For the custard1 ancho chilli (you want 18g, so you may need only ¾ of a chilli), soaked in boiling water for 10 minutes270g condensed milk100ml double cream400ml whole milk3 eggs1 tsp vanilla bean paste or essence1 tsp grated tangerine zest1 generous pinch flaked sea saltHeat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2. Put a 20cm x 20cm nonstick square tin (or a similar sized ovenproof dish) in the oven to warm make sure the tin isn’t spring-form, though, because you don’t want the caramel to escape.For the caramel, put the sugar in a large pan on a medium heat and cook for about eight minutes: resist the urge to stir, and instead swirl the pan around until the sugar has melted. Continue swirling slowly until the sugar turns a dark amber, then quickly take the tin from the oven and pour in the caramel, tilting the tin as you go so it covers the base evenly. Leave the caramel to set while you make the custard.Take the chilli from its soaking water and squeeze out any liquid. Discard the stalk, put the chilli, seeds included, and all the other custard ingredients in a blender and blitz on high speed for about 30 seconds, until well combined.Tap the base of the caramel tin to check it has set (if it hasn’t, leave it a little longer), then pour in the custard through a mesh sieve, to catch any larger bits of chilli.Gently lift the tin into a larger, high-sided baking dish and put in the oven. Carefully pour boiling water into the larger dish to come halfway up the sides of the tin, then bake for 40-50 minutes, until the surface is set and golden-brown, but the flan still has a good wobble to it (it will set more in the fridge). Lift the flan out of its water bath, leave to cool slightly, then refrigerate for at least three hours.Take the flan out of the fridge half an hour before you want to eat it. To serve, run a knife around the edge of the flan to release it, and place a lipped plate larger than the tin on top of the flan tin. Holding both the plate and the tin together, quickly flip the whole thing over and gently lift off the tin: the flan should release itself on to the plate. Drizzle the tangerine juice over the top and serve at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a25dff85c588a23ba551fa156ece5fe9d12593/1292_589_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS90d2l0dGVyX2RlZmF1bHQucG5n\u0026amp;s=267ff9690d95badb209b621e217b67ef","title":"advertising no longer pays global publicity titans martin sorrell","story":"Not so long ago a bearish Sir Martin Sorrell berated the advertising industry for its unrealistic “Don Draperish optimism” in the face of tough times, in a reference to hit TV series Mad Men and its depiction of the halcyon days and excesses of 1960s adland. Now it is the next generation, of Sorrell and his “math men” – the builders of global empires designed to churn out profits – that is now perhaps on the brink of becoming history.Sorrell’s departure may have been prompted by an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct, but with WPP’s share price down a third after a disastrous year, questions were already being raised about whether the 73-year-old’s vision was outdated in modern advertising.Gerontocracies are common in medialand: Rupert Murdoch is 87 Sumner Redstone, controller of Viacom and CBS, is 94 industry titan Barry Diller is still in business at 76 and John Malone, who controls Discovery and Virgin Media owner Liberty Global, is 77. And, like Sorrell, the businesses that the ageing media barons run are all facing the same core challenge as WPP: the internet.“I think with the departure of Sir Martin, we’re seeing the beginning of the end for a generation of media and advertising leaders and the baton being handed over to the new generation,” says David Jones, the former global chief executive of French ad group Havas, who now runs his own technology branding firm. “There’s a huge digital ide between the heads of the big legacy companies, who for the most part are well over 70 years old and grew up in a pre-internet, pre-mobile world, and the founders and heads of the tech companies, who for the most part are under 30 years old and helped invent the technology revolution we’re living through.”For adland, the rise of social media and the power of Google and Facebook has raised valid questions from advertisers about who they spend their money with and whether big groups like WPP, France’s Publicis or US giants Omnicom and IPG still offer the best model to create and buy campaigns for them.Procter \u0026amp Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser and owner of brands from Gillette to Pampers, says that by 2021 it will have cut more than $1.1bn (£780m) from the amount it spends with ad groups compared with 2015 levels. Marketing chief Marc Pritchard, who commands an almost $11bn annual marketing budget, has said that it is time to end the “archaic Mad Men model” and “take back control” of its advertising spending.Scale was once the biggest selling-point of the global holding groups – providing the muscle to get big savings when buying ad slots or rolling out an international ad campaign – but now it is increasingly being seen as a costly, cumbersome achilles heel.P\u0026ampG used to work with 6,000 ad agencies around the world it now works with 2,500 and expects to cut that number in half again. Moving more of its business inhouse will result in $2bn savings previously spent with agencies. “We have had too many people between us and the consumer,” he said recently. “We have to move a lot faster.”The sprawling WPP empire is a case in point: it has more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate advertising and marketing businesses, working in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries.Most of WPP’s rivals are also run by men much closer to the end of their career than the beginning. Omnicom’s John Wren is 65, IPG’s Michael Roth 72.Publicis, the world’s third-largest ad group, signalled a generational change when 46-year-old Arthur Sadoun was appointed chief executive last summer. Nevertheless, his predecessor Maurice Lévy, 76, still keeps a watchful eye on the French advertising empire, having only moved as far as its powerful board.The media landscape has been upended by the rise of technology that has enabled a new generation of digitally savvy consumers to watch what they want, when they want, on any device they want. Traditional media companies are struggling to keep pace with that change and are having to contend with the rise of Silicon Valley competitors – from Facebook to Netflix – which threaten their business models.The Netflix streaming juggernaut shows no sign of slowing down, recently smashing analysts’ expectations to hit more than 125 million global subscribers, and the combined market value of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook is a staggering $2.8 trillion.A desperate need for scale and digital investment is underpinning a frenzy of consolidation in global media, to try to inject life into the ageing models of traditional players.Rupert Murdoch’s decision to break up the global empire he spent a lifetime building – with the $66bn sale of 21st Century Fox, including Sky and the Hollywood studio behind X-Men, to Disney – is a stunning admission that, in the global war against deep-pocketed digital rivals, even he was too sub-scale to compete.Disney’s play for Fox came at the same time as it pulled its content – From Star Wars and Pixar films to the Marvel universe and its traditional cartoons – from Netflix in the US as it races to build its own streaming service in the hope it isn’t too late to catch up.Redstone, along with daughter Shari, is desperate to recombine CBS with Viacom to increase their chances of survival. And after being rebuffed by Murdoch in its effort to take over Fox, Comcast, owner of NBC Universal, is attempting to gatecrash Disney’s deal by mounting a £22bn bid for Fox’s crown jewel, Sky.“I think Martin’s departure is a symptom: we are seeing pressure across the media industry,” says Peter Scott, founder of digital marketing group Be Heard. “There is a need to fight back against power of Amazon and Netflix and others that are disrupting and intruding. There is a transformation happening. A technology revolution.”At 73, Sorrell seems fit and his indefatigable work ethic is as strong as ever, making the issue of age seemingly irrelevant, even with a new baby to deal with. The idea of retirement couldn’t have been further from his mind. “Only when they shoot me,” he had said.Well, in the corporate sense, that is exactly what has happened. And he may be just the first casualty of a generation of leaders who are finding their ageing business models catching up with them.Gibbs SR toothpaste (1955)At 8.12pm on 22 September 1955 the UK advertising industry was changed forever when Gibbs SR toothpaste became the first ever TV commercial to be broadcast. The toothpaste brand’s place in history was purely down to luck: it won the right to be first in a lottery among 23 brands including Guinness, Surf, Lux, Batchelors Peas and Brillo pads. Initial scepticism that TV would be any good at selling products was short-lived, as the medium dominated the advertising landscape for the next five decades until internet advertising came of age.Coca-Cola – Hilltop (1971)Almost half a century since it was created, Hilltop remains one of the most influential and catchy TV ads in history – “I’d like to buy the world a coke and keep it company …”. It was a global phenomenon that proved that advertising was powerful enough to appropriate anything to sell a product, in this case the very anti-establishment movement of the 1960s, which would have been dead set against such commercial exploitation. “It managed to legitimise the spirit of the age and probably kill the hippy movement stone dead,” says Vicki Maguire, joint creative chief at Grey London.Conservative Party – Labour Isn’t Working (1979)The Saatchi brothers’ poster for Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative party in 1979 forever changed political advertising in the UK. Before it, political ads were not a feature of UK election campaigns: they were a tactic employed in US presidential races. After it, political attack ads aiming to smear the opposition became a key part of the electioneering arsenal. It remains the most memorable and effective piece of UK political advertising of all time – Tony Blair with “demon eyes” is up there too, with Vote Leave’s slogan “take back control” now arguably joining them.UK government – Aids campaign (1987)The chilling TV ads featuring a falling tombstone and John Hurt’s portentous voiceover – “Don’t die of ignorance” – was an incredibly brave campaign and the world’s first major government-sponsored Aids awareness drive. Its hard-hitting tactics, and the success that followed, would be emulated by governments around the world as nations struggled to educate the public in the early days of HIV amid predictions of deaths on a massive scale. “It turned what had felt like a conveniently ‘gay problem’ into a public health issue,” said David Billing, chief creative officer at The Beyond Collective. “The nation was shocked into talking about Aids.”Chanel No 5 – Le Film (2004)Nicole Kidman was at the height of her Hollywood stardom, as was fellow Austalian Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Romeo \u0026amp Juliet) when the pair teamed up to make an ad that cost £18m, the most expensive ever made for TV. Kidman was paid $3.7m to play an actress pursued by paparazzi, wearing couture outfits designed by Karl Lagerfeld to the sound of Debussy. The ad marked both the zenith and the last hurrah of the Mad Men era of unbridled profligate spending: the internet era was soon to usher in phrases such as “return on investment” as the bean counters started to take control.Dove – Campaign For Real Beauty (2004)Dove cleverly tapped into a growing disconnection between the perfect models used in advertising and the “real” women who buy the products. The break with convention – including using normal-sized women and exposing how beauty can go from “real to retouched” in a speeded-up makeover video – has proved to be a masterclass of the new social responsibility expected from advertisers (while still making bucketloads of money for Unilever). “Those ordinary women were both inspirational and aspirational at the same time,” says Maguire. “Women who had previously spent thousands chasing the beauty myth were starting to see through the bullshit.This was timed beautifully.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae45a39aa4e3088e938edb7884ed2c793e897a3/0_118_3511_2106/master/3511.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86f81008397f7b8c45ffa4a3ddcf5061","title":"avicii appreciation the poster boy for edm who struggled with the spotlight","story":"The death of the 28-year-old Swedish DJ and producer marks a tragic end to an illustrious career underpinned by pressure Avicii was an avatar as much as he was a producer. Exploding on to the scene in 2011 with his unabashedly saccharine hit Levels, the Swedish musician born Tim Bergling represented, depending on where one stood, either the best or worst of dance music’s rise in the United States.Just 21 years old at the time of his breakthrough, Bergling was perhaps an unlikely star. All cheekbones and platinum hair, he never seemed entirely comfortable in the spotlight. Friends and colleagues described him as shy and quiet, a sweet kid with the heart of a technician. In interviews, his responses could come off as canned or reticent, as reporters probed for answers from an artist seemingly more comfortable at his computer assembling tracks. But his music was a different story. Avicii was one of the first EDM stars to arrive on the scene fully formed, and he hit just as dance music was for the first time gaining mainstream popularity in the US. Discovered on MySpace by veteran Dutch producer Laidback Luke, Bergling took his name from the Buddhist term for hell, avīci, and began pumping out an arsenal of hits that quickly defined a burgeoning genre. Tracks including Levels, Fade Into Darkness and Silhouettes were slick, massive, earnest and unapologetically pop-oriented. With them, Avicii paid homage to influences like Swedish House Mafia and Daft Punk while at the same time creating the tension build and release template still being replicated nearly a decade later. These tracks became anthems for the millions of millennials gathering at massive festivals to partake in the relentlessly escapist electronic music scene of the late aughts. Avicii’s music was wildly popular among a generation coming of age in the post 911 era of perpetual war and economic uncertainty. While grunge and hip-hop had been the bluntly angry clarion calls for previous generations, EDM provided these kids with the spirit of celebration and unity that ran counter to headlines on the nightly news. EDM was collective catharsis, and Avicii was, for a time, the biggest artist delivering it. He was anti-politic, existing in a bubble of champagne and confetti bursts, and his music served as a sonic antidepressant for listeners around the world.It was a dance dance revolution that didn’t sit well with many veteran scenesters who had been plugging away in the electronic music underground since the late 70s. Shiny, populist and capitalist to its core, EDM ran counter to the defining values held dear by many fringe-dwelling old school scenesters. The kids didn’t care. And neither did Avicii, who crisscrossed the globe headlining the world’s biggest dance music and mainstream pop festivals – Tomorrowland, Ultra Miami, EDC Las Vegas, Coachella and more – and signing on for massively lucrative Las Vegas residences just as the city was establishing itself as the United States’ EDM hub. Through the guidance of his manager Ash Pournouri, a Svengali type with whom Avicii was deeply close, Avicii raised the pay grade for DJs throughout the scene, pushing into the mid six figures for festival and club sets. With his head floating on billboards along the interstate from Los Angeles to Vegas, he was literally the EDM poster boy. Onstage, Bergling typically sported jeans, a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap, with his right hand lifted and moving along to the music while he happily shuffled behind the decks. If he was uncomfortable in the media, the stage seemed to be a sweet spot. He once called attention the worst part of his job, saying, “I love what I do, but I’ve never liked being recognized or being in the spotlight.”His music earned him a pair of Grammy nominations, one for his work on David Guetta’s Sunshine and another in 2013 for Levels. In a 2013 interview, he told me these nominations were the proudest moments of his career. The freshness and crossover appeal of his sound also brought a line of superstars eager for EDM crossover plays to his door. He co-produced a track on Madonna’s 2015 LP Rebel Heart while Sky Full of Stars, a 2014 collaboration with Coldplay, was a worldwide radio hit.His own biggest smash was 2013’s Wake Me Up, a folk music crossover that was booed by the audience at Ultra when Avicii debuted it at the festival in 2013. No matter. Featuring singer Aloe Blacc, the urgently uplifting track hit No 1 in more than 40 countries and presciently tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated. The song appeared on his 2013 solo debut album True, which hit the top 10 in more than 15 countries. But there were signs of wear and tear too. The tour schedule of the Avicii juggernaut was intense, with him hitting clubs and festivals on every continent except Antarctica and often playing two shows a night. Bergling cancelled his headlining set at Ultra 2014 in order to have emergency gallbladder and appendix surgery. (Deadmau5 stepped in to take his place.) A 2013 GQ profile captured the alcohol-soaked hedonism of his life as the boy king of EDM and found Bergling “subsisting on a diet of Red Bull, nicotine, and airport food”. (The article was widely slammed by Avicii fans, with Bergling himself calling it “truly unfair and incorrect”.) In 2014, the addiction rumors were substantiated when Avicii cancelled all of his scheduled concerts due to health problems. “In the beginning, I’d party a lot … every night was a party,” he told me in 2013. “But I just realized that for me personally, my body and mind couldn’t handle it any more.” He officially retired from performing live in 2016, at the age of 26. Two years later and Avicii’s publicist has announced that Bergling was found dead on the Arabian peninsula, thousands of miles from his home in Stockholm. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” Diana Baron said in a statement. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”Mainstream popularity can often feel like ritual sacrifice, as we build people up only to stand captivated as they descend – into addiction, into turmoil, into avīci. Tim Bergling’s story has come to a tragic if not entirely unpredictable end, one at odds with the joy of the music he so expertly produced during his brief but influential moment at the top. It’s hard to mourn to a song like Levels that so adamantly denies the darkness. EDM is about joyful celebration in the face of conflict. Perhaps this was Bergling’s undoing. It is also his legacy.

And now there’s a new way to take it all in: in the US, the Record Store Crawl initiative has been set up to explore the wealth of stores in each city. With RSD looming, we thought this could be a model for a survey of the health of record shops in British cities: so, four writers have gone round four cities with some of the UK’s most exciting new DJs and producers, picking out their ultimate record-shopping routes.In London, Debi Ghose – aka Debonair – seems at home in Low Company. Not only is it her local spot, in Hackney Downs, but “their selection is really close what I play, I trust their curation”. Her club and radio sets tend towards the 1980s experimentalism of post-punk, EBM and early house. The chipboard and white walls of Low Company are decorated with 80s industrial music art, its sections are called things like “Strange  Dream  Avant”, and Kenny, the crop-haired Scotsman behind the counter, is playing unwell-sounding outsider punk in between nipping outside for rollups. The shop clearly revels in being on the margins. Not only is it not participating in Record Store Day, it had considered not even opening on the day as it’s the business’s first birthday the day before and they’ll all be hungover. Debi buys a ticket for the birthday party, laughing with Kenny about how many “reprobate” mutual friends will be there.In the quarter-hour it takes us to stroll into bustling Dalston, Debi details her record shop history. At school in Leamington Spa, she “wasn’t a rebel, did well, but got bored and needed something more to focus on”. As a teenage Smashing Pumpkins and Joy Division fan, the local Fopp Records “was heaven to me” at 15 she applied for a job there. She is endlessly thankful that the manager – a DJ known as The Lovely Helen, resident at Brum house institution Wobble – noted her enthusiasm and picked her over other (older, male, ostensibly more qualified) candidates. Behind the counter, she gained confidence talking about music, and expanded her own tastes dramatically: “I had disposable income and cheap records,” she laughs, “I bought so much!”We get to Eldica and are warmly greeted by Annie, who runs the place with her former rave producer husband Andy, and named it for her Trinidadian grandma. In contrast to Low Company’s austere hipness, it’s a piled-up Aladdin’s cave of second-hand vinyl, leaning heavily towards reggae, jazz and soul. “When I joined NTS Radio in 2011,” says Debi, referring to the taste-making online station, “it was great to have this place round the corner, as a connection to the older generation of music lovers already in Dalston. It’s a lovely spot, nothing’s overpriced, but you need three hours to properly dig here.”Sadly we don’t have that, as we need to get to Soho. After university, where she learned presenting and mixing on the uni radio station, Debi had a short stint working in an advertising agency. She was more interested in spending every lunchtime in Soho’s record shops, though, which didn’t go unnoticed: her leaving present from the agency was vouchers for Phonica. Phonica is now the West End’s main dance music hub constant house music plays as established DJs try out 12-inches at the listening posts, and Debi reels off great “in-stores” she’s seen here as her own DJ career began.Nick, who serves us, is a DJ too and runs the well-regarded Meda Fury label as Debi umms and ahhs over a Frankie Goes to Hollywood 12-inch, he shoves a fantastically weird new EP of Japanese electro-dub-folk songs and some Lyonnaise deep house into her listening pile, and passes me a moody electro 12-inch. He’s good: we buy all three, then walk a couple of minutes to Berwick Street, where Reckless hangs on in there, resisting gentrification, unlike most of that strip of secondhand-record shops. There’s no listening posts, only buying on spec, which Debi does often I snap up a Planet Mu acid house record going super cheap.It’s quite a schlep to southeast London with the rush hour starting. (We’re glad at this point that we left Notting Hill’s Honest Jon’s, and Debi’s very favourite shop, Alan’s in East Finchley, off our itinerary.) Sadly, Rat Records in Camberwell is closing as we arrive. So after briefly pressing our noses against the window like kids at a sweetshop, as Debi describes it – “just a really classic record shop, which was my regular place to go when I lived in Brixton” – we get a 171 bus five minutes down the road to Peckham.There’s no fear of Rye Wax being shut, mind. In the basement of Rye Lane’s vast Bussey Building – where grubby raving spaces sit alongside African churches, community groups and yoga studios – it’s also a bar and music venue, open late every night. A DJ is playing Latin jazz as we arrive. “It’s the perfect model of how a shop can be a real hub,” Debi says. “It’s not just a venue, but somewhere I’m guaranteed to meet other DJs and people I know.” Sure enough, it’s buzzing as Debi chats and browses, owner Tom tells me how they’re bypassing RSD releases and instead cutting their own single-copy dubplates. Once Debi has found an intriguing compilation of 80s Catalan DIY rarities, we settle down at a table for a drink, musing on what it must have been like for experimental Spanish musicians under Franco, and taking stock of our day. “It’s hard to know what will happen to record shops,” says Debi. “They’re never going to be what they were before downloading. But if they can turn into places like this, I’m happy!”“This is proper Bristol weather,” grins Omar McCutcheon, the latest star in the city’s long history of experimental dance music. The drizzle is unrelenting as we pace around the Stokes Croft area on our record store crawl, but even though it’s overcast, this cultural nerve centre vividly compensates. Lurid murals loom over the urban sprawl terraced houses are painted in fuschia and lavender. Every other shop is a quirky bar, vegan cafe or vintage clothing emporium. “You’re always getting creative stimulation in Bristol,” says McCutcheon.Under the moniker Batu, the 24-year-old is the next in a long line of Bristol musicians who create new forms from low-end frequencies: his mentors Pinch and Peverelist helped pioneer dubstep’s deep e into techno in the mid-2000s, followed by the latter’s cutting-edge collective Livity Sound, and now Batu has taken the baton and is veering off in an even more abstract direction. With his label and night Timedance, he pairs sound-system culture with techno to create sculptural club punishers that fizz with lambent ideas and curious samples, as do the young local artists he releases such as Bruce, Ploy, Lurka and Giant Swan.Idle Hands is the shop where the city’s new wave congregates. It’s a no-frills dance music specialist run by Chris Farrell, with well-curated racks of new 12-inches ning the UK underground. “It’s very important to me – a meeting spot, a hub of Bristol music,” says McCutcheon as he spots an old Bass Clef tune he’s been after for ages and locks straight into some headphones.Idle Hands is one of the new boutique record shops that have sprung up here in the past few years, after a wave of closures. Farrell says Record Store Day doesn’t make much of a difference to the shop in terms of sales, but because all the pressing plants are booked up with limited edition novelty items such as translucent green vinyl Doctor Who soundtracks, new stock doesn’t come through as readily in the weeks leading up to it. McCutcheon still finds a wedge of vinyl he wants, including a compilation of early experiments by Japanese musician Kuniyuki Takahashi, which recently came out on a leftfield label he admires, Music from Memory.McCutcheon is relatively new to the city, having moved here four years ago from Oxfordshire for the creative music technology course at Bath Spa University (“dubstep finishing school”, Farrell quips). His growing touring schedule means he doesn’t get as much time to shop locally as he’d like. Which may explain why we can’t seem to find next stop The Centre for Better Grooves. It was started by the founder of budget music chain Fopp but is, in contrast, “a wallet beater”, jokes McCutcheon. We pass Elevator Sound, a sleek shrine to modular synths, and bump into a postman who is by night a psychedelic DJ and points us in the right direction. Soon we are riffling through a luxurious number of jazz reissues with cosmic covers. Past a pair of congas, there’s a sizeable vintage rock section, but McCutcheon is less interested in that. “I’m more of a sound than a songs person,” he says, eyeing up a selection labelled “FX” that is ripe for sampling.Next we head to Wanted’s tiny record trailer, down a cobbled path in St Nick’s Market. McCutcheon immediately makes a beeline for the dancehall crates, and waxes lyrical over the Greensleeves Rhythm Album series, one of the longest-running of its kind, where various artists interpret the same rhythm. He has also recently been collecting reggae and dub 45s, the hub for which is Payback, around the corner. Paul Craine has been running this fir-green stall for 20 years and it’s where you can find Prince Buster 7-inches for £1, or more contemporary roots releases from Protoje or Chronixx. Payback is a window into the origins of Bristol’s obsession with making music so deep it can rattle your ribcage. The area’s African Caribbean sound-system heritage has laid the foundation for the subsequent genres of weighty, deep electronic music that have come through its streets: trip-hop, jungle, dubstep. For McCutcheon, that culture is also “integral to my identity. Living here, having family of Caribbean descent and growing up with reggae – all these ideas link back to where I see myself in the world.” No matter what record shop you’re in or producer you talk to, bass, says McCutcheon, is what unites the city: “It’s so ingrained in everything.”“Technooooo,” comes the jovial response from Henrietta Smith-Rolla when asked what section she gravitates towards in a record shop. “Always the techno section. I never go in with any idea of what I want to buy. I like not knowing.”Over coffee in Eastern Bloc, a cafe, venue and record shop in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, the hiss of the coffee machine whistles above the thudding techno pulsing from the speakers. “I’ve been doing music for over a decade but I didn’t know this was in me,” the 37-year-old says about Afrodeutsche, a project born two years ago whilst searching for her father. She learned that her Ghanaian roots also stretched into Russia and Germany, and thus found herself with a newfound identity and family history. The name, translating as African-German, was an epiphany that linked to the already eclectic music she was creating. “I just had this huge connection to it straight away. I never expected to realise myself artistically in this world.” Afrodeutsche blends techno, house, electro and anything else Smith-Rolla feels like throwing in, based on intuition. “Everything I write is always a translation of what’s going on with me. Even my NTS shows are just based on how I’m feeling,” she says, referring to her monthly radio show.As we walk upstairs and the throb of the beat grows louder, Smith-Rolla doesn’t nosee into the techno section but instead is greeted with a pile of 12-inches, recommended by Ben Marsden, the head house and techno buyer. This level of personal curation and assistance is crucial for smaller shops, he tells me. “I go in spurts of buying records,” Smith-Rolla says. “I’m not in shops all the time but when I am, I’m usually here.” She also buys online from places like Discogs and Boomkat. “I think record shops have got kinder,” she tells me, in-between playing Umwelt and Maelstrom on the listening turntable. “There’s been a change in how women are looked at and observed. There’s no surprise any more when a woman walks in to buy a Detroit techno record. I would get nervous going into shops when I was younger, but things have become more welcoming.”While the music of Afrodeutsche is deeply personal and emotional – she describes it as “dark optimism” – when Smith-Rolla DJs, it’s all about getting loose and dismantling the seriousness of some in the techno world. “I like to have fun. I don’t see myself as a DJ my sets are …” she stops mid-sentence and makes a series of explosive, chaotic noises. “As far as I’m concerned, anyone can do this. There isn’t a wall between us. There’s no bravado, it’s just fun times. Manchester is the kind of place that if you’re into good stuff then you’ll be invited to do good things it’s a small city and everyone is connected.” As we move around the corner onto Oldham Street on a bustling afternoon and into Piccadilly Records, Smith-Rolla shows her goofy side as I look over to see her doing the downward escalator routine, disappearing behind a rack of records, cackling away.Smith-Rolla lived in Devon and London before Manchester, and is positively glowing about her time here. “Manchester is a beautiful place because it is nurturing without question. It’s here where I felt I had complete freedom to make stuff.” This freedom to create has seen her work with 808 State’s Graham Massey, score a reinterpretation of the 1992 documentary Baraka, and become part of GRRRL, a group assembled by In Place of War, a project that works to mobilise and connect artists in conflict zones. The eight-piece, and their “insane, pure energy” live performance, recently played the Commonwealth Games’ closing ceremony.In Vinyl Exchange, she takes an armful of records to the counter. The man behind it sincerely asks how her music is going, telling her he’s heard good things about her live shows. On the way out, she reflects on this sense of community and support she finds in the record shops, clubs and people of Manchester: “I’m surrounded by encouragement. That’s what Manchester does, it makes you want to be involved and help people out.”Cratedigging and cardio may seem like two diametrically opposed pastimes but in Glasgow it is possible to combine both. Palais de Danse – a cramped but colourful garret stacked with preloved vinyl – lies behind a doorway on Sauchiehall Street. You just have to make it up four narrowing flights of stairs first. This is where Kenny Grieve and Dan Lurinsky of Dixon Avenue Basement Jams (DABJ) – local label owners and in-demand DJs – want to begin their Glasgow record shop crawl. Even on a miserable Friday morning, the elevated view from the fire escape makes it feel like an appropriate place to survey the city’s music retail scene, once we get our breath back. “Some workout, that,” Grieve says to Dennis, Palais de Danse’s wiry proprietor. “Try doing it with a box of records,” he replies, “it’s murder.” There are deep bins of house and techno, while a lone box of dubstep sits atop an ancient safe. Grieve and Lurinsky rifle through the stock with the flowing fingers of veteran vinyl spelunkers their eventual haul includes a hidden gem from Dave Clarke’s 90s techno imprint Magnetic North. Palais de Danse is one of a new wave of independent vinyl shops that have opened in Glasgow in the past three years. The next stop, Rubadub, is more of an institution: since 1992, it has been a hub for DJs looking to stock up on desirable new imports, upgrade equipment or just talk shop with fellow devotees. While some stores host a chaotic decor of ripped posters and countless club flyers, Rubadub has always been stripped-back, cool, clinical. A recent interior redesign has reinforced the monochrome look but retained the shop’s signature feature: a tightly-wound cast-iron spiral staircase leading up to a cluster of listening decks. Lurinsky is a longstanding Rubadub employee, and says practically all of the staff were – like him – regular customers first, drawn to the communal vibe. While the shop may not officially take part in Record Store Day (“I think most people feel it’s all got a bit commercial,” says Lurinsky) there will still be a day-long party on 21 April, to christen the refit. Next, we head south of the Clyde to visit Otherside, a narrow, seductive emporium that has offered both second-hand vinyl and eccentric vintage objects since 2015. JD Twitch, of Glasgow’s venerable Optimo club night, once offloaded so much excess vinyl here he had his own section it is perhaps the only place in the city where it is possible to pick up a happy hardcore classic from DJ Mental Theo and a Victorian carpet beater in the same trip. Having been invited to rummage through some unsorted stock, Lurinsky is elated to find a record by Detroit legend Claude Young he has coveted for years. Grieve somehow emerges with a hookah pipe and a chipped plaster statue of the Virgin Mary, decor for the new DABJ office-cum-studio by the riverside. Their label name was inspired by a raucous mid-2000s in-the-know after-hours party staged in a crudely converted basement flat on Dixon Avenue, and the final stop on our crawl is only a few streets away from that spiritual birthplace. Some Great Reward, a cosy cafe that doubles as a physical outpost for an online record store, opened earlier this month. In the main space, new releases like Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s Sex and Food are displayed on the wall with smart, snappy recommendation notes. Over coffee and a Bakewell slice, Grieve and Lurinsky tot up how much they have spent – almost £100, not including the Virgin Mary – and reflect on how the Glasgow music scene has waxed and waned over the years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee07645167ffa02942a045980037b19c5184f922/298_374_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8814aa8b5489dca3bd25d2270ff515","title":"avicii a life in pictures","story":"The death of the 28-year-old Swedish DJ and producer cuts short a globally successful career, filled with arena tours and big star collaborations"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0521c6ee9e24e677a8408ddfd88aa2cd448d7a7d/317_77_2723_1633/master/2723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=085f15f5ae156fddad843d89280b99d4","title":"carwyn jones to step down as first minister of wales","story":"Jones tells Welsh Labour party conference he will stand down in autumnThe first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, will stand down in the autumn.He made the surprise announcement at the Welsh Labour party conference in Llandudno on Saturday.Jones’s decision means Wales will have a new first minister at the start of December.He became first minister and leader of the Labour party in Wales in December 2009 – a decade after he was first elected to the Welsh assembly. The Welsh Labour leader had been under significant pressure since Carl Sargeant was found dead in early November, four days after being sacked as a minister over harassment allegations.This week, opposition parties in Wales criticised the Labour-led government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before he killed himself.The Welsh Tories claimed during an assembly debate that it was morally wrong for the report not to be published.Jones’s decision to stand down comes a day after lawyers for Jack Sargeant, Carl’s son, wrote a strongly worded letter accusing him of causing considerable distress.An inquiry into how Jones handled the sacking has not yet begun. The letter said: “The inescapable fact here is that someone sadly lost their life, a much-loved family member, and due process must be followed expeditiously to enable those closest to him to find some closure.” Sargeant’s lawyer, Neil Hudgell told BBC Wales: “It’s a culmination of a series of frustrations over the delay to the start of the inquiry. Our thoughts very much are that it’s been dehumanised within the first minister’s office: there’s some game-playing going on and some deliberate stalling tactics.” When asked about the accusation his manner had caused distress, Jones said: “I can’t see how that can be the case.” In his speech on Saturday, the first minister paid tribute to his wife, Lisa, and their children, and thanked them for their support. “There are people I haven’t been fair to in recent times, and that’s my family,” he said.“In any normal political career you expect to be put through the wringer and have your everything challenged. I don’t think anyone can know what these last few months have been like, other than Lisa and the kids. They have helped me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them at times and it’s time for me think about what’s fair to them.”Jones told the Welsh Labour conference he was “incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together so far”.Earlier on Saturday, Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris was elected as the party’s first deputy leader.Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood congratulated Jones on his nine years as first minister but said Wales not only needed a new leader but a new government. “Wales can and must be better than this – rearranging the deckchairs will not deliver the change we need,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce78344533b456b29e8bfdf27e2a84b85defe190/0_60_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=404f911414d733d96fe203b177c6a4be","title":"expanding earth could we build cities in space","story":"Meet the startup hoping to colonise the final frontier, one zero-gravity 3D printer at a timeDuring the early weeks of his 167-day stint aboard the International Space Station in 2014, astronaut Barry “Butch” Wilmore noticed that a torque wrench was missing. “It’s not uncommon for things to disappear in space,” he tells me over the phone from the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “You just don’t have gravity keeping stuff in place.” Wilmore mentioned the missing tool to Nasa’s mission control as he was tending to a 3D printer, a microwave-sized box that extrudes heated plastic to build up objects layer by layer, which was being tested on the space station.About a week later, Wilmore opened the door to the 3D printer to find a perfect replica of his missing wrench. He was thrilled, a moment captured in a photo that was shared with the world’s media at the time. Until that point, the machine had produced only very simple objects. “This was a printed, all-inclusive wrench, with a ratchet mechanism, that worked,” Wilmore says.Unbeknown to the astronaut, the team that designed and operated the 3D printer – a California-based company called Made In Space – had been listening in on his conversation with Nasa (a privilege for companies working with the space agency) and worked round the clock to design a version of the tool that met Nasa’s rigorous safety requirements.“Once Nasa approved the wrench, we sent the file to the printer – essentially we emailed it to space and hit print,” says Jason Dunn, Made In Space’s co-founder and chief technology officer, sitting across the table in a conference room at the company’s headquarters in Moffett Field, Santa Clara County. “I get goosebumps every time I think about that story.”For Dunn, that wrench is symbolic of an entirely new frontier in space exploration, one in which his eight-year-old company is a pioneer: manufacturing items in space, rather than relying only on those objects you can find room to pack on a rocket from Earth.“It’s a really neat capability that allows us as humans to extend our reach beyond Earth,” he tells me. Supplying the 3D printer on the International Space Station was only the start: the company is developing systems for making and assembling not only small tools and trinkets, but giant structures such as satellites and, eventually, even space colonies – houses on the surface of the moon or Mars, or giant spaceships on which people could live and work.Dunn, 33, is sitting in a scruffy conference room called The Bridge – a nod to the Star Trek command centre – on the second of two floors in a long building that once served as barracks for the US navy and now houses most of Made In Space’s 43 employees. It’s one of dozens of nondescript white buildings dotted around Moffett Field in Mountain View, which was closed as a military base in 1994 and turned over to Nasa for research purposes. The agency leases buildings to different advanced technology companies with whom it has research ties. From the outside, there’s no sign of the cosmic ambition bubbling up inside.With his stubble and dark hair, swept to one side, Dunn looks like a dishevelled Clark Kent. He traces his interest in exploration back to his childhood in Florida. He lived by the Gulf of Mexico, where he and his friends would spend hours in a little boat exploring mangroves and islands.“I grew up with this fascination with exploration,” he says. “This idea that I sit on the shore and I look out and I can’t even see the horizon, and I don’t know what’s beyond it.”That feeling grew after he watched the space shuttle launch from the nearby Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, seeing what looked like “a little star” moving up into the sky. “I remember the fascination of seeing that one star and thinking ‘There’s people on it, disappearing into space’,” he says. “Everyone on the planet sits on the shoreline of space. It’s this big ocean we should be exploring,” he adds, with a tinge of wistful disappointment about the lack of progress.For Dunn, working at Nasa seemed inevitable: he was inspired by his high school physics teacher, who had been a finalist in a group of teachers selected by Nasa. Later, he studied aerospace engineering at the University of Orlando, where he worked on the shuttle programme via an internship at Boeing, which was contracted by Nasa to build the spacecraft.Dunn was enamoured of the vision for the space shuttle. Initially sold to the US Congress in the early 1970s as a reusable vehicle that would fly to space on a routine basis, it promised a much cheaper way of sending things there. This led scientists and engineers to think creatively about what they could build if they weren’t hamstrung by the prohibitive cost. “Once we have low-cost access into and back from space, then the industry changes and opens up,” Dunn explains.But the space shuttle did not fulfil this promise. It cost around $450m (£315m) every time it launched, so it didn’t fly nearly as frequently as proposed. In 2010, Nasa announced it was retiring the programme, after 30 years. “I felt a little heartbroken and very confused,” Dunn says, “because the whole reason I was doing this was to work on the space shuttle.”Feeling lost, he turned to a college-based club called Students for the Exploration and Development of Space, where he met entrepreneur Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize, a non-profit organisation that stages lucrative competitions to reward teams who develop breakthrough innovations. Dunn learned that he could create a startup in the space industry. This seemed “ludicrous” at the time: to his mind, the space industry was the preserve of nation states and giant companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing.In the summer of 2010, Dunn moved to California to attend Singularity University, an educational programme and business incubator co-founded by Diamandis, which focuses on “exponential” technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. There, Dunn met two of his Made In Space co-founders – Mike Chen and Aaron Kemmer – and together they spent 10 weeks researching the space industry and ideas for a sustainable business the fourth co-founder, chief engineer Michael Snyder, joined shortly after.The private space companies that attract the most attention – Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Virgin Galactic or Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin – prioritise fulfilling the original promise of the space shuttle: making access to space cheaper, by building reusable or larger rockets. Dunn, Chen and Kemmer asked a different question: “What if we didn’t need to launch anything at all?”Asking that question meant they were no longer restricted to dimensions of space objects that could be packed inside a rocket and able to survive the shuddering forces of a launch from Earth.“We could have structures in space so big, they could be the backbone of huge internet telecommunications antenna,” Dunn says. “Or a giant space station colony, or giant arrays of solar panels. Or we could send robots to the surface of the moon, or Mars, and use resources there to build habitats.”Dunn predicts that, over the next 10 years, space will become an industrial zone filled with orbiting factories. “Like oil platforms on the ocean, but not polluting.” There are already several companies – including Axiom Space, with which Made In Space has formed a partnership, and Bigelow Aerospace – building commercial space stations that could house manufacturing equipment in orbit within a couple of years, Dunn notes. Eventually, he says, people will go to the factories in space to work in much the same way as oil riggers do. “Although most of the manufacturing will be automated, you need people to fix and maintain the robots. It might not be pretty, it might not be that safe, but they will make a good living and then come back home.” Others will pay to go on “cruise ships”, either to orbit Earth or “do a nice week-long trip around the moon”. Companies such as Blue Origin and SpaceX are making “huge strides in delivering humans into space safely”.The relationship between orbiting factories and launch companies will be symbiotic. “They are really opening the frontier of space,” Dunn says. “We built our company on the promise of what they are creating they are building their companies based on the hope that Made In Spaces will exist.” He is close-lipped about specific commercial relationships with the launch companies, but says that his company is “actively working” with some of them.Over time, manufacturers will start to populate Earth’s orbit, starting at lower altitudes and working their way out in concentric circles until they reach the moon. Made In Space is even preparing for a lunar colony by developing “rego” bricks, made by combining a special polymer with simulated moon dust (regolith). The bricks, which look like samples of paving stones in various shades of grey, are heavy and feel plasticky. In theory, a brick-making autonomous vehicle could use the dust on the surface of the moon to construct housing ahead of astronauts’ arrival.Before building colonies on the moon, Made In Space had first to develop a 3D printer that worked in microgravity and could be put on the International Space Station. The printer is the company’s “foundational technology”, according to chief executive Andrew Rush, 33, a former intellectual property lawyer who came on board in 2015. He says he was “doomed to like space from birth”, having also grown up in Florida with parents who raised him on a diet of Star Trek, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein and physics books. Rush is one of many self-described sci-fi nerds at Made In Space. During interviews for new recruits, he will ask: “Star Trek or Star Wars?”“It’s mostly for fun,” he says. “It’s certainly a bit of a culture fit indicator.”I ask if Made In Space is more Star Trek or Star Wars. He laughs, then hesitates, reluctant to alienate an entire tribe of potential recruits. “You will get me in trouble,” he says, before conceding, “I think I’d say we are more Star Trek.” The life-sized cardboard cutout of Spock in the reception area is a bit of a giveaway. As are the framed posters on the wall by the stairs for 1960s episodes of sci-fi television series such as The Tholian Web and Mirror Mirror. “In Star Trek, the technology and the philosophy are often more motivating than in Star Wars, which is more of an epic-driven narrative and universe,” Rush explains, adding that “space is a team sport”.Dunn agrees: “We are creating the technology of Star Trek, building the replicator and transporter all in one with 3D printers.”At first, the team assumed that Nasa already had a 3D printer on the space station, but discovered that, although the agency had experimented with the idea in the late 1990s, it decided that the printing technology was too immature and the space station too small at the time to risk it. However, once the space station expanded, Nasa designated the US segment a national laboratory, inviting companies, research institutions and government agencies to pitch microgravity research projects. Made In Space flew out to the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, to pitch the commercial potential for 3D printing in space.The problem with regular 3D printers is that they are designed to work in gravity. Without that constant downward force, you have to secure every belt, cog and pulley – a few millimetres of unintended movement wreaks havoc on the printing mechanism, leading to failed or wonky printing.To ensure their 3D printer would work on the International Space Station, the Made In Space team spent many hours aboard a “vomit comet”, a converted passenger jet that follows a rollercoaster trajectory, offering about 20 seconds of weightlessness with every nosee. The team took their device on 10 such flights, each lasting around two hours, during which they monitored how the 3D printer was performing. “The feeling of zero gravity is impossible to explain,” Dunn explains. “It’s an entirely new feeling. Outside of when you’re an infant, you don’t really have entirely new feelings.”The team also had to automate almost every part of the experiment – the combination of strong anti-nausea pills and the novel sensation of floating meant human-made decisions were virtually impossible. Adjustments would be made to the printer after each flight, until they finally cracked it on the 10th mission.The printer was installed on the International Space Station in November 2014. The first thing it printed was a part for the printer: a plastic electronics cover about the size of a playing card with raised wording that read “Made In Space”. A month later, it would print the missing torque wrench, which underlined the potential of the technology to astronaut Barry Wilmore. “It’s going to be a game-changer, or as we say in Tennessee, it’s a big dang deal,” Wilmore tells me, although he adds that he wasn’t allowed to use the wrench because it had to be sent back to Earth for assessment.In 2015, the company was awarded the Space Frontier Foundation’s Vision To Reality award, which recognises outstanding achievement in space. (Previously, it was given to SpaceX for the launch of its reusable Falcon 1 rocket and to the Nasa Kepler Program for its low-cost mission to find planets outside of our solar system.)Staff operate the game-changing printer from their own mission control, a small office space with two work stations, each of them with three screens – some showing live video feeds from around the space station, others directly looking at what’s being printed. Made In Space will talk to a Nasa payload communications manager (a “Paycom”) in Houston, who will relay messages or instructions to the astronauts. On rare occasions, if there’s a complicated technical issue with one of the machines, Made In Space will communicate directly with astronauts.Unlike most startups, particularly in capital-intensive industries such as space, Made In Space has never taken any external investment. The core technologies of the business have been funded through development contracts from Nasa and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Research groups and companies also pay Made In Space for time spent using its microgravity 3D printer. The money from this core work allows the company to explore more out-there projects, such as building on the moon.Made In Space’s most ambitious experiment is Archinaut, a robot-operated factory that would be placed in Earth’s orbit to build large structures in space. If it pulls it off, it has the potential to radically transform the way satellites and space telescopes are built, repaired and enhanced. Without having to worry about fitting everything into a launch rocket, these orbiting structures can be much, much bigger. And bigger means better: better arrays of solar panels for powering missions into deep space better space telescopes for exploring the galaxies beyond our solar system and better satellite-delivered internet services on Earth. “You could send a satellite the size of a small refrigerator into orbit, then a robot would start to build it out,” Rush explains. “You could manufacture a 10m- to 15m-long antenna, the kind you usually get on a big honking 2,000kg satellite.”To make large structures, Made In Space needed a 3D printer that could print off as long an object as required. It managed it: there’s a 37m-long strut stretching the length of the hallway on the ground floor of its headquarters. “It’s larger than the solar wing on the ISS,” Rush says (in February, it was awarded a Guinness World Record for being the world’s longest 3D-printed nonassembled piece).The company is also thinking about the importing business, developing “space-enabled materials” – materials that can be manufactured only in microgravity, but which are needed on Earth. The first material made in this way was ZBLAN, a type of optical fibre that is structurally of higher quality than anything that can be made on Earth. Optical fibres, the blood vessels of the internet, are made by heating glass rods to melting temperature and drawing them out until they are thinner than a human hair. When that’s done on Earth, the different densities of the materials mean they can crystallise with tiny defects. “When we remove gravity, we allow the glass to crystallise in a uniform manner,” Dunn says. “Now you get a perfect glass crystal which allows light to pass through it with much more efficiency.”ZBLAN is in high demand from telecommunications companies desperate to deliver more bandwidth to their data-hungry customers. “Industries are buying exotic optical fibre at such a high cost,” Dunn says, “you can justify flying raw materials into space, making it and bringing it back, and still have a successful business.”With that in mind, Made In Space has developed a pilot factory contained inside a metal box roughly the size of a mini-fridge, which can produce a few kilometres of fibre per mission. So far, it’s only been tested fully on the space station once, before it was brought back to Earth to assess the quality of the fibre and tweak the system. This month, the machine is being installed a second time, for further testing.If the space industry develops according to Made In Space’s plan – and that’s a big if – the ultimate aim is to help build space colonies the size of cities. For Dunn, this is a necessity. “It’s not about leaving Earth, but expanding and saving it,” he says, pointing out that there are not enough resources on our planet to give every person an equal standard of living to that enjoyed in many western nations: having a laptop, mobile phone and car. “There’s a limit to how much energy production we can handle, how much CO2 we can keep putting into the atmosphere, how much food we can produce. The only way those limits disappear is when we think beyond the boundary of this finite volume of Earth.” • Objects printed by Made In Space’s zero-gravity 3D printer will be exhibited during the V\u0026ampA’s upcoming exhibition The Future Starts Here, from 12 May go to vam.ac.ukthefuturestartshere for details.Commenting on this piece?

It was they who were hustled into making mistakes and, while they kept trying to play and had the last word when the former Leinster second-row Tadhg Beirne completed the scoring in the final minute, the try was the faintest of consolations.Leinster had dominated every phase of the game: their first try came from a lineout, the second from a scrum and the third after a multi-phase move that ended with Garry Ringrose’s defence-splitting long pass. Runners attacked shoulders rather than chests, allowing a quick recycle and the Scarlets were subjected to wave after wave of attacks that not even John Barclay and James Davies could thwart with a turnover, desperately though they tried.The Scarlets started with 10 players who had opened Wales’s Six Nations campaign but Leinster had 12 who were part of Ireland’s grand slam-winning side. Leinster have the same ball-retaining capacity of their national team but, under Stuart Lancaster’s tutelage, play with more elan and daring behind, prompted by Johnny Sexton who scored his side’s fifth and final try after a bewilderingly swift passage of play that sucked in defenders and spat them out.The centre Robbie Henshaw, in his first appearance since he was injured against Italy in February, invariably got over the gainline and gave Leinster momentum but it was what happened after that which was telling. Leinster’s forwards, led by the Australian Scott Fardy, were ruthless in the clear-out, preventing the Scarlets from slowing down or stealing possession and giving them nothing to work with.Leinster defeated the holders Saracens here in the last round and they bear a hallmark of the Premiership club: supremely confident, efficient and bound by togetherness. After an hour, when they led 38-9, they were on course to break Saracens’ record European Cup semi-final victory, 46-6 against Clermont Auvergne four years ago, but as the replacements rolled on they eased up with a month of a long season still to be played and finals to be won.The Scarlets, making their first appearance at this stage since 2007, took the lead with a Leigh Halfpenny penalty but were never in the game. James Ryan scored Leinster’s first try after 10 minutes when Fardy’s lineout take led to the ball moving quickly behind where Isa Nacewa’s run into midfield from his wing created a space-making ersion.Although the Scarlets scrambled to prevent a try being scored directly, they were undone two phases later and there were times in the match when Leinster appeared to have a numerical advantage so adept were they at negating their opponents’ line speed in defence by running hard and recycling immediately.Sexton and Halfpenny exchanged penalties before Leinster scored their second try through the prop Cian Healy after putting the Scarlets under pressure at a scrum and again at the breakdown. The Welsh region’s first meaningful attack came after 36 minutes and ended when Aaron Shingler dropped a pass: they were then 17-9 down, a deficit they would have accepted at half-time having had so little possession and territory.They held out until four seconds from the break. Having shown they could attack from set pieces, Leinster launched a multi-phase move that ended with Garry Ringrose’s long pass giving Fergus McFadden the room to score on the right wing. The wing injured his knee while touching down and 10 minutes after the restart, his replacement, Jordan Larmour, created the fourth try after dispossessing Rhys Patchell. It was scored by Fardy, who was later denied a second for a double movement.Sexton had by then jinked over in his final act before being taken off as a nod to the battles that lay ahead. The Scarlets kept going, Scott Williams denying Rob Kearney with a defiant tackle in the corner, and like so many before them, found success in Europe tends to come after the pain of disappointment.“We have no complaints,” said the Scarlets’ captain, Ken Owens. “There is no one better at executing a game plan and it will be a very good side that beats them.” The Welsh side hope to have another chance next month in the final of the Pro14 here but it is not an opportune time to play Irish sides, home or away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97248fb2d9276a4afdbfd379f57a3ac90a8fcdc1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee624e6c612612e89c2c892d949144e9","title":"maltese politicians face calls for alleged money laundering inquiry","story":"Opposition leaders file court action against PM’s chief of staff and former energy ministerOpposition leaders in Malta have filed an application to court asking for a formal inquiry into the offshore activities of prime minister Joseph Muscat’s chief of staff and one of his leading ministers.The opposition, in their application, want a magistrate to determine whether there have been any potential breaches of the criminal code, including money laundering.The application, filed on Thursday, cites revelations from the Guardian’s Daphne Project and leaked reports by the country’s financial investigation agency, the FIAU, into the affairs of the cabinet minister Konrad Mizzi and Muscat’s top aide, Keith Schembri.Both men have consistently denied any wrongdoing. Lawyers for Mizzi said the application, made by members of the Nationalist party, “expose the political partisan motives of the allegations against him”. “Dr Mizzi will defend his rights to the fullest extent permitted by law,” they added.The application was prompted by reports the FIAU had found that payments totalling €1.3m (£1.14m) were made into a shell company in Dubai. The company, called 17 Black, was described as one of the “target clients” for two Panama entities of which Schembri and Mizzi were beneficiaries. The MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil said the two men should step down. “The longer they continue running the country the deeper our country’s reputation will sink,” he said.Filed by Busuttil and the Maltese MEP David Casa, the court application states: “The inquiring magistrate is in a position to determine the full truth … and the case to do so if even more compelling considering that the persons involved are the right hand of the Maltese prime minister and the minister of energy.”A 120-page draft report by the FIAU sets out evidence that 17 Black received payments from a contractor engaged to work on a flagship energy project, and a company owned by a businessman from Azerbaijan.The owner of the Dubai company is unknown, and it appears to have no trading activity. Emails obtained by the investigators showed correspondence between representatives for Mizzi, who was energy minister at the time, saying that 17 Black was to be one of the “target clients” of a Panama company of which he was the beneficiary.Responding to the allegations, a spokesman for Mizzi said his Panama company – created after he entered office – was wound up without ever having traded. It never held a bank account and had been settled into a trust, which was established for the benefit of his family. He said there was “no connection” between Mizzi and the Dubai company.Schembri, who is the owner of printing and recycling businesses founded before he became an employee of the government, stated this week that 17 Black had been included in “draft business plans” for his group as a potential client, but that in the event no transactions were ever recorded with the company. Schembri said he had “no knowledge of the transfers referred to, nor any knowledge of the alleged payment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2769da8326932c5eaaeeaa92da6132babc2396f0/0_129_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e677c45452676e2b99b51ad821431be","title":"no joke have chinas censors gone too far with ban on humour app","story":"End of Neihan Duanzi, which united strangers around funny memes, has driven users underground where they openly question controls over societyThere is a not-so-secret club in China. Members find each other in traffic by honking their horn – one long honk, followed by two short ones. Others identify each other by completing nonsensical couplets: “The son of heaven covers the tiger” – to which the correct response is “chicken stew with mushrooms”.They call themselves duanyou after the app Neihan Duanzi, or “implied jokes”, where until recently some 30 million users could watch short videos, comedy sketches and follow dirty jokes and memes. Fans also organise offline meet-ups. At one gathering in Hunan province earlier this month, a group posed in a parking lot with little red flags and a sign describing themselves as the “duanyou coalition”.China’s media regulator on 10 April ordered Neihan Duanzi’s parent company and one of the country’s fastest-growing internet companies, Bytedance, to shut down the app because of its “vulgar” content. It was one of several news apps to be removed from online stores or shuttered this month.The group’s unofficial song, On Earth, a ballad about life’s struggles, has been censored. Cities from Shanghai to Changde in Hunan province have placed restrictions on honking. Authorities have advised news outlets not to report on fan gatherings. The founder and CEO of Toutiao, the news platform where Neihan Duanzi was first hosted, issued a public apology for failing to “promote positive energy and grasp correct guidance of public opinion”.The app’s closure and subsequent restrictions offer more evidence of how China’s censorship is moving beyond politically sensitive topics to seemingly benign content like entertainment and humour. It is also a campaign more likely to cause backlash among the general public, observers say. In a country where topics from human rights to Winnie the Pooh, a nickname for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are routinely censored, it is the closure of a joke app that has riled citizens most in years.For some Duanzi fans, the app doesn’t just provide an escape from the tedium of daily life but a sense of belonging. Users quip back and forth, referencing inside jokes and phrases only other duanyou would know. The code phrase “the son of heaven covers the tiger” is a saying used by bandits in a popular Chinese novel from the 1950s.In real life, duanyou groups get together for dinners, go rafting, hold barbecues, sing karaoke, or just hang out by their cars. Some get involved in local causes, raising money. In a post on a Duanzi forum this week, one user asked other duanyou to drive their cars to his wedding in order to beep and cheer him on.“Neihan Duanzi contains normal people’s happiness ... Duanyou make fun of each other ... but if you meet another offline, he will give you a cigarette. Strangers can have a meal together like old friends,” a journalist wrote on the Chinese tech news site PingWest last year.Now, some duanyou are moving underground. They’ve started chat groups on platforms like Telegram, which can only be used via VPN in China. They complain about the Duanzi ban and talk openly about politics and tightening controls over Chinese society. Others are in private WeChat or QQ groups for duanyou. Duanzi videos are still circulating online.“I’ve been a Neihan Duanzi user for two years and never even thought of putting a sticker on my car. Occasionally I’d honk at a duanyou’s car. But when Duanzi was censored, I felt a certain pain in my heart, like someone had taken my child from me,” one user wrote on 12 April in a Duanzi Telegram group that has more than 2,000 members.By shutting down Neihan Duanzi, authorities may have targeted a segment of Chinese society for whom this app is especially important. While the app’s appeal is broad, it seems especially popular among those with less education, from China’s less-developed cities. Teng Wei, a cultural studies scholar based in Guangzhou, calls them China’s “new poor”, a group defined not by their income so much as by what they don’t or cannot buy.According to Teng, they are often young people born in rural areas who have relocated to larger cities and who, in between the village and the city, lack a sense of identity outside of virtual spaces like Duanzi. Videos on the app, filmed and uploaded from all over the country, often feature scenarios and skits in China’s poorer second- and third-tier cities.In one popular Duanzi video, a man in an unbuttoned shirt with long hair pulled into a messy pony tail comes across his girlfriend walking with another man, much more smartly dressed. His girlfriend proceeds to break up with him because her new beau, she says, “pays more attention” and has bought her a BMW and an iPhone X.“Being poor no longer means you don’t have property or a job it simply means you are not consuming,” Teng wrote in a 2016 essay about fans of another video app, Kuaishou, whose following she believes is similar to that of Duanzi. That app was also singled out this month for inappropriate content.By censoring this group, Beijing also risks losing a support base: young people known as “little pink” for their sympathies with China’s ruling Communist party, whose official colour is red. Videos and content on the app are often more nationalistically skewed.“Overall, they seemed to be aligned with the government and now they face this situation,” said Zhou Fengsuo, a Chinese human rights activist who was a leader in China’s 1989 democracy protests and is now based in the US. “This is a pretty common pattern in China where people keep going with their regular life until suddenly one day you are the victim of arbitrary rules.” Observers say it will be difficult to fully disband these communities, who are still looking for an outlet. “Soon another app will come out,” Teng said. “Consumers are always looking for something new.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf59ba0d46e7b0efbfe44da5fd450cc61544d255/0_317_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27e13d9e34e7d404e8b67a2f5dd2dff5","title":"south africa riots force president to leave commonwealth summit","story":"Cyril Ramaphosa travels to North West province where police have fired rubber bullets during protests over alleged corruption and failing servicesSouth African police have fired rubber bullets at protesters as violent riots forced President Cyril Ramaphosa to cut short his attendance at the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in London.Shops were looted, roads were blocked and vehicles set alight in North West province on Friday in unrest over alleged government corruption and poor public services. At least 23 people were arrested and one man was reported to have died in sporadic violence that erupted this week in Mahikeng, the provincial capital.Ramaphosa, who came to power in February, called for calm following more than six hours of talks with local leaders in the city of Mahikeng. North West province has been a hotbed of unrest due to boiling frustration over lack of housing, health services and jobs.Police fired rubber bullets as protesters hid behind cardboard sheets, while roads were littered with burning tyres and bricks that had been thrown through the air.At the end of the talks Ramaphosa appealed for an end to the unrest, promising a “speedy” resolution of the crisis. “Let us be calm, let us return to a position of normalcy as we address this matter and reach finality on it,” he said in an address broadcast live from the city.He said he had been made to understand during the talks that the unrest had been sparked by concerns over the position of the provincial premier, corruption and governance.“These are matters that are serious enough” to warrant broad consultation in the party and the national government “on an urgent basis”, he said.“We are going to act as speedily as possible to address each of the issues that have been raised,” he added.The trigger for the unrest was reportedly the death on Tuesday of two patients at a health clinic that was closed due to a month-long dispute over health workers’ salaries and contracts.Much of the anger has been directed at Supra Mahumapelo, the provincial premier, who is accused of involvement in graft scandals that have engulfed the ruling ANC party.The border to neighbouring Botswana was closed due to the violence, while schools, shops, offices and government services across North West province were shut.Local residents said foreign-owned shops were the first to be targeted by looters. “Very poor people are in dire need. Those people looted foreigners’ shops,” said Leveticus Molosankwe, 43.“They have taken advantage of the political situation as people plead for the removal of Mahumapelo. This has been simmering for months.”Thapelo Galeboe, member of the local Communist party branch, said the premier ruled “like an emperor” in the province. “The health system has completely collapsed. Hospitals are filthy. Families close to the premier have benefited in a very corrupt manner from tenders,” he said.Ramaphosa took over as leader of the ruling ANC in December and subsequently replaced Jacob Zuma as national president. Zuma’s nine-year tenure saddled South Africa with weak growth, ballooning national debt, depressed investor confidence and record unemployment.The ANC forced Zuma from office in February largely due to his mounting legal challenges and multiple corruption scandals, and the party has distanced itself from its former leader.Ramaphosa has vowed to crack down on government corruption, which he has admitted is a serious problem, and improve South Africa’s ability to attract foreign investment.Zuma appeared in court earlier this month at a preliminary hearing on graft charges that he denies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3459762.1524066741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"getting up close and digital with nature s miniature life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBumblebee at broad bean flowers. Illustration: Michael VineyWith a teenager’s devotion to a wild idea, I once turned the family greenhouse into a photographic darkroom. It was the only uncontested space, and its cardboard blackout was proof against all but the brightest chinks of starlight. My first enlarger, conjured from a mysterious, fatherly deal in the pub, was an Edwardian antique of mahogany and brass. It stretched horizontally along the potting bench, the bellows extending on tracks. Its fist-size lens threw a diamond-sharp image, once I had managed to sandwich my modest square of film where the big glass plate of a negative used to go.Making a print was slow, messy and laborious, involving smelly chemicals. As I became more ambitious, the cost of a perfect 10 x 8 print, its darks rich and velvety, could be quite high. But the feeling of accomplishment, of solitary, magical creativity, was incomparable. Moving a digital image from camera to computer screen, all with a click or two, misses out on a whole slice of youthful fulfilment.My first camera, an aged twin-lens Voigtlander, could not focus nearer than a metre. With wooden tripod tied to my crossbar, I cycled off into the countryside for landscapes and quaint corners of stockbroker villages while haunted by Ansel Adams’s wild and wonderful boulders and peaks of Yosemite, borrowed from the town library.Half a century on, in the digital age, I also delight in a different scale of nature – its miniatures – as the rich flow of images from readers arrives at “Eye on Nature”. The capacity of smartphone cameras to get in close, often to a hand’s breadth of the subject, has embraced the beauty and interest of the single flower or woodland mushroom, the single beetle or bumblebee, the inidual butterfly or moth, and (I sometimes shrink to see) the poised and solitary spider. Along with the images comes the quest to know more, which Ethna tries to satisfy.Among Europe’s finest close-up photographers is Dr Robert Thompson, who is based in Banbridge, Co Down. An entomologist, he knows what everything is and where it’s likely to be. I met up with him once in the dunes along the shore and marvelled at the range of Nikon hardware clustered weightily across his chest: if not this camera, then that one, and whichever lens, tripod, knee pads or ancillary gadget needed for the shot.Thompson’s classic work has already been seen in weighty volumes of dragonflies, butterflies and moths published by the Ulster Museum. He has now produced a masterly guide, Close-up and Macro Photography: Its Art and Fieldcraft Techniques. It’s not cheap – €41 even in the hefty, large-format paperback – but it is visually thrilling and technically exhaustive.Thompson’s life as a professional natural history photographer means marketing flawless photos with impact and a personal style: “branding”, as he puts it. Along with the right exposure, white balance, colour temperature and expertise with clinical software comes an artistic gift for an image that draws a gasp.The fieldcraft offered by Thompson, moving from one habitat to another, can be beguilingly practical, as in keeping one’s head off the skyline while stalking dragonflies perched at a pond, or searching for the one mushroom the slugs haven’t got to.Wind and weather count as much as knowing where and when to look, and blue-sky, breezy days are definitely not the best. There are flexible yokes to hold a flower still (among them the wonderful “Wimberley Plamp”), tripods that sprawl obligingly flat on the ground, and screens that diffuse the overly harsh light of bright sun.Early morning finds the light kindest and insects still torpidly waiting to be warmed into life. When they’re flying, a light shower of rain can bring them down to the leaves and add sparkling drops to a flower or a dragonfly’s wing. In winter, soft mist can bejewel a spider’s web or frost coat a seed head or berry in diamonds.Close-up and “macro” photography are not the same: the latter means images often greatly enlarged from life. Not everyone enjoys inspecting the glaze on a wasp’s eyeball. Thompson usually settles for doubling the size, perhaps with telephoto lens and extension tube. If there is a special style to his work, it shows up well in his exquisite studies of day-flying moths pretending to be tree bark and of ineffably elegant caterpillars and dragonflies, or flowers showing off their stamens.His scope widens to lichens, fungi, rock pools and streams (bring your own aquarium and put everything back where you found it). And given his ruthless perfectionism – every hair glistening, every petal immaculate – it is reassuring to be told that smartphone and mobile phone cameras can often yield “acceptable” images.

File photograph:  CollinsVeteran women’s rights campaigner and journalist Nell McCafferty is a reluctant supporter of abortion, a conference has heard.She said she could not answer the question. “But it’s not that I’m unable – I am unwilling to face some of the facts about abortion.”The writer and broadcaster, who participated in the 1971 “contraceptives train” to Belfast to protest against the prohibition on the sale of contraceptives in the Republic, said “the pro-lifers are right” that allowing terminations at the 12-weeks stage of pregnancy means the dismembering of babies in the womb.She said the Irish women’s movement had demanded contraception to end what former minister Nuala Fennell called the “nightmare of unremitting pregnancy”.However, Ms McCafferty said: “There is no conversation these days about abortion.”She recalled the 1983 abortion referendum campaign, when “the pro-lifers were going around showing videos and telling us all that babies are being dismembered in the womb through abortion.She said that in an abortion “they scrape the contents of the womb. The pro-lifers are right. Out come the wee arms and legs, and I thought: ‘Oh God, is this what I am advocating?’”When asked, Ms McCafferty confirmed that she would be voting to repeal the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits abortion, in the forthcoming referendum on the issue.Ms McCafferty was speaking during a discussion entitled: “Celebrating 100 years of the vote for Irish women: Would the Irish suffragettes be happy with the progress to date in securing equality?”The 74-year-old said she was part of the last generation that had mothers who worked full-time in the home. She asked who was now celebrating pregnancy and motherhood.She said couples were out working and were exhausted when they came home, and could not afford the children they had. She said: “Abortion was beyond our consciousness and here we are, 100 years after slaughters like the Somme and places like that, offering abortion on request.”Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3469882.1524308849!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bertie ahern walks out of interview when asked about mahon tribunal","story":"Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern ended an interview with German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle after questions of his testimony at the Mahon Tribunal were raised.

Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern has walked out on an interview after he was questioned about the circumstances of his resignation in 2008.In an interview on German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, hosted by journalist Tim Sebastian, Mr Ahern was reluctant to answer questions about his downfall as taoiseach.In the wake of allegations published in The  in 2006 citing Mr Ahern had received money from a millionaire businessman while Minister for Finance in 1993, Mr Ahern vowed to “clear his name”.Sebastian asked him if he achieved this, to which Mr Ahern replied:“Yes I did, I’m quite happy I’ve cleared my name.”Following the publication of these allegations in 2006, Mr Ahern was re-elected to a third term as taoiseach before resigning in 2008 after coming under increasing political pressure.In its final report, published in 2012, the Mahon tribunal found that Ahern had given untrue evidence about the source of over £215,000 lodged in bank accounts connected to him.When asked about this outcome, Mr Ahern says: “The tribunal gave its views and I gave my evidence and I was very happy with the situation I gave and it’s over now and that’s it.”Becoming increasingly irritated with the direction the interview was going, Mr Ahern said:“I’ve dealt with that issue and I’m not saying anything more about it again.

Photograph Nick BradshawTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has hit out at claims by the No side in the abortion referendum campaign. Mr Varadkar said if the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution is repealed, the Government will introduce a safe, regulated doctor-led system in Ireland. The Eighth Amendment was inserted into the Constitution after a referendum in 1983. The amendment guarantees to protect as far as practicable the equal right to life of the unborn and the mother. It prohibits abortion in almost all cases. Voters go to the polls on May 25th to decide whether or not to remove the provision from the Constitution and introduce legislation allowing for abortion in certain circumstances and without restriction in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.Responding to some of the No campaign claims, Mr Varadkar said some assertions during 1995 orce referendum proved to be false.“In 1995 and I remember it well, there was a referendum on orce in this country that was passed by the narrowest of margins. At the time there were placards that read ‘orce aborts marriage’,” he said. The Taoiseach was joined by colleagues in Dublin on Saturday to launch the Fine Gael Vote Yes campaign.“We were told that if we introduced orce in Ireland we would soon have a orce rate like Britain, of thirty or forty per cent. But marriage in Ireland was not destroyed and in the years that followed the numbers of Irish people who got orced did not skyrocket. All we did was give some people a second chance at happiness,” he said. “When there was a referendum on marriage equality the same fears were raised. We were told marriage equality would wreck marriage and redefine it but three years later marriage in Ireland seems to be doing just fine,” he said. Referring to a No campaign assertion on one of its referendum posters, Mr Varadkar added: “If we really believe the Eighth Amendment will result in five times as many women having an abortion - what does that say about us? “ Do we seriously believe there are large number of women in this country who give birth every year and will suddenly decide to have an abortion just because it is legal to do so? If that is the case we think very little of our women and think very little of ourselves,” he added. “We should be a country in which we trust women and trust doctors to decide on what’s right,” said Mr Varadkar. “In Ireland we’ve spent much of the last few years atoning for historic wrongs that were done to women. Truth be told we still wrong women today. The Eighth Amendment does not prevent abortion, nine women travel to countries each day to end their pregnancies,” he said. He said if the referendum is passed “there will not be unrestricted abortion”.He said there will be a waiting period of 72 hours which does not exist in the UK “to allow for reflection” and the woman will receive counselling. “In the Ireland of 2018 we still export our problems and import our solutions and in the Ireland of 2018 we still turn a cold shoulder to our sisters, daughters, nieces and colleagues,” he said. “If the referendum does not pass, nothing can change for Irish women. 3-400 women will continue to travel abroad and the number of women taking abortion bills will rise in their home without medical supervision, It is hard to believe there hasn’t been the tragic death of a woman as result of taking abortion pills,” he said. Minister for Health Simon Harris said the choice being put to voters is not whether they are pro- or anti-abortion as abortion is “unregulated and unsafe” with a lack of medical support.“The choice is do you wish to make the situation in Ireland safe and regulated because it is currently neither,” he said. He asked those on the No side who said there are “better answers” than the Government’s proposals on abortion “to publish those better answers.”Fine Gael referendum co-ordinator, Josepha Madigan said it is 35 years since the introduction of the Eighth Amendment and said “its deep flaws have repeatedly been seen since then”.Ms Madigan said she is a practicing Catholic but that the Eighth Amendment is “medieval in its import and cruel in its practical implication”. She said it has done nothing to stop women availing of abortion services and forces women to go overseas “like cattle.” Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Pyongyang reveals plans to close its nuclear test site ahead of landmark Korean summitLeaders of ruling BJP party reject claims that internet is a modern-day Western inventionThe stakes are high for Moon Jae-in at next week\u0026rsquos inter-Korean summitTwo Koreas discussing plans to announce official end to military conflict, newspaper suggestsXi Jinping tells foreign dignitaries that recent change on term limits has been \u0026lsquomisinterpreted\u0026rsquoLawyer for victim\u0026rsquos family says she has received death threats for taking the caseFamily members said to be vetted by immigration and health officials, and given necessitiesOutrage mounts following alleged gang rape and murder of eight-year-old girlFirst naval manoeuvres by China in sensitive waters since 2015 sure to infuriate TaiwanEfforts to disrupt police inquiry deepen fears that religious nationalists acting with impunityJournalists who report on India\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosand mafia\u0026rsquo are frequent victims of violenceTrump says planned meeting with Kim Jong Un will focus on North Korea\u0026rsquos nuclear weaponsDriver reportedly lost control of vehicle when speeding on mountain roadCIA chief Mike Pompeo is leading preparations, CNN reportsSalman Khan (52) sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for 1998 offenceDisgraced ex-president Park Geun-hye\u0026rsquos 24-year sentence no surprise to populaceCase exposed dubious links between government and the \u0026lsquochaebol\u0026rsquo conglomeratesTokyo Letter: As they run out of things to do, officers are becoming more inventive\u0026lsquoDesperate measures\u0026rsquo include redrawing electoral map and \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo crackdownThe women were told to leave a sumo ring while treating an official who had collapsedThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3469873.1524293792!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea suspends nuclear missile tests to pursue peace","story":"North Korea will immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap its nuclear test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un announces North Korea will stop nuclear and missile tests. Photograph: EPAKCNA North Korea will immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap its nuclear test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace, the North’s state media said on Saturday, ahead of planned summits with South Korea and the United States.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country no longer needed to conduct nuclear tests or intercontinental ballistic missile tests because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.North Korea said that to create an “international environment favourable” for its economy, it would “facilitate close contact and active dialogue” with neighbouring countries and the international community.It was the first time Kim directly addressed his position on North Korea’s nuclear weapons programmes ahead of planned summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next week and with US President Donald Trump in late May or early June.The pledge to halt the development of nuclear weapons, initiated by his grandfather and continued by his father, would mean a significant reversal for the young, third-generation leader, now 34, who has staked his security on his nuclear arsenal and spent years celebrating such weapons as an integral part of his regime’s legitimacy and power.A testing freeze and commitment to close a test site alone would fall short of Washington’s demand that Pyongyang completely dismantle all of its nuclear weapons and missiles.But announcing the concessions now, rather than during summit meetings, shows Kim is serious about denuclearisation talks, experts say.“The northern nuclear test ground of the DPRK will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test,” KCNA said after Kim convened a plenary session of the Central Committee of the ruling Worker’s Party on Friday.The North’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).The Pyunggye-ri site in northern North Korea is its only known nuclear test site, where all of its six underground tests were conducted, including the last, its largest-ever detonation, in September.“We will concentrate all efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of people’s living through the mobilisation of all human and material resources of the country,” KCNA said.Trump welcomed the statement and said he looked forward to a summit with Kim.“North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit,” Trump said on Twitter.“Progress being made for all!” he said in a later tweet.South Korea said the North’s decision signified “meaningful” progress toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and would create favourable conditions for successful meetings with it and the United States.China, North Korea’s sole major ally which has nevertheless been frustrated by its defiant development of weapons, welcomed the announcement saying it would ease tension and promote denuclearisation.“The Chinese side believes that North Korea’s decision will help ameliorate the situation on the peninsula,” a foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said in a statement.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also welcomed the North Korean statement but said it must lead to action.“What’s important is that this leads to complete, verifiable denuclearisation. I want to emphasise this,” Abe told reporters.The United States, Japan and South Korea have historically been the main targets of North Korea’s anger.“We’re all looking for evidence that Kim is really serious about negotiations, and announcements like this certainly suggest he is, and that he is trying to make clear to the world that he is,” said David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.North Korea has said its nuclear and missile programmes are necessary deterrents against US hostility. It has conducted numerous missile tests with the aim of being able to hit the United States with a nuclear bomb.The tests and escalating rhetoric between Trump and Kim raised fears of war until, in a New Year’s speech, the North Korean leader called for reduced military tensions.He sent a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South in February, leading to warmer ties with the South.Nam Sung-wook, professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul, said it was “sensational” that Kim had personally declared plans to suspend nuclear development, but added that his remarks left a number of questions.“It still does not seem clear if it means whether the North will just not pursue further development of its nuclear programmes in the future, or whether they will completely shut down ‘all’ nuclear facilities. And what are they going to do with their existing nuclear weapons?” Nam said.South Korean President Moon said on Thursday North Korea had expressed a commitment to “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula, and had not attached conditions, but Washington had remained wary and vowed to maintain “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang.The United States said on Thursday that in the run-up to Trump’s planned summit with Kim, countries should continue to put financial and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang to surrender its banned nuclear weapons.Many US officials and experts doubt Kim’s sincerity about denuclearising, viewing the recent flurry of diplomacy as a ploy to win relief from economic sanctions.Ordinary South Koreans were also cautious after the latest announcement.“I don’t think we can completely trust anything North Korea says because North Korea isn’t a normal country,” said Kim Han-nuri (23) out in Seoul on a sunny spring morning.UN Security Council sanctions imposed on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and extended over the past decade have aimed to deny it a considerable amount of international trade, banning critical exports such as coal, iron ore, seafood, textile while limiting oil imports.That has threatened the policy of “byungjin” - simultaneous military and economic development - that Kim Jong Un has adopted since taking power in late 2011.“Easing tensions and cooperating with the international community is critical if Kim wanted to advance the economy,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute think-tank south of Seoul.Koh Yu-hwan, professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said he did not believe Pyongyang was ready to give up its existing nuclear weapons and missiles.“Kim is just saying that now that the nuclear development is complete, he will put all the efforts toward building an economy,” Koh said.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window   April 21, 2018Airline regulators order inspections after woman partially pulled out of plane in US Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Bush - Barbara\u0027s husband of 73 years - their son George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as other former senior officials.Former President George H. W.

Suggestions have included St George\u0027s Day - April 23.With Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Kate gave birth just over five weeks after going on maternity leave. She went on maternity leave for her third child on March 22, so this suggests the baby might put in an appearance around April 27 or 28.Both Prince George, four, and Princess Charlotte, two, are thought to have been born slightly late: in 2015 the Duchess of Cambridge let slip that her due date was towards the end of April, however Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May. This might mean another longer-than-average pregnancy is on the cards for the Duchess.The new arrival will come just weeks before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot on May 19, hopefully giving Kate a few days to recover.Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, hold their new born son GeorgeParking restrictions are in place outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London in preparation for the birth.Crowd barriers are set up on the street outside to accommodate the television crews, journalists and photographers who will be present as she goes into labour. Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born at the Lindo Wing.The private wing of the NHS hospital charges £5,215 for the first 24 hours if a baby is born naturally, or £6,745 for a Caesarean section, plus £1,155 for the deluxe package for each additional night.Royal baby | Inside the Lindo WingThe \u0027s Anna Maxted had all three of her children there, and describes the rooms as basic, but the care as first-class.When the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Princess Charlotte in 2015, contingency plans were put in place. If the Duchess unexpectedly went into labour while visiting her parents in Bucklebury, she would have been taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, while if she went into labour at Anmer Hall, the couple\u0027s country residence in Norfolk, she would have given birth at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King\u0027s Lynn.The Duke and Duchess have chosen solidly traditional royal names for their children in the past, making it likely they will reference previous monarchs this time as well.Alice, Mary, Alexandra or Victoria for a girl, or Frederick, James, Arthur or Philip for a boy are good bets.There is one former king who\u0027s highly unlikely to ever have another royal namesake: King John. That’s because in his 17-year reign he managed to so sully his name it\u0027s pretty much been removed from royal circulation.Not only was he exceptionally rapacious and cruel (he had a penchant for starving his enemies to death), John was also one of the most cowardly and incompetent scoundrels to sit on the throne.Prince George in JuneThe couple\u0027s first child George will in time become King George VII, following a tradition dating back to German-born George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain who acceded to the throne in 1714. The last was the Queen\u0027s father George VI who died in 1952 but was known to his family as Bertie.Among the previous monarchs to have had the name is George III - on the throne from 1760 to 1820 - who is predominantly remembered for losing the American colonies and his sanity. However, the Prince of Wales has previously disclosed that he is the king he most respects, describing him as a good man who was simply misunderstood.Princess Charlotte in JulyThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge honoured both royal tradition and family ties by naming their second child Charlotte.The name’s royal pedigree includes Queen Charlotte, the wife of George III, who bore him 15 children and helped found Kew Gardens. Queen Charlotte’s \u0026amp Chelsea Hospital, which is named after her, is part of the same NHS Trust as St Mary’s Hospital Paddington, where the private Lindo Wing is situated.Her granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Wales, who married on May 2, the day the new Princess Charlotte was born, died in childbirth in 1817 at the age of just 21. She was the only child of George, Prince of Wales, who would go on to become King George IV.Charlotte also happens to be the middle name of the Duchess’s sister, Pippa Middleton, and goes back in her family to her paternal great-great-great-grandmother Charlotte Ablett, born in 1825 and therefore possibly named for Princess Charlotte.The new royal baby will be fifth in line to the throne, behind the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. It means Prince Harry will drop down to sixth in line, and every other member of the Royal family will be one step further away from the throne.Because of recent changes to the laws governing succession, the baby\u0027s sex will make no difference, as boys no longer have precedence over girls.If the change hadn\u0027t been made and the third baby were a boy, he would be fifth in line instead of Princess Charlotte - however that will now not be the case.The new baby will be an HRH and a Prince or Princess of Cambridge - thanks to the Queen who stepped in ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth to ensure all William\u0027s children had fitting titles.Unlikely. It\u0027s rare, but not unheard of, for a third-born royal in direct succession to become king or queen.This Cambridge sibling will live their life happy in the knowledge they will not be expected to wear the crown, leaving that role to older brother George.William IV, a Hanoverian king who ruled from 1830 to 1837, was a third child - of George III and Queen Charlotte. He acceded to the throne when he outlived his older brothers, George IV, who died without an heir, and Frederick, Duke of York.Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are believed to have been born by a natural delivery, meaning the Duchess of Cambridge will presumably be planning to have a natural birth this time as well.In 2015 Pat O\u0027Brien, a consultant obstetrician at University College Hospital, said that because of the speed with which the Princess Charlotte was delivered after the Duchess was admitted to hospital, it is likely that she went into labour naturally.From Princess Charlotte to the Queen: The Royal Family as toddlers through the agesHe said: \u0026quotThe fact that she went into hospital at around 6am and had the baby by 8.34am would not imply that she was induced at all.\u0026quotSecond time labours tend to be quicker than first time labours. Everything tends to go faster. The dilation stage is quicker, the pushing stage is usually quicker and easier as well, and the baby comes out more quickly. You would expect it to be an easier labour anyway.\u0026quotThe medical team in charge of safely delivering Princess Charlotte was led by Guy Thorpe-Beeston, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Royal Household.Mr Thorpe-Beeston, an obstetrician who specialises in high-risk pregnancies, has a private Harley Street practice and is a consultant at the Portland private hospital and at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in the NHS.A Cambridge graduate, he worked at King\u0027s College Hospital in London before becoming a consultant in foetal medicine at Chelsea and Westminster in 1996.The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s best maternity fashion moments...He was assisted by Alan Farthing, Surgeon Gynaecologist to the Queen, who was the fiance of the television presenter Jill Dando at the time of her murder in 1999, and has been part of the Queen\u0027s medical household since 2008.In 2014 Sir Marcus Setchell, the recently retired surgeon gynaecologist to the Queen who delivered Prince George, told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: “What happened in labour is an entirely private matter, but I do think there are certain situations when someone is giving birth that it’s important…to have a specialist…in the same room to deal with anything that’s immediately going to be wrong.”After the Queen, other members of the Royal family and the Middleton family have been told the good news, the royal communications team will email media organisations with the sex, weight and timing of the birth.Moments later the news will be announced via royal Twitter and Instagram accounts before a traditional paper announcement is placed on an easel outside Buckingham Palace.The age-old custom of placing a paper proclamation for the public to see at the Queen\u0027s London residence took place when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born.A brief formal announcement - on foolscap-sized paper set in a dark wooden frame - will be placed on an ornate golden easel on the forecourt of the Palace.It will confirm the sex of the baby and the time of birth, but will give little else away, other than usually revealing that the baby has been \u0026quotsafely delivered\u0026quot and mother and child are \u0026quotdoing well\u0026quot.It used to be hand-written, but is now typed. It will also be signed at the hospital by the doctors who tended to the duchess, and then ferried back to the Palace by car.Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a daughter at 8.34am.\u0026mdash Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 2, 2015After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess left hospital the next day, while she left the hospital to go home on the same day after giving birth to Princess Charlotte.But the length of the Duchess\u0027s hospital stay this time around will be entirely down to how she is feeling, so there is no guarantee we will see the baby within 24 hours of its birth. The Duke and Duchess are expected to leave the Lindo Wing by the front door to give the waiting media the chance to take the photographs that will no doubt adorn the front pages of newspapers the next day.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0026#39s Hospital in London in 2015, with Princess CharlotteAfter the birth of Princess Charlotte, the Duke and Duchess spent the first nights of her life at Kensington Palace before driving north to their country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, where they were likely joined there by the Duchess\u0027s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, who often stayed over to help look after Prince George.However, the family permanently relocated to Kensington Palace last year, after deciding Prince George should be schooled in London, so it\u0027s unlikely that they\u0027ll head back to Norfolk for a while.The names given to royal babies are not usually revealed straight away, and the public is often left guessing for several days.William and Kate took two days to announce both George and Charlotte\u0027s names, informing the Queen of their choice beforehand.Mike and Zara Tindall used Twitter to unveil their daughter\u0027s name six days after she was born in 2014, with proud dad Mike tweeting: \u0026quotFor everyone who has asked what our daughter\u0027s name is, it\u0027s Mia Grace Tindall.\u0026quotWhen Princess Beatrice was born in 1988, it was two weeks before her name was known.In 1982, the Prince and Princess of Wales waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing Prince William\u0027s name.The Prince of Wales\u0027s name, however, remained a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his christening in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace in December 1948.Prince George to start school with mum and dad by his sideThey have on previous occasions: after the birth of Princess Charlotte, the Duke took two weeks\u0027 statutory paternity leave from his job as an air ambulance pilot, which he quit in July 2017 to become a full time royal, and the Duchess took maternity leave from her official royal duties.After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess was back in action after five weeks, joining her husband to start the Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon. However, she maintained a light workload for several months after both births.As well as having a full-time nanny and plenty of help from the Middletons in 2015, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hired another temporary nanny to help them through the first weeks of Princess Charlotte\u0027s life.The couple were determined to manage without professional help when Prince George was born, but he was not a good sleeper and the Duchess became exhausted after countless sleepless nights.Prince George, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince George\u0026#39s nanny, Maria BorralloThey eventually accepted they needed help, and hired Spaniard Maria Borrallo from the world-famous Norland nanny agency when Prince George was seven months old.When Princess Charlotte was born they reportedly made arrangements through Norland for a maternity nurse to work full-time for at least three months, to get them through the most difficult period of their new baby’s life.The Duchess of Cambridges best jewellery momentsAlmost certainly. Perhaps the most tasteful souvenir will be a commemorative £5 coin that is likely to be a hit with collectors.When Prince George was born the Royal Mint produced 10,000 solid silver coins, which cost £80 each, and 2,013 22 carat gold sovereigns, priced at £800. They all sold out within days. Babies born on the same day as Prince George were also entitled to a free \u0026quotlucky\u0026quot silver penny minted for the occasion.When Princess Charlotte was born the Royal Mint produced four coins, ranging in price from £13 to £1,800.The Royal Collection Trust, which runs the official souvenir shops at royal palaces, is likely to bring out its own range of commemorative china. When Prince George was born, official plates, cups and other chinaware was on sale just two days later.The usual unofficial range of tea towels, postcards and crockery will no doubt follow.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyThe Queen celebrates her 92nd birthday with a concert at the Royal Albert HallComment: If the world feels good about Brexit, why don’t we?Chemical weapons inspectors enter Douma two weeks after attackBlood testing at dinner parties takes health awareness to new levelSir Edward Heath\u0026#39s supporters criticise police chief for \u0026#39u-turn\u0026#39 on inquiryReal ale drinkers reject Camra\u0026#39s bid to support lager for the first timeChristians claim they are being forced out of Pakistani city by Isil violence 4,000 paedophiles recalled to prison after being released by parole boardDonald Trump says his personal lawyer Michael Cohen will not \u0026#39flip\u0026#39Past presidents, family and friends bid farewell to Barbara Bush at her funeralRobots interviewing graduates for jobs at top city firms as students practice how to impress AIAfter his \u0026#39fire and forget\u0026#39 strikes on Syria, Iran may be next in Trump\u0026#39s sightsComment: The EU believes it can push Britain around over Northern Ireland.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

The enquiries are still relevant and should continue.”The conference reacted in shock as it became clear Mr Jones was announcing his resignation.He said: “In any normal political career, you expect to be put through the ringer, and even have your integrity challenged.“I don’t think anyone can know what these last few months have been like. No-one that is, apart from Lisa and the kids.“They have carried me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them, and it is time for me to think about what’s fair for them.“And so, this will be the last Welsh Labour conference I address as party leader.“I intend – as I’ve always maintained – to be here to give every answer to every question. But I intend to stand down in the autumn, allowing for a new first minister to take their place by the end of this year.“At that point it will make sense to have a fresh start. For my family, for my party and for my country.”He added: “I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved together so far. The election victories. The landmark legislation. A better deal for nurses, for students and our businesses. Putting Wales on the map.”He will stand down in December.Jack Sargeant at the Welsh Assembly by-election count (PA)At the end of his speech, he received a standing ovation, the BBC reported.Reacting to the announcement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “I would like to thank Carwyn Jones for his service as leader of Welsh Labour and first minister of Wales.“Carwyn has led Welsh Labour to achieve unprecedented electoral success, forming two Labour Welsh Assembly governments.“Over the last nine years he has stood up to Tory austerity and stood up for the people of Wales as a strong voice for devolution and democracy.”Welsh Secretary Christina Rees said: “Carwyn’s contribution to both Welsh Labour and Welsh public life has been immense. His government has improved the life chances of people across our country, and as his speech today showed, continues to deliver for those people who need us most.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

It contained several anonymous case studies of the problems facing the Windrush generation.The Labour MP David Lammy, who has been a leading campaigner for those members of the Windrush generation experiencing difficulties, told The Independent: “It is utterly extraordinary that the Home Office was clearly aware of the impact that their pernicious policies would have, yet ignored all the warnings and impact assessments.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

The home secretary has recognised the huge contribution they have made to our society, and has apologised unreservedly to them.“The vast majority will already have documentation that proves their right to be here. For those that don’t, we have established a new dedicated team to quickly help them get the documentation they need and ensure this is resolved as soon as possible.”Email cannot be used.

But the feisty feline navigated the long journey back to his original home in Raleigh, North Carolina, so that he could be with them again.Rather than welcoming him back, his original family took him to a local animal shelter and asked if he could be euthanised.The \u0027happiest cats in the world\u0027 might just be in MoroccoHowever, instead of putting him down, the shelter made a call to animal protection charity, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), who took him into their shelter to be rehomed.When Toby first arrived at their shelter he was “laid back and “people-friendly”, but not too keen on other cats, the charity\u0027s communications manager Tara Lyn told The Independent.He has now found a home with mum, Michele, and her children, the charity said separately earlier this week.  He also has two other cats around the house to keep him company and his family says they are “getting along well”.Ms Lyn described Toby’s story as “heart-breaking”, adding that they did not know all the details about what the family asked for him to be put down but he got a second chance.Toby was rejected by the family he walked 12 miles to be with (Jenny Winston Photography)Toby the cat settles into his temporary home at the SPCA shelter in Raleigh (SPCA)Toby is infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which means that his immune system is weakened, but this should not prevent him from living a long, otherwise healthy life as long as he has people around him who look out for signs of secondary symptoms, and take him for regular appointments with a vet.Toby with his new mum Michele (SPCA)“If people are moved by Toby’s story, we ask that they take action rather than just commenting on the story online,” Ms Lyn said. “Toby wouldn’t have the happy ending that he has now if we didn’t have volunteers, staff and the funding to do the work we do. We hope his story inspires people to make a donation, consider adopting from a shelter or becoming a volunteer. Or all three.”The creature seems to be adjusting to life with his new family pretty well, with his mum Michele telling the SPCA it is like “he’s always been here”.You can see lots of Toby pictures and keep up to date with his new family life on his Instagram pageThe cats of EssaouiraThe cats of EssaouiraThere’s no competition for food between the cats here – because there’s enough for everyone.

Neither did representatives for Mattel in Mexico.The Frida Kahlo Corporation, in an emailed statement, said: “It will continue its activities within the framework of respect for the law and in the exercise of its constitutional rights.”The corporation maintains it received the rights to the artist from Kahlo\u0027s niece Isolda Pineda.“Since the relatives of Isolda Pineda have not put forward their claim, within the period established by law and as indicated by the judge, these precautionary measures must be declared unsubstantiated in the coming hours,” the corporation said.Kahlo\u0027s image and her extensive body of work have been widely commercialised as the artist\u0027s popularity has grown.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Some consumers wondered whether the French meat industry was feeling threatened by the rise in popularity of vegan food others doubted that consumers would ever be confused.One said: This is ridiculous. I can tell you now no carnivore has ever bought veggie sausages or Quorn thinking they were buying meat.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Leaving the European Union also means taking back control of our borders and our trade.Mr Gove added: \u0026ldquoBeing able to sign our own free trade deals is a compelling and persuasive one.\u0026ldquoI know that when that case is put to the House of Commons it will rally Conservative MPs and others behind it.\u0026ldquoA case endorsed by 17.4 million people in the referendum and one the Government has pledged to honour.Labour\u0026rsquos Yvette Cooper and Tory Nicky Morgan have also now drafted a motion that urges Mrs May to include an \u0026ldquoeffective customs union in her Brexit negotiations.Senior Tories fear the latest reverse in the House of Lords could be the start of a series of defeats during the Lords Report Stage of the legislation, with a hardcore group of Remain-backing having tabled dozens more amendments.Analysis by the Change Britain pressure group has revealed that 10 fanatical Remain-backing peers have proposed a total of 338 amendments aimed at frustrating or even reversing the country\u0026rsquos departure from the EU.The research from the group, which wants a full break with Brussels, showed that Labour peer Lord Judd had tabled a massive 62 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is designed to transfer EU law into the UK to ensure a smooth Brexit process.Fellow Labour peer Lord Adonis had tabled 59 amendments while Lib Dem Lord Wallace of Tankerness was responsible for 49 of them.

If Diana had someone to love and cherish her like that, she\u0026rsquod still be here today, he said.Paul Burrell says Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are a \u0027perfect match\u0027                Meghan Markle is a phoney and wants to be like Diana claims brother...Harry and William both wanted bigger families says the former royal butlerWith her beside him, they can fulfil Princess Diana\u0026rsquos dream. They\u0026rsquore a double act.Burrell said he could see that Harry, who had never got over his mother\u0026rsquos death when he was 12, had found true love and someone with whom he could identify because of their similar interests in humanitarian work.\u0026nbspMeghan was the perfect choice to help him carry on his mother\u0026rsquos legacy.\u0026ldquoShe is 36, the same age as his mother was when she died. She\u0026rsquos a professional woman, a humanitarian. I think the first conversation they had was about what she wanted to do to help other people. That rang a bell with him. It reminded him of his mother.Her previous career will also come in handy. \u0026ldquoShe\u0026rsquos joined the biggest soap opera in the world. She\u0026rsquos done her apprenticeship in Suits and now she\u0026rsquos just been cast in the biggest role she has ever had, he said.Even the Queen has been known to describe her job as acting when she is in private.\u0026nbspPrincess Diana, like Meghan Markle, was a dogged activist\u0026ldquoThe Queen has often said to me, what costume should I wear today? Burrell said. \u0026ldquoBut when she is back behind closed doors she is back as a wife, mother and grandmother. He suggested Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos shared interests and their desire to help improve people\u0026rsquos lives around the world would cement the May 19 marriage at George\u0026rsquos Chapel, Windsor, and make it last. The younger royals\u0026rsquo cocoon at Kensington Palace, away from prying eyes inside Buckingham Palace, will also mean they face less of the stifling interference that Greer cited as a reason for a quick orce. But Burrell warned that Meghan would still need to find a support network of friends or family to handle the pressure cooker atmosphere inside the Royal Family. The family side of that may be difficult, unlike for Kate, who has the support of the tight-knit Middleton family. Meghan is close to her mother, Doria Ragland, but she lives half a world away in Los Angeles and relations with much of the rest of the family are strained or nonexistent. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure her friends will be Prince Harry\u0026rsquos friends at first but that will change, he said. \u0026ldquoShe needs to grow her own nucleus of friends. She just needs to have people around her she can trust.\u0026nbspPaul Burrell was a close confidant of Princess DianaBurrell, whose own two boys were playmates for Harry and his brother Prince William when they were young, said he thought Harry and Meghan would end up with a large family, drawing on his memories of how they were when they were younger. \u0026ldquoAs children, he and William both said they would have large families. I predict Meghan will be pregnant before Christmas. I bet William will have four. Both William and Harry wanted to have more brothers and sisters when they were young but it wasn\u0026rsquot to be, he said. Burrell, who orced his wife Maria after 32 years of marriage and married his \u0026ldquosoul mate Graham Cooper last year after coming out as gay, hailed Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos intention to campaign for gay rights through the Commonwealth, where 36 of the 53 nations still criminalise homosexual acts. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a tough job. You can\u0026rsquot force laws to be changed and tell countries what to do but over time countries can change. Even the Royal Family can change, he said, recalling how both William and Harry were schooled in gay rights by their mother at an early age.\u0026nbspBurrell says the royal couple\u0027s engagement video shows how in love they are\u0026ldquoShe taught the boys about gay rights. I remember Elton John and David Furnish coming to Kensington Palace for lunch with Diana and the boys and they were wearing rings. William asked about same sex marriage and she explained that they loved each other. \u0026ldquoDiana was before her time. I remember when we were in Angola on the landmines campaign, Diana saying to me, \u0026lsquoAll our souls weigh the same. We are all equal\u0026rsquo. Her crusades and her emotional torment inside the Royal Family eventually created a more tolerant approach inside The Firm that makes Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos marriage more likely to survive, according to Burrell. \u0026ldquoWe are talking about a woman in 2018. We are not talking about a woman in 1981, he said.\u0026nbspAs Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to walk down the aisle, see her striking similarities to his mother Princess Diana.                    Getty Images1 of 15Princess Diana and Meghan Markle come from humble backgrounds. Diana first started out as a nanny and Meghan at 13 worked as a yogurt shop girl at Humphrey Yogart in LA\u0026ldquoDiana paved the way for the next generation of royal women. She created the path for Kate and Meghan. If Diana came around now she would have a better chance of surviving.\u0026nbspHe predicted that the couple would be freer than William and Kate to pursue their own campaigns and crusades and in time, when the Cambridges\u0026rsquo children are grown up, Harry and Meghan might not even need to be full-time working royals, he said. \u0026ldquoI can see them living in America for part of the year, fulfilling Diana\u0026rsquos dream, he said. \u0026ldquoShe always wanted to have a house in America. But whatever they do, wherever they go, Diana will always be with Harry and his brother, Burrell said. \u0026ldquoWhen Harry and William are standing in that chapel on May 19, their thoughts will turn to the one person who won\u0026rsquot be there \u0026ndash but she will be there in spirit.

It was all in a day\u0027s work for the detective except for one small detail: Ron Stallworth is black.His extraordinary penetration of the violent heart of America\u0027s hardcore racists is told in film director Spike Lee\u0027s new thriller BlacKkKlansman, just announced as an official American entry in the Cannes Film Festival and coming to British screens later this year.                Ku Klux Klan leader warns \u0027there will be more violence\u0027                 ANGER student who dressed as KKK member will participate in boat racePHRon Stallworth\u0026rsquos Ku Klux Klan membership cardIt was extremely dangerous to be a black man in the KKK, admits Stallworth, aged 65, in an exclusive interview with the .If I\u0027d been exposed it could have all gone horribly wrong. The Klansmen were armed and there was always a peril.Stallworth, who has received numerous death threats since revealing how he fooled the Klan, was an undercover detective in Colorado Springs, Colorado - the city\u0027s first black officer - when he infiltrated the group.It was 1979, a year when the Klan killed five protesters in North Carolina and hung nooses from trees as threats across the Deep South.Stallworth was working in criminal intelligence and organised crime when he spotted a newspaper ad seeking members for a new KKK chapter.I wrote to the PO Box posing as a white racist.He explained that he hated blacks, Jews, Hiics, Chinese, Japanese, Italians - anyone who wasn\u0027t pure Aryan.I used every racial slur I knew to sound like one of them, he says.I gave them an untraceable phone number in my office but I wasn\u0027t thinking straight and used my real name, which could have been disastrous if they were any smarter but the Klan weren\u0027t the brightest bulbs in the socket.ALAMYFULL OF HATE: KKK Grand Wizard David Duke in 1978A week later a Klan organiser phoned, asking why Stallworth wanted to join.I said my sister is dating a n***** and every time he puts his filthy hands on her white body it makes me mad. And I want to stop that happening again.BUT when Stallworth didn\u0027t hear back he went straight to the top.I phoned the KKK Grand Wizard David Duke in Louisiana and asked why my membership was being delayed. He said my application was on his desk and promised to deal with it personally.It was the first of many conversations with David Duke. We talked about his family, the weather and about his political ambitions.Once I asked him, \u0027How do you know that you\u0027re not speaking with a n***** who\u0027s pretending to be white just to fool you?\u0027 He said, \u0027N****** don\u0027t talk like white folk. We say How are you but a n***** says, How are-a you. It gives them away.\u0027I couldn\u0027t help laughing. Sometimes my sergeant would listen to me spouting racial slurs, saying how much I hated n****** and he would laugh so hard he had to leave the room.But it was no laughing matter when the KKK wanted to meet their new recruit.They wanted to know what I looked like so I described one of my fellow undercover detectives, whom I\u0027ll call \u0027Chuck\u0027 to protect his identity.In Spike Lee\u0027s movie Chuck is played by Star Wars\u0027 nefarious Adam Driver.When it came to meetings I\u0027d send Chuck and briefed him on all the phone calls and plans we had made. Then after meeting the Klan posing as Stallworth he would tell me what happened.For more than seven months we infiltrated the local Klan, exposing their criminal plans.Corbis  GettyStallworth\u0027s investigation ended when he was asked to head the local Klan chapterThere were two gay bars in town that they wanted to bomb and the Klan had military members with explosives experience so the threat was real.Two Klansmen were working for NORAD monitoring US air space for missile attacks. I contacted the Pentagon and the next day they were reassigned to a posting near the North Pole.The Klan wanted to steal assault weapons from the nearby US army base at Fort Carson to use in attacks but I made sure that we talked about it so long that nothing got done.They planned three cross burnings but I was able to secretly call in so many uniform police cars to each location that it scared the Klan off. Most of their criminal plans were thwarted by their own incompetence.But he pushed his luck to the limit when David Duke visited Colorado Springs and Stallworth was assigned as the Grand Wizard\u0027s police bodyguard.On the outside I was cool but on the inside I was sweating bullets, he says.I was worried that Duke would recognise my voice but he never made the connection. When we met I told him, \u0027I don\u0027t agree with your political philosophy but I\u0027ve been assigned to keep you safe and I will do that.\u0027He shook my hand and I asked if I could be photographed with him. When I put my arm on Duke\u0027s shoulders he angrily brushed it off but just as the photograph was taken I put my arm back on his shoulder.Duke lurched for the camera but I grabbed it first. As he tried to snatch it away I told him, \u0027If you touch me that\u0027s assault on a police officer, with a five-year sentence.\u0027 He and about 20 Klansman stared me down but I lived to keep the photograph - sadly now lost.The undercover investigation ended when Stallworth was asked to accept leadership of the local Klan chapter.They said I had proven a loyal and capable Klansman, he laughs.But my police chief said we had to end the operation because we might be bordering on entrapment. That night the Klan burned a cross on a lawn in Colorado Springs and I wasn\u0027t there to stop it.Stallworth still has his red KKK membership card signed by Duke - It\u0027s in my wallet - and his framed certificate of membership.But he never received his white hood: The police department refused to approve the expense.When he penned his memoir Black Klansman, due to be published in the UK this year, the Klan turned on him.The FBI warned me that there were eight pages of online threats, people wanting to lynch me.Stallworth is now retired and living in El Paso, Texas, with his wife Patsy and served as a consultant on the movie.I hope it alerts people to the continuing danger of the Klan, he says. The KKK is still active across America and there is always the potential for them to strike at me if this film makes me a target.To pre-order Black Klansman by Ron Stallworth, published by Century Publishing at \u0026pound12.99 on June 5, call the Express Bookshop with your debitcredit card on 01872 562310 or order online at expressbookshop.co.uk UK delivery is free.
