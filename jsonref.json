They don\u0027t know if he understands what he is saying but his determination to imitate words correctly shows how important social contact is for elephants.         Kosik, an elephant living in a Korean amusement park, has taught himself to say \u0027yes\u0027, \u0027no,\u0027 \u0027lie down\u0027 and \u0027sit\u0027 with a sort of whistling sound (stock image)Life in the wild is supported by myriad different sounds among the herd. Many are at frequencies too low for the human ear to hear but, by using specialised recording equipment, it\u0027s been possible for researchers to discern hundreds of different calls, with meanings ranging from \u0027I love you\u0027 to \u0027Get lost\u0027.Elephants are one of the five species of mammals — the others are humans, bats, seals and whales — assumed to be capable of learning how to produce new sounds. Batyr, an elephant who lived all his life in a Kazakhstan zoo without having seen another of his species, even learned to swear.Some creatures can learn to speak the language of other animals, or attempt to.For example, orcas are known to imitate dolphin sounds and to use this skill to communicate with dolphins.Food looms predictably large in many animal dictionaries.Horses, for example, can turn their ears by almost 180 degrees and use the angle to tell one another where the best grazing can be found. And both they and cows are thought to use eye contact to convey similar messages.For chimps, nibbling on a leaf is an invitation to flirt, while male pandas have to bleat like sheep to attract the ladies.In mating mice, more creativity is required. Operating at high frequencies, inaudible to humans, courting males compose and sing love ballads. They have fixed elements and patterns but, since females prefer songs to be as complex as possible, each suitor adds his own flourishes.Remarkably, song variations between different species of mice are far greater than those between different birds.But for aquatic creatures like the Caribbean reef squid, it\u0027s all about semaphore. During courtship, males split their bodies into differently hued halves, one side in colours attractive to females, the other in shades which warn off rival males. These are part of displays so complicated that it\u0027s believed that squid have their own form of grammar.So do some species of fish who seduce lovers (and discuss other matters) by vibrating their swim bladders — gas-filled bags on the stomach — to make \u0027pop\u0027 noises.Sound plays an important role in communication between dolphins. Technical advances have enabled researchers to translate their first dolphin word — a whistle meaning sargassum, a type of seaweed.It\u0027s also known that wild dolphins call one another by name. Bats too have inidual monikers to identify each other in the dark.In battles over territory, they fly furiously at each other and escalate the disputes with ever more complicated combinations of sounds — much like two humans trying to talk over each other.         Animal Languages by Eva Meijer is published by John Murray, £14.99Self-defence takes equally vocal form in other species, for example chickens. Their repertoire of around 20 alarm calls includes different sounds for predators in the air and those on land.Even insects use communication to convey threats. Take the Californian thrip, a winged insect whose larvae produce an alarm pheromone, the ratio of substances within it varying according to the level of perceived danger.Closer to home, crows have different sounds for \u0027cat\u0027 and \u0027dog\u0027 and even distinguish between an old cat who does not hunt and a young cat who might be targeting their offspring.For other wildlife, communication is an all-consuming business calling on all parts of their body. Jacky dragons (a species of lizard), for example, talk to each other in four ways: through posture, the number of feet they have on the ground, by head nodding and by puffing out their throats.This might appear simple and unsophisticated, but there are 6,864 possible combinations — 172 frequently used. The sequence and length of the actions are important to their meaning, which suggests a system of grammar.By comparison, our household pets seem relatively tongue-tied. Yet they communicate more than we realise, with dogs able to tell if another canine\u0027s growl is about protecting food, stopping an intruder, or expressing anger.You might also want to take more notice of your dog\u0027s wagging tail. Although it apparently swishes to and fro randomly, there is often a bias to the right, indicating the dog is happy, or to the left, signalling insecurity or fear. Such nuances are often lost on humans, so what hope is there that we will ever be able to talk \u0027with\u0027 rather than \u0027at\u0027 the animals?One development has been a website developed by the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, which protects elephants threatened by poaching and habitat loss in Africa. Called \u0027Hello in Elephant\u0027 it translates human words and phrases into elephant calls, with videos showing how they might say such phrases as \u0027Let\u0027s celebrate\u0027 or \u0027I\u0027m frisky\u0027.Sadly, research shows the elephant word for \u0027human\u0027 equates to that for \u0027danger\u0027 and therein lies perhaps the biggest question of all. Perhaps science will one day make it possible for us to \u0027grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals\u0027, to borrow from the lines sung by Rex Harrison in 1967 film Doctor Dolittle.But while it suits us to continue exploiting them for food and profit, will we ever be prepared to follow Dr Dolittle\u0027s example and listen to what they say? Animal Languages by Eva Meijer is published by John Murray, £14.99. © Eva Meijer.

Witnessing this mega city from the plane is to suddenly realise the immensity of modern China. Roughly 50 million people live in this urban sprawl surrounding Hong Kong.Lianzhou is a four-hour drive from Guangzhou into the forested mountains of Guangdong province. It is perhaps an unlikely destination for a major arts event. But in 2005, Duan Yuting, a 47-year-old former photo editor for a Guangzhou newspaper, chose the city to found the festival, now firmly established as China’s leading contemporary photography event.For its 15th edition, the work of 50 artists from China and around the world can be viewed in a museum and two former industrial spaces in Lianzhou.One of the first exhibitions on show at the Granary venue is Argentinian artist Seba Kurtis’s series Immigration Files. Kurtis grew up in Buenos Aires before, at 27, escaping the Argentinian financial crisis of 2001 for a new life in Europe, only to find more hardship as an illegal immigrant in Tenerife.One of the few things Kurtis brought to Europe was a shoebox of family photographs and Super 8 films, rescued from his grandmother’s home after a flood. Mixed in with the photographs were artworks that Kurtis’ younger sister had created with glitter and glue. The flood had damaged the images, causing the glitter to meld with the emulsion from the photographs. Kurtis set about digitising these precious, distorted images. “I realised I couldn’t see the faces of family members I might never see again,” he says. “The water damage became representative of violence in my later work.”Kurtis, who is now based in Manchester, UK, would spend seven years as an undocumented immigrant on the Canary Islands and mainland Spain. The uncertainty and anxiety of that time, and his memories of the life he left behind in Argentina pervade the images on show at Lianzhou. In them, he returns to the bucolic coastlines of Tenerife and the Canary Islands – the first sight of land countless refugees glimpse as they cling to hazardous rafts crossing the Mediterranean.Evoking his sister’s artworks, Kurtis decorates these photographic landscapes with glitter. But he does so meaningfully as a way to visually illustrate recent sociological surveys detailing suicides, evictions and crimes among refugee communities in the Canary Islands. Aesthetically, he is linking his own history to that of the migrant experience. “The glitter represents my story, my family’s story,” he says.The tolls of migration, the loss of family and the pull of home are felt by many millions of Chinese citizens. These are captured with vivid detail by Chinese artist Qian Haifeng in his portraiture series The Green Train, an exhibition eight years in the making, and also on show at the Granary.“Green trains” are China’s cheapest form of long-distance travel. For the price of one first-class ticket from Shanghai to neighbouring Nanjing, one can travel the entire length of China on a green train. They are typically used by the lowest-income migrants. On the national day of the People’s Republic of China in October, these relics of the Cultural Revolution become the vessels for millions of Chinese migrants to return to their ancestral homelands.In the decade before he became a known photographer, Qian Haifeng was a fellow passenger. He was fascinated by the people with whom he shared such journeys – and never met again. In Lianzhou, he describes the carriages of the green trains as “live stages, where everyone’s lives are on display for others to see, and where everyone present has the potential to play a leading role”.Duan Yuting, the festival’s director, awarded Qian with the Lianzhou Foto festival’s Punctum prize in 2015. “When I gave him the award, many professional Chinese photographers did not like it,” Duan says. “But his most important characteristic is that he’s not an artist. He is just the same as the people on the trains. He lived there with them, and that’s how he related to them. That’s why only he was able to take these photographs.”The forested wilderness surrounding Lianzhou is home to some of the world’s rarest and most elusive animals, including China’s dwindling population of tigers.With this in mind, Swiss photographer Alex Hanimann displays his series Trapped at the Granary. This a collection of photographic portraits of wild animals taken by camera traps at night.Hanimann originally intended the images to be used in a scientific survey. But he realised his camera was capturing these secretive animals at their most expressive and characterful.Hanimann considers these images to be self-portraits – and unconscious selfies. The animals were unaware of the cameras, yet Hanimann saw “a world of small, dramatic happenings, micro-dramas and gestures”.Chinese authorities were present at the festival’s opening and did not take kindly to the work of Jenny Rova. Much of Rova’s exhibition, Älskling, which translates as “sweetheart”, was removed by censors before the public had chance to see it. In doing so, the authorities robbed Lianzhou of the chance to witness a beautiful and intimate example of conceptual portraiture.In 2015, the Swedish photographer, who lives and works in Zürich and combines her artistic practice with her work as a waitress, contacted each of her former partners. She asked them to send her all the images they took of her during their relationship. She ended up with 55 photographs from nine former lovers, revealed to us as Anders, Amir, Jonas, Henning, Étianne, Boran, Johan, Bruno and Dan.Speaking at the festival, Rova describes Älskling as: “My attempt to capture the way we look at each other when we’re in love, from one lover to the next.”Älskling begins in the hills surrounding Uppsala, Sweden, where Rova spent her teenage years, and ends with her facing orce while bringing up her infant son.By making these shared moments public, Rova reveals how different relationships can reveal contrasting, hidden sides of our personalities. The images comment on the role former relationships can play in the present of our lives – “you can sense the identity behind the camera,” she says.Behind the ScarA photographer dealing with memory, sex and the self in a radically ergent way is the Chinese photojournalist Liang Yingfei, who works for Beijing’s Caixin Media. Perhaps more so than any other artform, documentary photography is highly controlled in China, so Liang and her fellow photojournalists must develop creative conceptual techniques to explore their subjects without alerting the authorities.In Lianzhou, Liang tells the stories of sexual abuse survivors. The series, she says, was instigated after a friend was abused by a charity worker on a voluntary trip.After obtaining the trust of survivors of abuse, Liang used her camera to “reconstruct and visualise the recurring traumatic nightmares victims have experienced in the aftermath”. Her images include a slug crawling along a woman’s skin as she sleeps and a doll being held underwater.Resplendent with purple hair, the Shanghai-based photographer Coca Dai has been in trouble with the authorities before. But they allowed the festival to exhibit his compulsive, chronological portraits of his partner, Judy, over the course of their eight years together. The exhibition moves from portraits taken on the day they met, when the couple were still teenagers, through to the birth of their first child and on to the present day. Judy often poses like a conventional model but Coca’s images of her show her asleep, eating, or bathing herself or their child.Much of China remains avowedly patriarchal so unvarnished experiences of Chinese femininity are often hidden from view. Lin Ye, the Chinese curator, says of Coca’s exhibition: “In history, women have always lived under ship of men. They have been disciplined and trained to accept male scrutiny and cater to male standards. This visual mechanism has allowed women to internalise men’s scrutiny on themselves.”Coca’s unflinchingly honest portrayal of Judy, created in the linage of artists such as Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans, is an inversion of this lineage. These images may be authored by a man but they are a powerful portrait of modern Chinese womanhood. And they point, defiantly, to a more tolerant and hopeful future.For his series Freezing Land, Shanghai-based photographer Chen Ronghui used Kuaishou, or “choir show”, a Chinese social video app comparable to TikTok, to explore the lives of young people living in Fularji. The area was a once prosperous district in the province of Heilongjiang, near the border with North Korea. “Kuaishou is despised by many people in China,” Chen says in Lianzhou. “This is a story of young people getting back the right to express themselves.”The temperature can often drop to -30C (-27.4F) in Fularji, but the economy has frozen, too. “We’re used to thinking of Chinese cities purely in the context of massive growth but Fularji is an exception,” Chen says. Fularji was once China’s most renowned steel town. In the 1960s, it became home to the headquarters of China First Heavy Industries, and more than 15 million immigrants came to the region during Mao’s era. Today, it’s facing a bigger economic recession than anywhere else in China.Chen used Kuaishou to explore the lives of millennials living in the once great town, making contact first with Lin Zi, a 14-year-old who uses a local cafe to stream live performances online. After dropping out of school, Lin has gained almost a million fans. “My parents abandoned me and I make money by doing drag shows on a live streaming app,” Lin told Chen.“The young people I met on Kuaishou all experience a sense of uncertainty,” Chen says. “They face a choice: to leave for challenges in bigger cities or stay behind and embrace their fate. This is a wider story about China the uncertainty about our future, no matter who we are.”• Lianzhou Foto festival 2019 takes place in Lianzhou, China, until 3 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f11bd8c53136940ef3c8f80f1c5b3e3348e821e/0_0_5197_3307/master/5197.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c90b4d96719e290925249b31a3ad358 660w","title":"bet365 denise coates pay which markets revenues made","story":"Denise Coates’ £323m payday shows how successful the betting firm is – but in which markets?Private companies can do things differently. Bet365 can, for example, step outside its traditional reporting schedule and file its accounts at Companies House a month later than usual. That proved helpful this year. It prevented the latest mega payday for the founder and chief executive, Denise Coates – £277m in salary plus £46m in idends – from becoming a flashpoint in a general election campaign in which billionaire-bashing was a theme.Mind you, Coates’ aversion to the spotlight might have been welcomed by Jeremy Corbyn. She is not a straightforward case. Bet365 is a UK-domiciled company and Coates, by collecting her winnings in plain-vanilla payroll fashion, pays an awful lot of personal tax. The company also makes hefty charitable donations and her father, Peter Coates, used to be a big donor to Labour. There are easier targets to whack.For the financial world, and rival gambling companies, the intriguing detail about Bet365 is not Coates’ annual jackpot. The fascination is about how the company has been so successful. Or, more precisely, where?The accounts state Bet365 holds licences in 14 countries from Australia to Sweden. But then you read this careful sentence: “A geographical analysis of turnover has not been given, as in the opinion of the directors, such disclosure would be severely prejudicial to the interests of the group.”Severely prejudicial? A UK stock exchange-listed gambling company would not get away with that. Investors demand a geographic breakdown because they worry profits from unregulated, or “grey”, markets could dry up if local legislators launch a crackdown.“You know that we take bets from grey markets,” said a Bet365 spokesman, but he would not comment on the specific question of whether the company accepts wagers from China, where iniduals risk prison sentences by placing online bets.Thus, the annual mystery regarding the makeup of Bet365’s revenues rolls on, with no expectation that it will be solved soon. The company is clearly brilliant at what it does and, unless there is an upset in one of those unidentified “grey” markets, expect Coates’ annual pot to keep rising. It is probably odds-on that the Bet365 chief executive will pass £365m next year.“Audit is not broken but it has lost its way,” said Sir Donald Brydon in the introduction to his government-commissioned review. He’s being generous. His formula for how to improve auditing is not a gentle prod back towards the path of virtue. It reads more like a radical rewiring. After Carillion, Patisserie Valerie and all the other familiar corporate failures, so it had to be.Brydon’s list of recommendations is long and one can highlight three of the best. First, auditing should be separated from accounting. Good idea: if company auditors are seen – and see themselves – as mere number-crunchers, they are less likely to challenge managements and exercise independent judgment. A statutory regulator for a separate auditing profession sounds like progress.Second, audit reports should be more ambitious. “In hiding behind the need only to confirm and verify, many auditors have failed to grasp the opportunity to make their reports more informative,” said Brydon. So stop thinking in terms of “true and fair” assessments and start making more subtle and graded statements about a company’s resilience. Yes, that sounds more useful. Investors might even start to read audit reports. They might also take up another Brydon idea that they should be able to propose matters for the audit to cover.Third, make the directors, when proposing a idend, vouch that the payment “in no way threatens the existence of the company in the ensuing, say, two years”. Absolutely right. Dividends have been treated as a virility symbol by managements more caution might be exercised if, in extreme cases, the threat of legal action were to exist. Remember that Carillion, which went bust in January 2018, declared a £54m idend in May 2017.Brydon’s full 138-page report is worth a read. It’s more important the government acts on it – and fast.When Muddy Waters launches one of its blistering short-selling reports, the script normally runs like this. On day one, the target’s share pride plunges as investors take fright. On day two, the company defends itself robustly and the shares bounce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e129a9d2633d2c6a932028373187bbf482a27491/0_34_4945_2968/master/4945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=260055794ad13b5f10935e2e0b517e61","title":"brexit labour election corbyn left","story":"Honest reflection is rarely born from trauma: but a grief-stricken left must conduct a frank postmortem into the calamity of 12 December. While the 2017 election definitively proved the popularity of the left’s ideas, 2019 offers a brutal lesson from a campaign lacking a coherent message in the midst of a culture war.Those pointing at Brexit as a key factor in Labour’s election defeat are mocked for deflecting from the real reason: Jeremy Corbyn’s unpopularity. But the collapse in the Labour’s leader’s ratings between the 2017 election and last week’s rout are inextricably linked. In January, YouGov asked why voters with previously favourable opinions of Corbyn had changed their mind. About three-quarters of the responses were linked to Brexit, which dominated all political discourse after 2017 and smothered discussion of Labour’s popular domestic policies. Labour was tortured about how to keep its 2017 coalition of remain and leave supporters together, and was paralysed as a result.The decisive failure – yes, with hindsight – was that the Labour leadership did not use the political capital of the 2017 election to make a principled case for a Norway-style soft Brexit, and definitively rule out any future referendum. If that message had been held with stubborn discipline, a perception of weakness and dithering would have never set in. Whether it was truly politically feasible – and whether Labour’s membership could have worn it – is another question. The failure to move swiftly created space for the fantasy that the 2016 result could simply be reversed – and leading remain campaigners relished the opportunity to bully the Labour leadership and insult leave voters as gullible bigots.The left needs to own its failure in this election, but those who spent two years claiming Labour shifting to remain was a cost-free exercise, blocked only by Corbyn’s stubborn Euroscepticism, might consider entering their own period of introspection. Brexit is now settled: Labour must decisively rule out the prospect of rejoining the EU in its current form ever again.Labour has faced a remorseless assault – from daily papers and Facebook ads alike – but that cannot mean ignoring its own drastic errors. The victory lap that followed the 2017 election was a mistake, breeding fatal complacency. The leadership was often afflicted by a destructive bunker mentality – which was an understandable response to circumstances, but not a winning one. A bureaucratic machine-like politics at odds with the youthful idealism of the wider movement was too dominant. Labour insiders would often bemoan a complete lack of communications strategy – and no serious attempt to turn around Corbyn’s woeful ratings.What was so dire about the response to the antisemitism crisis was the absence of emotional intelligence. Corbyn is no antisemite, neither are the vast majority of the membership, but the antisemitism of a minority was real and caused profound hurt to Jews. What was missing in the leadership’s response wasn’t about improving internal processes – which happened too slowly – but rather engaging with the collective trauma of a minority who have faced systematic persecution for 2,000 years, an attempt to exterminate them within living memory, and who feel that at any moment, wherever they live, things could suddenly turn and, like their ancestors, they would have to flee. It is painful to watch a racist Tory political and media machine condemn the Labour party for racism – but we must accept that Jewish hurt is real, that it wasn’t properly addressed, and that this failure registered with the public.The leadership failed to defend itself on foreign policy issues. Surely it should have been possible to condemn the murderous folly of the Iraq war, the atrocities of the Saudi onslaught on Yemen, or the injustice of Israel’s occupation of Palestine, without also ineptly questioning the truth of Russia’s involvement in the Salisbury poisoning. That single episode inflicted terrible damage on Corbyn – and for what?Then there is the election itself. The campaign lacked any coherent narrative. When, before the manifesto launch, I asked a senior Labour official if it contained a clear vision, they replied “ish”. It was reminiscent of Oprah Winfrey shouting at her lucky audience, “You get a car! You get a car!” Each day a new policy was randomly thrown into the ether. The Tories had relentless message discipline. Labour’s offer felt bewildering, and as a consequence, unbelievable.If we are going to be honest in self-criticism, we must not draw false conclusions either. Claims that Labour suddenly lost working-class communities don’t engage with the fact that the party had a lead over the Tories among the working-age population – and a greater lead among those aged under 45 than Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide. It is among pensioners that Labour has become a fringe party: here is where its focus must now lie – without abandoning the progressive social values that are articles of faith to its young supporters.The tragedy of today’s left is that a political opening emerged when its only viable figureheads are either survivors of past struggles, or charismatic young fighters who are not in a position to become leaders. As the party’s former policy chief Andrew Fisher points out, a generation of being consigned to the wilderness meant the left had few experienced bureaucrats and organisers, particularly to navigate a hostile environment: that, at least, has changed now.Labour’s defeat was a calamity for the party and those it exists to represent. Corbyn’s leadership was partly destroyed by Brexit, by the remorseless attacks of its internal and external opponents, and by its own severe mistakes. Any new left project must learn from all of this. But from public ownership to tax justice to investment, it was not its signature policies that condemned it – and those ideas must remain at the core of whatever comes next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e98461eff4a208ead5b109513dba66f4fc1b2f5/0_0_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6641082765fab49676b3f708ec681a96","title":"home office spouse visas hostile environment","story":"On 28 November 2017, I burst into tears in the middle of a coffee shop after I learned that my spouse visa had been rejected by the Home Office. My lawyer had warned me that this would be the most likely outcome but it still felt like a punch in the stomach. I was being rejected by the country where I had spent the past seven years, although I was happily married to one of its citizens.I first arrived in the UK in 2010, aged 16 and on a child student visa, hoping to start a new life. My old life in Chechnya had broken into pieces the day my mother, a human rights activist, was kidnapped outside our house and murdered. With the support of my mum’s friends and colleagues, I moved to the UK, as she had wanted me to. In the following years I finished school, graduated from the London School of Economics and married the love of my life.I was 22, he was 24, Brexit had just happened, my visa was running out, so tying the knot seemed like the most sensible (and romantic) option. But we learned soon enough that love and human rights concerns were not enough for the Home Office to grant a visa. How naive we were.Our lawyer suggested that we should apply for a spouse visa via the human rights route. My three-kilo stack of visa documents included letters of support from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Front Line Defenders, saying it would be unsafe for me to return to Chechnya. My situation was complicated by the fact that half of my Chechen family disowned me for marrying a foreigner. We also didn’t meet the financial requirements, as my husband was completing his MA at the time, but we tried to find our way around it.There had been a supreme court ruling that upheld the minimum income requirement but condemned the Home Office for endangering the welfare of children it stated that third-party support should be considered when evaluating an applicant’s financial circumstances.My father-in-law was happy to be a third-party sponsor. He drew up a legally binding contract, promising to pay the minimum monthly income requirement. He even had himself audited and his house valued to prove that he could afford to continue the payments.In an attempt to meet the required income, my husband got a part-time job as a salesman for a tech company while doing his studies I was serving tables at an Italian restaurant (I could only legally work for 20 hours a week). For one and a half years, my life was constrained by the fact that my only form of ID, my Russian passport, was at the Home Office – I couldn’t leave the country, register at a hotel or even buy a pair of scissors.Eventually the Home Office claimed I hadn’t provided sufficient proof that I spoke a good level of English, seemingly forgetting I had finished school and graduated from university. It followed up with a few terse sentences, noting I had failed the financial requirements and that it wouldn’t consider third-party support – without any explanation of that decision.The Home Office saw no reason why my husband and I couldn’t settle in Russia – despite human rights organisations arguing that our lives might be at risk. That the Home Office appears to think it’s OK to tell citizens they should live somewhere else if they want to be with the one they love is a scandal in its own right.We appealed, our lawyer explaining that when similar cases go to appeal they are likely be overturned. Yet at £4,000 plus legal fees and no guarantee of success, this filters out many applicants by default. My husband got a job meeting the minimum requirements straight after graduation – but it would take six months before it would count – so we played the system: every request for information, every submission, drawn out to the last possible moment, hoping that the six months would pass before a tribunal date arrived. We made it, and finally after two years of uncertainty and stress, I received my two-and-a-half-year spousal visa.Despite the inconvenience and constant stress, I always remind myself how lucky I was to be able to stay by my husband’s side and rely on the kindness and generosity of my in-laws. When I was searching through immigration forums I came across devastating stories of “Skype families”, children separated from their parents, husbands from their wives because of these rules. We were lucky we could afford a lawyer who knew how to navigate Home Office bureaucracy, which feels like it is designed to trip you up.Battling the Home Office made me think that it’s occupied not by iniduals with feelings and emotions but by a primitive AI without empathy or discretion. But hostile environment policies were designed by people. They are calculated to keep immigration at bay, no matter the cost to people’s lives. The Windrush scandal is a case in point.Immigrants do far more for the UK than the UK does for them. They contribute their skills and invest in the economy, pay taxes and generally make this country a more interesting to live in. It is up to all of us, no matter our citizenship status, to stand in solidarity with migrants and resist whatever the next five years of Tory government brings.• Lana Estemirova is a graduate in international relations from the London School of Economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96b88ea5be7c0e53f51143548e3a6d21b6003c4/0_60_3042_1825/master/3042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c65f64ed30ba101181fff3af7f5402b","title":"the guardian view on brexit transition a safety valve not a trap","story":"Boris Johnson’s determination to limit the time available for EU trade talks is a triumph of gesture over good governmentAt the start of the election campaign, Boris Johnson promised to “end the groundhoggery of Brexit”. By this he meant the sensation of being trapped in a loop, condemned to repeat the same story, desperate to escape a repetitive present and begin the future. The appeal of such an escape to millions of people was confirmed in last week’s general election result. There is no disputing the government’s mandate to “get Brexit done”, even if the terms on which it is done remain negotiable.With that negotiation in mind, the prime minister plans to amend his EU withdrawal bill with more robust Brexit intent. The intention is to explicitly prohibit any extension to transitional arrangements that are due to expire at the end of next year. This is meant to signal Mr Johnson’s determination that the UK’s break with Europe will be swift and total.Given that complex free trade agreements can take up to a decade to complete, the expectation that one can be negotiated in less than 12 months is silly. Without a longer transition, the UK will face a new cliff-edge this time next year, similar to the one it faced when there was a credible prospect of crashing out of the EU with no deal at all. This is real “groundhoggery”, sending the country back into a cycle of fraught negotiations against a ticking clock. It is a dynamic that favours the bigger and better-prepared side of the table in trade talks, which is not the one on which Mr Johnson will be sitting.It is never a good idea to use legislation as a form of political advertising. Statutes should serve practical governing purposes, while Mr Johnson’s symbolic anti-transition clause makes good government harder. There could be compelling economic or diplomatic reasons for wanting more time to finalise trade talks. Having just won a healthy majority, Mr Johnson can afford to give himself options.The preference for limiting those options betrays a misconception of Brexit. Many Tories brush aside the legal significance of the formal 31 January exit date. They imply that transition blurs the distinction between membership and non-membership that Brexit itself will not be a reality until more severe rupture is achieved.This is a dangerous mistake. The article 50 phase of talks gave the UK privileges in talks with Brussels that it will not have as a “third country”. Once formal membership has expired, British leverage shrinks. Barriers for ratifying agreement are raised. Mr Johnson is in a hurry to be seen slamming the EU door behind him, unaware of how cold it will feel outside. Transition is not a trap to prevent the UK pursuing an independent trade policy it is a mechanism to allow both sides time to develop a mutually beneficial arrangement. Cutting it prematurely short increases the likelihood of souring that relationship. It raises the probability of Britain rushing into a bad deal to avoid the disruption that would accompany failure to reach a deal at all – a repetition of the dynamic that brought Mr Johnson to complete his substandard withdrawal agreement in October.The prime minister is obliged by politics and pride to pretend that the deal he struck is a great one. He imagines he can achieve another such triumph in the next phase of Brexit in the same way. Having learned nothing from the article 50 process, he intends to lead the UK into more brinkmanship with Brussels, ignoring the relative strengths of the two sides, and pretending that bombast can compensate for a lack of technical preparation. It cannot. If Mr Johnson does not change his strategy he will wake up in his very own Brexit Groundhog Day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf85e9477d9fca1044365cf5e4b9ff082aeebbc6/0_0_941_568/master/941.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df692fd19439c0272606239372acda35","title":"jimmy kimmel letter nancy pelosi","story":"Late-night hosts marked the eve before a likely House vote on impeachment by unpacking Trump’s angry six-page missiveOn the eve of the House’s likely vote to pass articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, Jimmy Kimmel looked at the case of two documents. The first, released Monday, was a 658-page report by the House Judiciary Committee detailing the president’s misdeeds. “Who’s gonna read that?” Kimmel asked. “You expect the American public to read a 658-page anything? We can’t even catch up on our TV shows.”The second was a six-page letter Trump wrote to House speaker Nancy Pelosi, in which the president “takes zero responsibility for his impeachment”, Kimmel summarized. “Of course, he says the same thing about Eric and Donald Jr.”The six pages decrying the impeachment process “might be the most deranged letter to Santa ever”, Kimmel continued. “It is a long, stupid, disingenuous and incoherent defense signed by an angry gorilla with a Sharpie.”The House will almost definitely pass the articles of impeachment this week, sending them to the Republican-controlled Senate for a trial, which Kimmel said will be a “joke”, since Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell already rejected Democrats’ request for witnesses this week. “He wants a no-witness trial. He also said he’ll be running the trial in close coordination with the White House – that seems fair,” Kimmel panned. “Let the guy on trial run it. Perfect.”On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert celebrated “impeachment eve” with a close reading of Trump’s letter to Pelosi. Prior to Tuesday, Trump had been relatively quiet about impeachment, Colbert said, “but the pressure clearly was building under the surface because this afternoon, the lid blew off Mt St Yellin’. The eruption came in the form of a six-page shriek addressed to Nancy Pelosi”.The letter was full of anger toward Pelosi, including some choice quotes such as: “Your spiteful actions display unfettered contempt for America’s founding and your egregious conduct threatens to destroy that which our Founders pledged their very lives to build.”“Yes,” Colbert responded, “a nation built on the belief that powerful white men face no consequences whatsoever.”Colbert called the letter “a disorienting mishmash of dry legal language mixed in with Trump’s signature angry word smoothies. For example: ‘the articles of impeachment introduced by the House Judiciary Committee are not recognizable under any standard constitutional theory, interpretation, or jurisprudence … You have cheapened the importance of the very ugly word, impeachment!’”“Happy now, Nancy?” Colbert asked. “You’ve cheapened something very ugly. That goes against everything Trump stands for – making very ugly things extremely expensive.”Trump also blamed the impeachment process on Democrats’ bitterness from the election loss in 2016 and accused Pelosi of viewing “democracy as your enemy!” Colbert, imitating the president, clarified: “Whereas I view democracy as a friend with benefits, because under me democracy is so screwed.”Trump also wrote that “more due process was afforded to those accused in the Salem Witch Trials”.“You know what? I agree with the president on this one,” Colbert said. “Fair is fair – we should throw him in the river.”Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he took “zero” responsibility for impeachment, which means, according to Colbert, “he takes foreign assistance, he takes daddy’s handouts, he takes a handful of any women who wanders into the grope zone, but he draws the line at responsibility”.Seth Meyers also addressed Trump’s letter on Late Night, in which the president said the impeachment inquiry was full of “shameless lies and deception” – “which is true, it’s called evidence,” Meyers retorted.“This letter is bonkers,” he continued. “I don’t even know how to describe the tone of it. I guess if you took the most privileged white lady ever and gave her a whole bottle of wine, and then asked her to write Yelp review of a restaurant that made her wait 40 minutes for a table and then got her order wrong twice.”Meanwhile, Trump’s re-election campaign is reportedly set to spend $400,000 on anti-impeachment ads this week, “which seems unnecessary when the best anti-impeachment ad has an office down the hall,” Meyers said next to a photo of Mike Pence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c216fa1dc757905bd6a3d2e51106dcc8b81e9b7c/0_326_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19edbe1c140abd863e8f1a73147f4dbd","title":"how to revise without ruining christmas by exam experts","story":"The spectre of January exams can quash the holiday spirit, but these tips will help students prepare while leaving time to unwindThere’s nothing quite so effective at quashing the Christmas holiday spirit as the spectre of January exams. But if you get organised, plan your exam prep and follow our tips from revision experts, you’ll be ready to ace your tests while still making time for some all-important relaxing. Here are the best revision methods.One of the most effective ideas is to rewrite your notes and say things out loud, according to Carina Cunha of tutoring firm Crimson Education. “Rewriting your notes can help trigger your memory,” she says. “It can also help you organise the material better, making your notes easier to understand and absorb. It’s beneficial to then read them aloud – you are more likely to remember something this way than you would by reading the material in your head.”Sian Duffin, student support manager at Arden University, helps students deal with revision and exam stress. “Look at how effectively you are using your time,” she advises. “Figure out when you are most productive and plan your study around that – is it in the morning or at night? Is it for longer periods of time or short bursts with more breaks?”Make yourself a realistic revision timetable. There’s no point setting up a packed 7am-to-midnight learning schedule with a five-minute break for two meals: you’ll soon feel overwhelmed and give up. In my first year of uni, I used my old school timetable as a model for my revision time: it meant learning for 40-minute chunks, with regular breaks and an hour off for lunch, as well as time off in the afternoon to properly relax and get outside for some fresh air. Alternatively, there are lots of sample timetables to download online. Don’t forget to build in mini-rewards for each time you hit a target like learning a chapter of a textbook – I found chocolate to be a pretty useful learning incentive.“Diagrams work well when studying for anatomy or biology exams, and you are trying to memorise a process or a set of relationships,” says Cunha. The nature of revision means you’ll need to work solo some of the time, but partnering with a friend who works in a similar way to you can help you to reinforce learning and test each other. Sites like Quizlet can be useful: you can make your own flashcards, mini-tests and even games to help you to learn facts. You can also access some 300m study sets created by other students on topics stretching from film and graphic design to science, economics, and languages.Stick revision notes on your bathroom mirror, by the kettle, or near the loo. Not only does it give you lots of reminders, it can also help you in exams – you’ll think “Ah! The secretions of the liver ... that was on the mirror …’Previous years’ exam papers are a brilliant resource, but Valentine warns students to avoid trying to anticipate which topics will come up. She explains: “It may well be possible to figure out patterns from past questions if you look long enough, but it’s definitely not the most effective way to spend revision time. Relying too heavily on clues can end up with students getting caught out in the exam hall.”Try an app like Offtime or another digital detoxers – it blocks texts and notifications, restricts access to apps and will even limit your phone usage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71aa34afe1e6787da523acafdd15e79338189dbd/0_1721_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8009713af1db256abebc812f6c719f5","title":"no need to shop for teachers christmas gift unless it is wine survey says","story":"A homemade card will do for most – but primary teachers wouldn’t say no to boozeParents in a last-minute panic about Christmas gifts for their children’s teachers don’t need to worry: most teachers say the present they’d prefer is a homemade card – although primary school teachers would be just as happy with booze.With most schools in England closing for the Christmas holidays on Friday, an anonymous survey of more than 5,000 UK teachers conducted by the Teacher Tapp app revealed teachers would rather receive homemade cards from their pupils than the traditional offerings of wine or chocolate or other gifts.The exception, though, are teachers in primary schools, who were as likely to say they’d prefer wine as a painstakingly-drawn felt-tip and glitter Santa from Year 1.The popularity of a student’s own work over the sinful attractions of free alcohol and confectionary shows that teachers really are soft-hearted, even at secondary school, according to Becky Allen, Teacher Tapp’s co-founder and chief analyst.“Primary school teachers probably get blasé about getting homemade cards, whereas by secondary school it doesn’t happen as much, so it’s a real bonus to have the kids saying something meaningful about you,” said Allen.For those intent on giving chocolates – favoured by just one in six teachers - Terry’s Chocolate Orange topped the national popularity stakes, while Roses and Quality Street were the least popular.The relative popularity of Christmas gifts is one of the more unusual results uncovered by Teacher Tapp, an app dedicated to finding out what teachers think and how they do their job on a daily basis.The results have been eye-opening, according to Allen, an honorary research fellow at Oxford University’s department of education, in revealing the long and often unproductive hours teachers work, and how lonely the job can often be.“We’ve found that teachers spread their working day over really long hours. Many of them take a break after leaving school, either because they have got caring duties or they are exhausted, frankly,” Allen said.“They go home and then they start working again in the evening. We found that four in 10 teachers in any weekday evening are sitting in front of the TV doing their marking.“Psychologically, it can feel quite a burden to do a job where you feel like you are working from first thing in the morning, until the last thing you do before you go to bed is work.“You’ve got this infinite job, you don’t work as part of a team so you have to make your own decisions how to manage your workload, and that’s really hard for anyone to do.”Ironically, teachers themselves agree that marking books is often a waste of time – the educational researcher Prof Dylan Wiliam’s calls marking “one of the most expensive PR exercises in history”.“If you ever say to a headteacher, you could just drop the marking policy, they would be absolutely horrified. But there’s no rule that says you have to have one. But things get culturally embedded and then it’s hard to turn back,” Allen said.Allen and Laura McInerney, another former teacher and  education columnist, came up with the idea of Teacher Tapp in 2017, attracting seed funding to create the app that now has a dedicated user base of 6,000 teachers around the country answering the three or four brief questions sent each afternoon.In doing so Teacher Tapp has created a community of teachers who share the same profession but often have little contact with those outside their immediate area, even within their own schools.One of the saddest results uncovered by Teacher Tapp has been the substantial number of teachers who preferred to eat their lunch – often as short as 30 or 45 minutes a day – in their classrooms or offices, away from their colleagues.Allen says such responses have led her to think about the loneliness of teaching, “how isolating it is, how little teachers actually know about each other and the job they do.“Teachers don’t all hang out in the staffroom together as much as they used to, and fewer collegial conversations are taking place. It does mean that quite a lot of the dysfunction in schools comes from relative isolation and lack of understanding.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50ccb8cd5f3cd24eff7ed4e8c627ab3ea55d9d53/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e5fadae3be28196af595e9e4fc568eea","title":"scrooge is not an option how to dress to add some much needed christmas cheer","story":"’Tis the season to be jolly. I know, I know. Santa has some seriously heavy lifting to do, because never has the most magical time of the year been more desperately needed. Christmas is a care package of cinnamon baked goods and Baileys, timed to land at the moment when the world outside is at its darkest and coldest and most unwelcoming. And if ever a midwinter could do with a mood lift, it’s this one.The second Thursday in December is usually when the party season gets going, but this time around, the hangover kicked in before the fun. Mood plummeting, nausea rising: the election result was about as Christmassy as the scene in Gremlins when Phoebe Cates’s Kate explains how she found out Santa didn’t exist. (If you don’t know this scene, promise me you won’t look it up.)Being sentimental and schmaltzy by nature, I absolutely love Christmas, with its month-long licence to indulge those traits. But even if that’s not you, festive cheer is a three-line whip this year. Scrooge is not an option, frankly. We all owe it to our fellow humans to be as Christmassy as possible. That means wishing merry Christmas to every single bus driver and not taking the hideous cracker hat off the moment you think no one is looking. For Christmas magic to work, you need to believe in it.Being Christmassy in 2019 can feel complicated. The families who aren’t fractured and frazzled by arguments are worn down by collective hand-wringing. Brexit has politicised nostalgic ideas of Britishness, making the lamplit-snowy-cobblestones, rosy-cheeked Victoriana we associate with Christmas feel loaded. And while that referendum has a lot to answer for – not to mention the general election – they are not the only issues. The call for sustainability has taken the feelgood factor away from turbocharged shopping sprees. Even traditional Christmas cooking feels a bit out of sync with the zeitgeist: a turkey you can barely fit in the oven, plus sausages wrapped in bacon, isn’t going to work when half the family have gone veggie or vegan.So, as John Lennon sang about Christmas in 1971, let’s hope it’s a good one. We’ve still got gingerbread houses and Mariah Carey. We’ve got ice-skating, panto and seeing Christmas trees being carried home in nets. Gavin and Stacey. Some Christmas traditions are getting bigger every year. Advent calendars were once only for kids and were, in any case, just a picture of a reindeer behind a paper door. They are now marketed at grownups and filled with gin or luxury eye cream. Front door wreaths, which used to be for posh hotels or people with too much time on their hands, are everywhere.And it wouldn’t be Christmas without getting dressed up. The phrase “party season” makes December sound like a choreographed procession of sparkly red carpet moments that, even in jollier years, didn’t quite chime with reality. The reality, of course, being an endless round of emoji-heavy WhatsApp debates about which pub is more likely to have a table for 9pm on a Friday. But Christmas itself is worth getting dressing up for, whether you are on the tiles or on the sofa.This year, a tuxedo-style jacket has replaced the little black dress as the centre of gravity for your December wardrobe. Fashion has been very covered-up for the past couple of years, and when you have been in a polo neck and midiskirt for months, spaghetti-strap sequins are a big step out of the comfort zone. A tuxedo jacket turns your favourite black trousers and a silk camisole or blouse into instant black tie. (See Victoria Beckham’s Instagram feed for a masterclass on this look.)Lucinda Chambers and Serena Hood, ex-Vogue editors and the founders of the new tastemaking edit Collagerie, have an eye for a high street treasure – they have trawled Arket and Maisons du Monde for the best affordable pieces – but are not recommending a supermarket sweep for a whole new set of Christmas decorations, however temptingly inexpensive. “Buy one decoration a year – that way, your collection is really meaningful,” says Chambers.With this month’s Vogue cover starring Taylor Swift in an archive Chanel jacket – a landmark disruptive moment in the history of the fashion magazine as a shop window – glamour that doesn’t come with a side-order of landfill-guilt is a crucial element in the feelgood factor, which is what Christmas is all about.This week may not feel full to the brim with festive cheer. But chin up, buttercup. Like Roald Dahl said, those who don’t believe in magic never find it. This year your Christmas needs you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3733e88750456035ed8dedff21b3e5fa6b5af67a/0_89_2672_1603/master/2672.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9e1192324bae50e2932c8f71ab5bc8","title":"adam driver walk out interview npr fresh air voice","story":"Actor reportedly walked out of NPR’s Fresh Air rather than sit through a clip of himself singing a song from movieAdam Driver really does not like to listen to the sound of his own voice. In the middle of an interview on the NPR program Fresh Air earlier this month, the actor reportedly walked out rather than sitting through a clip of himself singing a song from the recent movie Marriage Story.Driver, who also appears in the new Star Wars film, left the New York studio abruptly during a remote interview with the show’s longtime host Terry Gross, Fresh Air’s executive producer Danny Miller confirmed to the Daily Beast. The producers of the show were aware that Driver preferred not to listen to or watch his own work – he told Gross as much in a previous interview – and said they encouraged him to remove his headphones, an offer that apparently irked him.“I don’t want to hear the bad acting that probably was happening during that clip,” Driver told Gross in the previous interview from 2015.“I’ve watched myself or listened to myself before, then always hate it,” he said. “And then wish I could change it, but you can’t. And I think I have, like, a tendency to try to make things better or drive myself and the other people around me crazy with the things I wanted to change or I wish I could change.”A New Yorker piece from October touched on what they called Driver’s “phobia” as well. In the story Driver recalled watching himself on Girls for the first time and recoiling.“That’s when I was, like, I can’t watch myself in things. I certainly can’t watch this if we’re going to continue doing it,” he said. Driver recalled hating seeing a scene of his in the film Inside Llewyn Davis and said he stopped watching altogether until the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”“I just went totally cold,” he said, “because I knew the scene was coming up where I had to kill Han Solo, and people were, like, hyperventilating when the title came up, and I felt like I had to puke.”Many actors have expressed a similar displeasure with or refusal to watch their own work, including Johnny Depp, Julianne Moore, Angelina Jolie and others, so Driver’s reaction is not out of the ordinary.Many other people outside of acting often register surprise or disappointment when they hear their own voices played back to them as well. The reasons for this are complicated ranging from a difference in the acoustic quality of the sound when it’s not being conducted through our own bodies, or various extra-linguistic cues, such as anxiety level, that only become apparent to the speaker when their voices are played back.“We don’t really understand why he left,” Fresh Air’s Miller told the Daily Beast. “We were looking forward to the interview. Terry thinks he’s a terrific actor, he was a great guest when he was on in 2015, so we were disappointed that we didn’t have a new interview to share with our listeners about Marriage Story.”Earlier this year Driver said he had a technique for avoiding watching his own films at movie premieres. Speaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Driver said: ‘‘I just go into a room and wait with a guy in silence, and then I got to go back and sneak in and pretend like I was there the whole time. It always seems like a better alternative than watching all the mistakes that you’re making that are now immortalised on film.’’Driver is not alone in avoiding watching his own films. Julianne Moore once has said that “I haven’t seen any of my movies”. Reese Witherspoon says watching her own movies would make her “spiral into a state of self-hate”. “I don’t know who feels good looking at themselves. Nobody, right?” Witherspoon said on Chelsea Lately. “It’s torture. Why would you want to watch yourself being stupid and pretending to be somebody else?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0082d92f6f27bae5c41bda02a2889d43f7f9af7a/704_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d7477236e6799df0f743c4621b93f4f","title":"cats review tom hooper judi dench idris elba taylor swift","story":"The queasy fears prompted by one of the most disturbing movie trailers ever seen are realised in full in Tom Hooper’s jaw-dropping feline follyThe filming of Cats is a difficult matter,It isn’t just one of your holiday games,Each actor involved here looks mad as a hatter,When the trailer came out, we were CALLING THEM NAMES.It began with Cat poems from old TS Eliot,In the 80s, Lloyd Webber just put them on stageThat was frankly a bit of a gamble for Andrew, butCoach-loads of punters made Cats all the rage.Now Cats is on film, with many a lonely pussPlayed by performers of A-lister class.But the number of mammaries looks frankly erroneousAnd tails that appear to emerge from each arse.There are lots of big names here, names we see daily,Names that supposedly give us a lift.Nothing like Jonathan Pie or Bill Bailey,But names like James Corden, and – yes – Taylor Swift.The setting is London, it does look post-nuclearThere aren’t any people, so maybe there wereBomb blasts – or maybe a bio disasterCausing cat-human mutants with digital fur.The twitching of ears on their heads is distractingAs they gaze at the greenscreen and sashay and crawl,It’s weird to behold them all gurning and acting,And why do so many resemble Darth Maul?Did director Tom Hooper intend this appearance?Did it make him feel happy – or cause him some stress?We have to assume that he gave it his clearanceBut THE MAN HIMSELF KNOWS and will never confess.These are the Jellicle felines of legend,All elbows and shoulders and undulant arms.Each male in the cast looks a bit of a bellend,And those bizarre whiskers don’t add to their charms.The Jellicles welcome Victoria: a new cat,Francesca Hayward’s the thesp with this role,She’s sleek, unlike Corden – well known for TV chatBut it’s his size that reveals that he’s meant to be droll.And then Idris Elba comes on as McCavity,(A boomy-voiced villain in anyone’s book)There’s a prominent gap in his penis locality.I honestly didn’t … well … know where to look.As Grizabella, Jennifer Hudson will sniffleSinging Memory, this movie’s moment of truth.But it’s warbling warbling warbling piffleFrom a bag lady drama-queen obsessed with lost youth.The Jellicles’ leader is Old DeuteronomyJudi Dench has this part, looking very bemused.What’s with that extra big fur coat?

You will never have a better chance for drinking it,” she promises.American chef Thomas Keller nails it for me, however, when he calls gougères “basic and delicious” – because, despite the fancy name, they are indeed pretty basic: a simple choux pastry that can be made weeks in advance, and baked to featherlight perfection straight from the freezer. Perfect Christmas fare, whenever you eat them.Choux pastry, the same one that’s used to make profiteroles, sounds more complicated than it is: in fact, it requires very little in the way of skill, though an understanding of the process is helpful. Water is heated with butter until the latter has melted, then flour is beaten in to create a paste. This beating not only brings the mixture together, but activates the gluten in the flour, making the dough stronger and stretchier (helpful for rising), while the heat dries it out and denatures the proteins, so they’re not so elastic that they immediately snap back into shape. Eggs are beaten in to emulsify the dough, the yolks adding softness, the whites strength, followed by cheese or other flavourings, before the choux is piped or spooned on to trays and put into a hot oven, where the remaining moisture evaporates and expands, causing the buns to rise and dry out, until eventually you’re left with a crisp shell of savoury dough. That’s the theory as I understand it, anyway.Nicole Kaplan’s gougères at New York’s Eleven Madison Park were described by Jonathan Reynolds in the New York Times as: “a gossamer of gruyere so light that it can be brought to your table by a butterfly and evaporates on your tongue seconds after making contact – leaving behind only the sound and memory of a thin crunch, the nutty aroma of milk’s leap toward immortality, and a child-like impatience for more.” Kaplan uses strong bread flour to achieve this, which, according to Segnit’s Lateral Cooking, will help make the dough stretch further. But we find, in amateur hands at least, that it also makes it slightly tougher, putting us in mind of cheesy dough balls, rather than featherlight gougères.Judy Joo uses a mixture of milk and water in Korean Food Made Simple which gives a better flavour, but a softer finish. Given the amount of cheese that goes in, I don’t think this dough needs much help on the flavour front, but a little crispness is very welcome, so I’m going to stick with the plain water variety. Bear in mind that you want the dough to be as dry as possible, so don’t be afraid of overcooking it once you put it back on the heat. It’s also wise to let it cool a little before adding the egg, to reduce the risk of the latter scrambling.Gruyere is the classic choice: in his book, Egg, Michael Ruhlman says there is a feeling that, “because they are a French preparation, one should use only a French cheese … I say it’s fine to add a little parmesan to the mix, and cheddar would surely work as well”. I try grana padano and mature cheddar, and can confirm that both work well, as indeed would just about any hard cheese (mimolette, red leicester or Scottish red cheddar would give good colour). But for that distinctive, sweet-salty flavour, gruyere or another mountain cheese would be my pick every time – and, as Hopkinson observes in Simon Hopkinson Cooks, “the better quality the cheese, the more delicious the gougères”.You don’t need anything more than salt, but a gougère is improved immeasurably by a good pinch of mustard powder, which Segnit calls the “unsurpassable flavour enhancer” when it comes to cheese. Joo also adds Korean chilli flakes, which is a good call if you’re looking for a touch of spice (Kaplan’s cayenne pepper does much the same job), while Hopkinson and Willan go big on the nutmeg, which I always think pairs particularly well with gruyere and its ilk.Finishing with a quick brush of egg and a sprinkle of cheese will give your gougères a glorious tan: if you run out of either, however, it’s not the end of the world.Though it’s not necessary to wield a piping bag – you’ll be pleased to know Hopkinson deploys two wetted spoons – it will yield more even results. Keller’s Bouchon Bakery book calls for the gougères to be frozen in silicone moulds, “to ensure they are uniform” if you have them, use them, but they’re certainly not necessary for anyone but the most serious control freaks. (Joo’s batter is so very wet that I have to put hers into them, so they do come in useful, after all, turning out delicious, almost quiche-like results – not classic gougères, perhaps, but that doesn’t stop us all scoffing them.)Kaplan gives three tips for success to the New York Times: refrigerate or freeze the dough after piping, because “it will rise better in the oven”, eat them immediately – “like topical plays, they lose value every couple of minutes” – and, most importantly, “if you’re serving them to friends, make millions”. Having baked a batch of the same dough immediately, after refrigeration and straight from the freezer, I don’t notice a great deal of difference, though the frozen ones are perhaps slightly puffier. So … up to you, but Kaplan’s right on the millions thing: people can really put these things away. (For this reason, I prefer them bite-sized, though you can make them larger, if you wish just adjust the cooking time accordingly.)As the moisture evaporates, the little buns will rise, creating a cavity in the middle if there’s too much liquid in there, however, they’ll collapse (which is only a disaster for your pride they’ll still taste fabulous). To facilitate this process, like Keller, I’d advise starting them off in a hot oven to drive off as much water as possible, and then turning the heat down so the outsides don’t overcook before the middle has dried out, taking a tip from David Lebovitz and cutting a hole in the shell to let the steam out in the final five minutes. That said, I rather like a bit of squish in the centre, so you might want to play around with the timings until you find your own sweet spot.To reheat ready-cooked ones (hey, you might have leftovers, you never know), put them into an 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 oven for five minutes.250ml water80g butter, cubed½-1 tsp fine salt5 large eggs150g plain flour, whisked¼ tsp freshly ground nutmeg (optional)2 tsp mustard powder (optional)175g gruyere or other hard cheese, gratedLine two baking sheets and, if you’re cooking immediately, heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7. Put the water, butter and salt in a medium pan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally to help melt the butter. Meanwhile, crack four of the eggs into a jug and beat together.Take the pan off the heat and pour in the flour, stirring until it comes together into a paste. Put back on a low heat, and stir until you have a smooth ball and the dough is starting to form a layer on the base of the pan – this should take two to three minutes.Take off the heat and use a stand mixer or hand beaters to beat the dough for about five minutes, until cooled.Beat in the four eggs little by little, making sure each addition is well incorporated before adding the next, then stir in the nutmeg, mustard powder and four-fifths of the cheese.Dab a little of the mixture on the bottom corners of the baking paper to stick it to the trays, then pipe or spoon walnut-sized blobs on to the paper, spacing them out well.If baking immediately, whisk together the last egg with a dash of water or milk, then brush on to the buns, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and put them in the oven. (If you’re not cooking them at once, chill the trays overnight or freeze for up to a month, and bake from frozen as below.) Turn down the heat straight away to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6 and bake for 20 minutes, then pierce the side of each one with a small knife and put back in the oven for five minutes to let the steam out, before removing and devouring while they’re still warm.• Cheese puffs or gougères: whatever you call them, are they the best party food ever, or would you make an argument for straws, pinwheels, or something else entirely?

City are believed to have demanded around £1m in compensation for their assistant coach but are still awaiting formal discussions with Arsenal to settle this.City, who beat Oxford United 3-1 last night to set up a Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Manchester United, do not want to stand in Arteta’s way but are not happy with the way Arsenal have gone about their business. A club source said: “It’s surprising to hear that plans are being made by Arsenal to unveil our coach as their head coach on Friday on the basis that no contact has been made by the club to discuss this matter.”Pep Guardiola refused to speak about Arteta’s future after the win at Oxford. “When there’s news I will answer it but there’s no news,” he said.Arteta has no experience as a manager, though he has worked alongside Guardiola since July 2016. The former midfielder was a candidate to take the Arsenal job 19 months ago before the club opted for Emery to take over from Arsène Wenger, who on Wednesday backed Arteta but said the 37-year-old Spaniard would need to choose a backroom team astutely.“I believe Arteta has certainly a great future,” Wenger said. “He has certainly learned a lot in his first position as an assistant coach and after that as well he will have to deal with the fact that he has no experience at that level and he will have to get surrounded well.”Brendan Rodgers was on Arsenal’s shortlist this month but signed a new contract at Leicester. Arteta is set to take over a team 10th in the Premier League after winning one of their past nine league games going back to early October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3aaafd41d5a929928e9cd57d3d30404883b21ff6/0_205_3076_1845/master/3076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b4755e5d5696ff404e4ffd44b19edb2","title":"manchester united colchester carabao cup quarter final match report","story":"If Marcus Rashford performs, Manchester United often follow suit. So it was that he transformed this quarter-final, turning it on in the second half to give Ole Gunnar Solskjær the win, which is the best way to celebrate his first anniversary of taking charge on Thursday.They were then drawn to play Manchester City, who they beat at the Etihad on 7 December, in the semi-final. Despite this Solskjær believes a new gameplan will be required. “You won’t beat City twice in a row or three times with the same tactics so we’ll have to do something better. Pep will have his team fired up,” he said.Rashford scored the opener and was a key factor in the other two strikes in a 10-minute burst that was precisely what was required against a Colchester who had been durable. It took the striker to a career-best 14 goals for the club in one season, though Solskjær held back from describing him as world class.Solskjær proved he meant business by including Harry Maguire, Anthony Martial and Rashford. “A fully loaded team,” the Colchester manager, John McGreal, said.Colchester, who had brought 5,271 fans, ensured everyone was behind the ball as they settled in for a long siege. United enjoyed virtually all the possession as would be expected against opponents standing ninth in League Two. Mason Greenwood had a shot blocked. Andreas Pereira pinged a 40-yard pass in behind to Greenwood who just failed to connect with the ball.Manchester City will need to beat rivals Manchester United over two legs if they are to defend the Carabao Cup trophy this season. City and United, who beat their neighbours in the Premier League on 7 December, were paired together in the semi-final draw.The other last-four clash is also a derby, with Leicester taking on midlands rivals Aston Villa. City have won the trophy in three of the last four seasons, with United not making the showpiece of this competition since 2017, when they left it late to beat Southampton. Leicester have reached the semis for the first time in 19 years, when they went on to beat Tranmere in the final, while Villa were last at this stage in 2013, losing to Bradford.\u0026nbspThe first legs will be played in the week beginning 6 January, with the return fixtures taking place three weeks later. On drawing rivals City in the last four, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told Sky Sports: We always want to win trophies and we want to win games. We\u0027ve got a nice little draw coming up so it\u0027ll be exciting times coming up. I don\u0027t think anything is written in the stars. We just work hard and you take what you get and you do the best out of it.The latter was indicative of United’s problem: the final pass was not being delivered precisely enough. When Pereira did slide an inch-perfect pass to Rashford the forward had a clear run at Dean Gerken but his control was slipshod and Colchester escaped. Next Rashford – again – failed with his first touch right in front of the goalkeeper and the ball bounced to safety.All of this caused merriment to the travelling contingent who cheered every United misstep in a contest of attack-v-defence compressed around the Colchester area.Solskjær’s team struggle against sides who do not come at them, so having to try to break down visitors whose playbook was similar could be counted a useful exercise. The problem, though, was that by half-time United had not done so which meant the chance of a surprise scoring breakaway for Colchester could not be ignored.The manager may have reminded his players of this at the break while also encouraging more composure. Greenwood came close to stabbing home from close range after Colchester were breached in behind. The sense was that one goal could lead to a few – and this would prove the case. Yet when Ryan Jackson broke down his right-back berth and shot, Sergio Romero had to save.Now, though, United struck. The keeper quickly found Nemanja Matic and he dinked a 30-yard ball into Rashford down the left. From here the 22-year-old turned on the after-burners, cut inside, left a panicking defence trailing and smashed past Gerken.United’s second followed soon after. This time Greenwood was the supplier as he aimed for Rashford at the far post only for the unfortunate Jackson to steer home from near in.Rashford’s last act, before he was replaced by Jesse Lingard, was to set up Martial to make it 3-0, with Brandon Williams coming on for Luke Shaw. The goal flurry meant United could coast through the remainder of the game and enjoy a night of satisfaction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1759b506dc53decc00ae910674928a172a51f92/0_133_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58d4a6da76fd8aef039ee61273d3e018","title":"monterrey liverpool fifa club world cup semi final match report","story":"• Monterrey 1-2 Liverpool• Firmino scores 91st-minute goal to set up final against FlamengoDifferent continent, different competition, same old Liverpool. The Club World Cup semi-final proved a complication for the European champions but Roberto Firmino found a familiar solution with a stoppage‑time winner against Monterrey.“Staying on track is part of our game,” said Jürgen Klopp. The track leads to a final with Flamengo on Saturday, and the chance to be crowned best in the world for the first time.The importance of the competition was writ large on the devastated faces of the Monterrey players after Firmino tapped home an intelligent cross from his fellow substitute Trent Alexander‑Arnold to seal a slender and difficult victory.Liverpool were disrupted by illness and injury and grateful for Alisson’s commanding presence on the big occasion once again. Klopp’s team were also left in no doubt they must raise their game considerably against the Copa Libertadores champions to make the journey to Qatar, with all its complications and ramifications back home, worthwhile.“It will be more difficult for sure,” Klopp said of the final. “I don’t know who exactly will be ready for the next game. I saw the Monterrey bench and it looked like it had 10 to 15 players on it. Flamengo’s season is over and they are here with a full squad. We just have to recover as quickly as possible.” Winning whatever the circumstances certainly helps.This was an awkward assignment for the Liverpool manager from the outset. His concerns over a pitch that had staged two other games in the previous 24 hours were unfounded - 18 ground-staff were on hand to tidy an immaculate surface following the warm-up and at half-time - but selecting a defence to play on it proved problematic. Virgil van Dijk was confined to his hotel room by illness and, with Dejan Lovren, Joël Matip and Fabinho already sidelined through injury, Joe Gomez was the only central defender available. It fell to Jordan Henderson to partner Gomez in the heart of an all-British back line in which James Milner also replaced the rested Alexander-Arnold. Teething troubles were inevitable, and Monterrey were alert to their opponents’ vulnerability in the air, but Liverpool’s control of possession – and Alisson’s assured performance – helped alleviate the pressure on their defence.The semi-final played out amid a strange atmosphere. One small pocket of Mexican supporters made an incessant noise while the rest of the stadium was subdued until the ball arrived in the vicinity of Mohamed Salah. The Egypt captain was determined to ensure his personal fanbase would be richly entertained.“The attention Mo gets in this part of the world is massive and I thought he dealt with that sensationally and played really well,” his manager said.Salah crafted the breakthrough when he took possession from Milner with his back to goal and his man marker for the night, Leonel Vangioni, in close attendance. He not only held off the Monterrey defender but had the awareness to spot Naby Keïta’s darting run behind Nicolás Sánchez and thread a superb reverse pass into the path of the midfielder. Keïta provided the touch that Salah’s work deserved and beat the goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero with an emphatic finish.Keïta’s runs from deep troubled Monterrey throughout but Liverpool had no time to settle on their early lead. The Mexican side were level within two minutes as the Premier League leaders struggled to deal with a free‑kick conceded by Milner’s foul on Rodolfo Pizarro. The set-piece was delivered to the corner of the Liverpool box where Stefan Medina towered above Keïta to head into the danger area. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain cleared only as far as Sánchez, whose overhead kick caught a teammate flush in the face but teed up Jesús Gallardo for a left-foot volley that Alisson pushed away. But straight to Rogelio Funes Mori, and the former Everton defender’s twin made no mistake from close range.Alisson prevented Funes Mori scoring again when getting a vital touch on a cross from Dorlan Pabón that was destined for the unmarked striker at the back post without his intervention. The Liverpool keeper also saved at full stretch from Pabón as Monterrey prospered in the space that Van Dijk would normally protect. His absence was felt.Monterrey (3-4-2-1)Barovero Montes (Layún 79), Sánchez, Vangioni (booked) Medina, Rodriguez, Ortiz, Gallardo (booked) Pabón (Meza 82), Pizarro (J González 90) Funes Mori Subs not used:\u0026nbspGutiérrez, Mejia, Urretaviscaya, Zaldívar, Basanta, A González, Cárdenas, Vásquez, Reséndez\u0026nbspLiverpool (4-3-3)Alisson Milner (Alexander-Arnold 75), Gomez (booked), Henderson, Robertson Oxlade‑Chamberlain, Lallana, Keïta Salah, Origi\u0026nbsp(Firmino 85), Shaqiri\u0026nbsp(Mané 68) Subs not used:\u0026nbspAdrián, Lonergan, Jones, WilliamsKlopp switched to 4-2-3-1 after the interval but Liverpool remained vulnerable to Monterrey’s pace and the strength of Funes Mori. Alisson saved twice from Pabón and again when Funes Mori tried to catch him out with a snap-shot from 30 yards. Monterrey demanded a red card for Gomez when the defender, already booked for hauling down Funes Mori as the last man, was penalised for handball. Antonio Mohamed’s protestations provoked a furious reaction from Klopp who left his technical area to berate the Monterrey coach for appealing for a dismissal. Both managers continued to exchange barbs and were shown yellow cards.“For me it was a red card for the first foul and the second, so I spoke to the ref,” said Mohamed. “Maybe the Liverpool shirt has more weight and therefore the Liverpool player was not sent off.”Klopp introduced the insurance policy of Sadio Mané, Alexander-Arnold and Firmino to avoid extra time. It paid idends when Alexander-Arnold swept an intelligent cross to the near post after good work by Salah and Firmino tucked the winner beyond Barovero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cd5d62fc49da9eb8d58d903b25dd1f0470ef5a/0_0_4704_2822/master/4704.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4e8e4b12817c1ce88330a1cc81aff78","title":"oxford united manchester city carabao cup quarter final match report","story":"Manchester City will continue to fight on four fronts after victory against Oxford United earned Pep Guardiola’s side a mouthwatering match-up against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semi-finals.City had to battle for the win and are digging their heels in over Mikel Arteta, whose presence here dominated the discourse before and after this entertaining contest.Arsenal expect to appoint Arteta as their next manager but Guardiola was prickly when asked about his assistant’s future, with City furious at the club’s conduct, insisting they have not made a formal approach for the Spaniard.City, who have won this competition the past two years, dominated the first half but Oxford made an experimental visiting side sweat in the second half.Oxford had 18 shots – the most City have faced under Guardiola – but could not wrestle their way back into the game after a second-half Raheem Sterling double earned the visitors some breathing space. Sterling, who wore the captain’s armband and operated as a striker here as Guardiola rested eight players, displayed a poacher’s instinct, twice applying the finishing touches inside the six-yard box after Matty Taylor cancelled out João Cancelo’s opener immediately after the restart.Oxford asked questions but City, who have not lost in this competition since defeat to Manchester United in October 2016, held on to maintain their hopes of defending the trophy.The cover of the match-day programme was dedicated to Jim Smith, the former Oxford manager, who last week died at the age of 79. Before kick-off there was a warm minute’s applause and the former Manchester City forward Mike Summerbee and the former Oxford striker Jeremy Charles placed wreaths in tribute to Smith behind the East Stand goal.This was a meeting between two of the country’s biggest entertainers – only West Brom and Peterborough have outscored Oxford in the Football League this season – and Karl Robinson’s side tested a youthful City defence after the break having been kept at arm’s length for much of the first half. “Nervous is not the word but they pushed a lot, they played so well, created lots of chances,” Guardiola said of Oxford. “But we are in the semi‑finals for the third season in a row.”Manchester City will need to beat rivals Manchester United over two legs if they are to defend the Carabao Cup trophy this season.

We just work hard and you take what you get and you do the best out of it.Rodri, one of only three survivors from the starting lineup at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, was instrumental throughout and Cancelo and Riyad Mahrez combined neatly down the right flank but City spent much of the second half repelling Oxford attacks.The celebrations after Sterling struck were low-key – business as usual had been restored – and City had work to do to fend off Oxford, who sensed an air of vulnerability.Tariqe Fosu was a livewire, while Cameron Brannagan, who spent 16 years on the books at Liverpool, showed a touch of class in midfield and Rob Dickie, the Oxford captain, displayed composure in defence in a difficult environment, with a swirling wind making life difficult for both teams.City were in cruise control after Cancelo’s opener, stroking the ball around for fun, successfully sapping Oxford’s energy and belief but the hosts roused themselves immediately after the interval, striking within 21 seconds of the restart.Oxford rippled Claudio Bravo’s net without City getting their mitts on the ball from kick-off a recharged Oxford piled forward down the right, with Shandon Baptiste’s quick thinking outwitting a green City backline, comprising the 17-year-old Taylor Harwood‑Bellis and the 18-year-old Eric García.After being fouled by García, Baptiste’s free-kick released Taylor, the Bristol City loanee, who turned inside Harwood-Bellis before sending a left-foot effort beyond Bravo. Oxford’s joy may have been short-lived – City retook the lead four minutes later – but they gave the Premier League champions a fright.“To take them on at the game they are best in the world at is crazy, stupid but I didn’t want us to roll over and not lay a glove on them,” said Robinson.“If Jim is looking somewhere, I think he would be a very proud man. He built a club with next to nothing and put us in a position at the top of English football.“Our love and thoughts are with his family and we’ll dedicate that performance to him. It had everything he believed in – heart, desire and entertainment – and hopefully we’ve done him proud.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/205114fde118f2654958062279bd871fc209cd22/0_255_7378_4428/master/7378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53bd571856b2d5786b1adfac50fc7fef","title":"my father paid four times his weekly wage for the greatest gift of my life","story":"He bought me and my brother – both of us blind – a tape recorder that dominated Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays, and led to a long and happy careerIt’s eight o’clock on Christmas morning, and Uncle Tom wants to hear the news. My 11-year-old self is wondering why on earth grownups want to hear the news on Christmas Day when there are vital things to be done, such as handing out presents. And then, while I am only half-listening, something weird happens: the Greenwich time pips start. Surely we have already heard those. And then the boring man with the plummy voice begins going on about a Christmas message to the world from the Vatican. Surely that’s been on already, too.It’s my older brother, Colin, who gets it! “Pete, Pete, it’s a tape recorder, you idiot! We’ve got our tape recorder.”The penny drops: Uncle Tom and my dad have recorded the headlines, and are playing them back.I think it’s often quite rare to experience real excitement over a present: in my experience, children are as good as adults at knowing what is expected of them and simulating joyful surprise, even when they don’t feel it. But for me this was one of those rare moments when my insides gave an involuntary lurch and the world did a little somersault.Colin and I had both been blind from birth, and at this point were spending most of our time at a special boarding school, Worcester College for the Blind (now called New College Worcester). In the late 1950s, Britain had just reached the point when exciting consumer goods were coming within reach of the not-really-rich, and at Worcester reel-to-reel tape recorders were definitely the consumer gizmos of choice. For blind kids, they would trump cameras every time, especially at this moment when rock’n’roll was more of a religion than a pastime. For us, you could spot the better-off kids not by the clothes they wore, or the holidays they boasted about, but by the tape recorders they owned. So in our class, Iain Hopkin was marked out as something of a plutocrat by his Brenell recorder. Fortunately for us, Hoppy was a generous soul, and gave us all access to his recordings of Tony Hancock and Peter Sellers.Still, a recorder of your own was the height of aspiration, and Colin – better informed and more realistic about family finances than me – had no real expectations.I realised, much later, that at this time my dad, a very good joiner and carpenter, was probably earning about £8 a week. The tape recorder my parents had bought us, although nowhere near at the top of the range, would have cost more than four times his weekly wage. My parents could only afford it by borrowing the money from Uncle Tom, who had a thriving grocery business. Family or not, I know my mum and dad would have thought long and hard before incurring the debt.The new toy, mains-powered and the size of a small suitcase, dominated the rest of Christmas Day and the remainder of the holidays. Once we had mastered the controls (Colin was the technical one, but was surprisingly patient in sharing his discoveries with me), we recorded everything in sight: each other, our parents, the milkman, the dog … And we very quickly learned the fun to be had at catching people unawares.Uncle Tom, at whose house we were staying over the holiday, got an early reward for his generous loan. Some friends he regarded as a little pretentious were coming over for Boxing Day my aunt and uncle always referred to the husband as “the mayor of Romford”. (Whether that was because he was or just talked as if he was, I’m not sure I ever learned.) Uncle Tom was keen Bill should be made to listen to his chirpy cockney accent, which he claimed he didn’t have. (Things like this mattered 60 years ago.) My task was to record them when they arrived and then at a quiet moment play it back to set Bill straight. Delighted to be trusted in this adult conspiracy of inverted snobbery, I set the machine going as they came up the path. The reaction was more than Uncle Tom could have hoped for I think he decided at that point that his £30-odd investment had already been more than repaid.It wasn’t the first time I had been entranced by a tape recorder. I vividly remember, aged four, coming into a room and hearing a child singing, tunelessly, and raucously. I stopped dead. “It’s you,” Dad said. “Noisy, aren’t you?” I didn’t understand. It turned out that he’d borrowed a tape recorder because he and some friends were writing and performing songs and sketches for his former school’s annual concert. And so for the first time, in the same way that a sighted child might react to seeing themselves in a mirror or a photograph, I got the sense of myself as a separate person, existing outside my head and experienced by other people. It was exciting and embarrassing – not a bad summing-up of my later life as a broadcaster.I really took my first steps down that path when I got back to school after the holidays ended. I was lucky to be in a class of imaginative and creative boys (yes, sadly, Worcester was single-sex then) and it wasn’t long before – all of us radio-obsessed – we started to make our own embryo radio programmes. While studio managers at the BBC were still banging coconuts together to represent horses’ hooves, we were using the little oblong pieces of lead we needed to represent numbers when doing sums to recreate shrapnel for our first world war battles. And very effective they were, dropped on to a desk from a great height.Meanwhile, I would wander round the school with my rudimentary microphone, commenting in the voices of my radio idols – the hushed, reverential tones of Richard Dimbleby, the gravel-voiced war correspondent René Cutforth, and, favourite of all, the mellow Hampshire burr of John Arlott.Most of what I described was pure imagination, although occasionally we would stage real events to heighten the excitement. Particularly memorable was a boxing match between Mick and Geoff (respectively the strongest and the gamest boys in the class, both totally blind. The commentary came from the only one of us with a little bit of sight, in a very passable imitation of the boxing commentator Raymond Glendenning). The strong boy beat the game boy, by the way.The acquisition of the tape recorder coincided with the formation of our own band: Reg Webb, Andy Woods and – yes – Peter White, imaginatively called the W Brothers and destined to be the greatest group ever, had not the Beatles come along and pinched our best material. Reg and Andy were good musicians, and went on to have professional careers. I wasn’t in their musical class, but made up for it with what I thought at the time was my witty banter to introduce our songs. At one of our concerts a girl actually screamed – although it could have been that someone trod on her foot.In fact, the biggest challenge was not finding things to do with the tape recorder but wrestling it away from Colin – it was, after all, a joint present. His generosity on the first day we got it did not extend to his handing it over to his ham-fisted brother at school. I can still hear the phrases: “You’ll break it you’ll lose it you’ll scramble up all the tapes.” And, annoyingly, I did do all of those things. On one fraught occasion, trying in front of an open window to disentangle the hopelessly knotted tape that contained my latest radio gem, I managed to get yards of the stuff enmeshed in an overhanging tree.But 10 years later, by which time I had begun and abandoned a university law course, it was the confidence gained from those early excursions into sound that had me walking into the local radio station in Southampton, trying to sell myself as the next Robin Day. It all nearly ended there, as the receptionist told me there were no vacancies, and that I’d have to apply to the BBC in London “through the normal channels”.Luck intervened. A producer charged with putting together a weekly programme for blind people saw me and my white cane being ushered into the lift. As I prepared to hitchhike my disillusioned way back to university, he rang me at home, and asked if I would go back to Southampton to see him.Twenty-five years after that, I presented my first report for BBC TV’s Six O’Clock News, a date with the telly my dad had never missed. Although by then he’d been dead for more than a decade, I like to think he’d have realised that his inspired Christmas present really had not just changed, but shaped my life.Peter White is the BBC’s disability affairs correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3e8552caf80226a3acc3b93a785826294ec916/0_0_4830_2897/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6b8f0bb385fae486bc838a419dcf6ac","title":"the seven most terrifying christmas traditions around the world","story":"Playful Christmas fun, or sinister, skin-crawling horror? You decideIn most English-speaking countries, the worst fate a naughty child can expect on Christmas is an absence of gifts (or, in the US, coal). Children in other countries, however, can expect worse.Here are seven of the creepiest Christmas traditions around the world.In many European countries, Saint Nicholas has companions who act as a negative counterpart. Saint Nick is the benevolent Good Cop you do not want to meet the Bad Cop.One particularly bad cop is Krampus, a demonic half-goat monster with horns and a long tongue. He drags chains behind him as he walks and rattles them ominously. He carries a birch to whip bad children and sometimes a basket or sack for kidnapping them.The Eve of St Nicholas, 5 December, is Krampusnacht. Hordes of Krampuses march through Alpine towns in elaborate, sinister costumes. In recent years, the Krampuses’ tendency to go on drunken rampages, getting in fights and destroying property, has become a bit of a problem.Frau Perchta is a witch who comes to see who has been naughty or nice. She slits the bellies of bad children and stuffs their corpses with straw. It’s sort of like Santa bringing coal, but with disembowelment instead.Imagine: it is New Year’s Eve. You are a small Welsh child. You hear a knock on the door. You open it. Looming over you is a creature with a horse’s skull, wearing a long, billowing cloak and trailed by people chanting.

During Christmas she emerges to hunt for children, which she kidnaps, takes to her cave, and cooks in a vat of stew.Gryla has a variety of companions, including the Yule Lads – her 13 unruly troll childrenLarge Adult Sons – and the Jólakötturinn, or Yule Cat.Did you think that the Yule Cat sits on your lap as you open gifts, playing with the wrapping paper and contributing to the overall atmosphere of cozy Christmas hygge? Wrong. The Yule Cat is terrifying.Like Satan, walking among us like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour, the massive Yule Cat lopes through town in the dark, peering into the lighted windows of children’s bedrooms. The only way to save yourself from being eaten is to show him that you got clothes for Christmas because you were good this year. If you didn’t get any new clothes, you leave out old clothes, and hope to God they meet his standards.According to Alsatian lore, Hans Trapp was a local man renowned for his greed and unscrupulousness. He used witchcraft and deals with the Devil to become rich. After being excommunicated from the Catholic church, he lost his wealth and social standing. He took to roaming the countryside disguised as a scarecrow.At some point, Hans Trapp became consumed with the idea of tasting human flesh. He lured a shepherd boy to his death, then cooked him over a fire. Before Hans Trapp could take his first bite, however, God – finally feeling that things had gone too far – struck him with lightning.Hans Trapp died, but he returns sometimes on Christmas, to go from door to door looking for young, tasty children.The Kallikantzari are goblins who spend most of the year underground, trying to bring about the apocalypse.

Jesus, does anyone?”The final line of Stand By Me, the classic film about four boys who share everything one summer in the 1950s, comes from the main character as man in his late 30s.We see Gordy hunched in his home study over his computer, with thinning hair and a swelling paunch, ruminating on a time when his days were filled by his three best friends and their endless, circular conversations, excoriating humour and life-and-death adventures. Grown-up Gordy isn’t shown talking to anyone outside his family any more.The movie is one of my all-time favourites, first watched on VHS as a 12-year-old at a sleepover surrounded by my own inseparable group of girlfriends in the late 90s.That last line always stuck with me, as a coda to the story but also as a warning.What it said was that deep, fortifying, true friendship is for the young. Getting older, especially crossing into your 30s and beyond, means forgoing all that intimacy and connection, at least with people outside your family or your marriage.Nostalgia for the close friendships of our youth is very real. Studies show the number of close friends we have begins to drop from the age of 25 as work and relationships take hold, people move cities and countries, and the cliques that once sustained us fall apart. The disrupted modern job market and the way our cities are increasingly designed makes maintaining close human relationships difficult.I’ve felt these shifts and exasperations in my life, and yet I also think the pessimism of my youth was misplaced.I haven’t seen most of the girls at that sleepover since the summer after our HSC when the group splintered as the thing holding us together – high school – came to an abrupt end.But I held on to one, my best friend, with whom I’ve shared a home at different times, innumerable heartaches, family dramas, hospital trips, arguments, beach days, texts, drinks and long periods of time apart.Nevertheless, in different forms, the relationship endures.There is no tight clique any more. In my experience the adult posses of Sex and the City and Friends are as unrealistic as the giant New York apartments. Instead there’s a shifting medley of people – some in clusters, some as iniduals who orbit my life, coming into view only once or twice a year – who I nonetheless value enormously.There is a lot of elasticity in these relationships. They can stretch, occasionally go slack, sadly, but often they snap back better than you might think.Those bonds seem to naturally strengthen depending on the other forces in your life. My sister tells me she has gravitated towards a couple of her oldest friends after nearly a decade when they all had their first babies. “We are so sympathetic to our shared experiences,” she says. Likewise, by the time you’re in your 30s, not having children, and exploring what adulthood might look like without them, can be just as bonding.My sleepover friends all had surnames that started with the letter T, V or W – classes in year seven were organised alphabetically so something as random as your surname largely dictated who you became friends with. My childhood best friend lived around the corner.Adult friendships outside the workplace or your kids’ school pick-ups, at least, can rarely rely on incidental interactions. That makes them hard. They require conscious effort – but that deliberateness can make them feel more special.In my experience technology has aided friendships at this age more than it has diminished them.Group chats at their best are filled with casual intimacies and in-jokes, bearing witness to each others’ lives in small ways, hanging out, even when we’re busy.I’ve made real friends online too. Having some guy slide into your DMs when it’s sleazy and unwelcome is the bane of many women’s lives. But a slide from a woman you think is cool, who wants to get coffee? That makes all the hellacious interactions worthwhile (almost).And while texting and commenting on each others’ posts can be flippant, it also keeps bonds simmering as the opportunities to spend time together diminish.While living overseas for three years, I found even the smallest interactions through social media and messaging apps kept us in each others’ lives, allowing many of the relationships to spring back to life more easily on my return.“Friendship is a relationship with no strings attached except the ones you choose to tie, one that’s just about being there, as best as you can,” wrote Julie Beck in the Atlantic in 2015, in an essay charting shifting friendships through adulthood.I never had friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12 – but now they’re all people I truly chose, and who I keep choosing to share my life with, however we can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc78cee7e6c6faa146ab128d35285e61a5e577e6/0_1262_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cdc542d4c5c6366ef6658688f30c91","title":"howd you like them apples how the science of sleep is helping british apple farmers thrive","story":"Apple author James Rich learns how British growers are using new technology to keep us in perfect pommes all year round Our love affair with them runs far deeper than the apple-a-day proverb further than just something to nourish and keep us healthy – although they are packed with vitamins A and C, magnesium and fibre.They represent fertility in some cultures, wealth and health in others, knowledge, and some of our most celebrated discoveries (hello, gravity). They have permeated culture history, religion, science and technology to be a familiar and reassuring constant in our everyday lives. Quite simply, the apple is more than just a fruit. In fact, Brits buy more than 34,500 tonnes of apples each year (roughly 2.2m apples a week) at Tesco alone.And British apples are some of the best. In the UK, we have the ideal climate and weather to grow perfect pommes. Not only do we have the perfect growing conditions, but our apple growers are some of the most advanced in the world the British apple industry pushes innovation, using the latest technology and equipment to ensure only the tastiest of fruits.Growers include the family owned Adrian Scripps in Kent, which has been specialising in growing “top fruit” (meaning apples and pears) in the garden of England since the 1960s – and has supplied Tesco for more than 30 years. Working with Adrian Scripps, Tesco became the first supermarket to sell British apples all year.Managing director James Simpson explains: “We grow British apples to fill the shelves all year round: gala, discovery, braeburn, kanzi, red prince, jazz …”But apples are a seasonal fruit eating apples especially have a growing season approximately eight-weeks long, generally in September and October. Still, we’ve grown to expect them in our fruit bowls all year round. How do we bridge the gap?Simpson explains that technological advancements mean that British apples can be kept fresh for as long as eight months from the time of picking – stored from September or October right through to May or even June.To do this, the fruit is housed in cold stores (think giant fridges) holding hundreds of tonnes of apples. Here, Simpson and his team can control the atmosphere that the apples are kept in, specifically the natural gases.“The air we breathe is predominantly oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen,” he explains. “By lowering the oxygen level in the air, we can slow down the ripening process that the apples would otherwise go through.“Reducing the oxygen levels, which will ripen the fruit, and increasing nitrogen, which slows down the ripening process, sends the apples in to a dormant state – a form of deep sleep.”This process, which sounds like something straight out of Snow White, is called dynamic controlled atmosphere – a natural process to safely store the fruit until they are ready to be eaten. Simpson likens it to the maturing of cheeses or wines.“The number one priority for us is the eating experience for our customers ensuring we keep the flavour and crisp bite in the apples is the major focus to growers – creating the tastiest, ripest British fruit,” Simpson adds.This also means rotating the varieties on offer. “We work with Tesco to ensure that only the best of the season’s apples are on their shelves at any one time,” says Simpson. “This will change depending on which apple varieties are at their peak at any given time moving from the discovery, which is a more delicate apple and has a shorter store life, early in the season, through to the braeburn, which is hardier and can be stored for longer, later in the season.”Ensuring optimum taste isn’t only about seasonality it’s also about meeting customers’ changing tastes. Tesco sells approximately 50 British apple varieties, introducing new varieties each year, which is where John Worth, Tesco’s master of apples (no less) comes in. Together, Worth and Simpson trial and introduce new varieties of apple – taking up to five years to perfect a flavour.“Right now, customers are looking for great flavour and juiciness, combined with a satisfying crunch as they bite into it,” says Worth on the latest apple created with Simpson. “This meant crossing crisp, modern varieties with the flavour of older varieties. Working with James and his team, the result was the red prince variety: its flavour and texture are enhanced as the natural sugars and acids mature in storage, resulting in a wonderful crispness.”Of course, we can still buy apples from all over the world, but with our expectation for local produce continuing to rise and the need to reduce our global food footprint being more vital than ever, homegrown champions such as Adrian Scripps are defining what shoppers want – filling our baskets with a British bounty of the all-important, and not-so-forbidden fruit.As well as supporting its suppliers in implementing new techniques to enhance freshness, Tesco has an in-house “sensory panel” to help growers across all its fresh food in developing new, flavoursome varieties that taste great and thrive in British climes.

Given the short time-lapse, Thursday’s opening will be a pared-back version, with the Queen arriving by car rather than golden carriage.Unveiling 26 bills in October, the government sought to highlight election-ready plans for tougher jail sentences, among seven bills devoted to law and order.The chosen highlight for Thursday will be a new, largely symbolic bill to put into statute the government’s commitment to spend an extra £33bn-plus a year on the NHS by 2023-24.With Johnson now safely returned to No 10 with an 80-seat majority, one helped by success in many northern English towns that have traditionally voted Labour, the Downing Street focus is now more firmly fixed on the NHS and other austerity-combating spending boosts.The government plans to make the NHS Funding bill the first legislation passed, following scrutiny of the Withdrawal Agreement bill (Wab), which lays down the legal framework for Johnson’s Brexit deal. MPs are due to first vote on this on Friday.Other promised legislation in the Queen’s speech will include easier visa systems for overseas medical staff to enter the UK amid the post-Brexit shakeup of the immigration system and measures to make it simpler for hospitals to manufacture and trial new medicines.Another NHS-based bill will change the current system of hospital car parking charges, abolishing them for groups such as disabled people, those with children who are inpatients, and staff working night shifts.Other elements of the legislative programme remain to be seen. For example, it appears likely that any commitments to maintain EU rights on employment after Brexit will not now be contained in the Wab, but will be laid out in separate legislation.The Wab, expected to be published on Friday, will be amended to include another symbolic legislative element – barring the government from extending the post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020.While Brexit remains a primary focus, in an echo of the simple, repetitive Conservative messages of the election campaign, Johnson and his ministers are seeking to hammer home their policies on supporting the NHS.On Wednesday, Johnson hosted NHS frontline staff for a reception at Downing Street, telling them they were “doing an incredible job”.Citing election-familiar and much-disputed promises to build 40 new hospitals and have 50,000 more NHS nurses, Johnson told the staff: “We are now putting the biggest investment in the NHS in living memory. We have to keep that investment going. We have to keep supporting you.”Emphasising the message, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, used the first major speech by a cabinet minister since last week’s election to talk up the policy of a partial reintroduction of bursary grants for student nurses.Answering questions after the speech in London, Hancock denied that the government was being forced to clear up its own mistakes, after the Conservatives abolished student nurse bursaries in 2016.The announcement of the grants of up to £8,000 a year follows repeated warnings about falls in the number of would-be nurses since the Conservatives abolished the bursaries, also making student nurses pay tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year.But Hancock denied the plan was an admission of error: “This training grant is different to the offer previously. It is more targeted, and in the last few years, when it hasn’t been in place, we have seen the number of nurses increase by 5,000 in the last year. That is good, but 5,000 a year is about half the rate we need to be at to be reaching 50,000.”He said the announcement had been rushed through ahead of the 15 January deadline for university applications. The money, which begins in September 2020, will also be available for those part-way through courses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b291f00c95e7b12710099ae612c1a4f52481b0/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30bd1d76d3b42269c79b22ae44e2138b","title":"why is matt hancock bringing bursaries back for student nurses","story":"The Conservatives abolished nursing grants in 2015 – so is this a U-turn? Until 2016-17 students doing a first degree in nursing received a bursary from the government worth up to £16,454 a year to help boost the NHS’s supply of “homegrown” nurses.That included payment of a student’s tuition fees of up to £9,000 and a maintenance grant of £1,000, neither of which were means-tested. It also included two other forms of support that did depend on the student’s financial circumstances: a maintenance grant of between £2,207, for those living at home, and £3,191, for students living away from home in London.However, in what critics warned was a misguided and reckless move, the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced in the 2015 comprehensive spending review that bursaries for future nurses were being scrapped in favour of loans. Doing so would increase the number of people training to be a nurse, he insisted.Bursaries were removed in England in 2016, although the other UK nations continued to fund them.The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) says the policy has been very damaging and is a key reason why the number of unfilled vacancies in nursing in the NHS in England has risen and now stands at over 43,000.Since then, the number of applications for nursing courses has fallen, which threatens to exacerbate the NHS’s already serious shortage.In May, health experts drawing up the NHS’s forthcoming strategy to tackle understaffing, the People Plan, warned in a leaked early draft of the document that the service’s shortage of nurses could hit almost 70,000 by 2023-24.Applications from first-time students for nursing degrees have dropped from 52,740 in 2016 to 39,665 this year, a fall of 13,075.The number of students starting a nursing course fell from 22,630 in 2016 to 22,045 in 2017 and 21,745 in 2018 but rose again to 23,060 this year.From the next academic year, starting in September 2020, all nursing students in England will get a £5,000-a-year maintenance grant. In addition, those who plan to work in areas with severe shortages of nurses, or in one of the areas of care where the lack of nurses is acute – such as mental health or learning disability care – will receive another £3,000.Johnson is making good on a key pledge he made during the recent general election campaign. He hopes the grants will encourage more people to choose nursing as a career.Matt Hancock, the health secretary – who was an adviser to Osborne in 2015 – denies that.The RCN has welcomed the grants. But it says that that is only “a first victory” in its campaign for the return of full packages of financial support for would-be nurses. It wants the government to also resume paying tuition fees for student nurses. “Any barriers for people wanting to enter nursing must be removed,” said Dame Donna Kinnair, the union’s general secretary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41f608b424d42969d5f0e7ed13b35c658123047/1_0_1612_967/master/1612.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=dd688af50c466fc10b7b29b645e11fb7","title":"food culture tour bethlehem palestine east jerusalem photo essay","story":"Palestinians increasingly see tourism as a way to tell their story, and a trip to Bethlehem and East Jerusalem offers an evocative insight into the hopes and fears of the West Bank communityby  Rebecca Ratcliffe All photographs by Issy CrokerSmells of spices and coffee waft from shop doorways in Bethlehem’s market. Outside limestone buildings, sellers perch under parasols with stacks of sweet ma’moul biscuits and buckets of bright-pink pickled cauliflower, orange loquat fruits and green sour cherries.I’m being shown around by Fadi Kattan, a French Palestinian chef and hotel owner, and Nadine Baboun, co-founder of Farayek, which runs food tours of Bethlehem and East Jerusalem. Kattan tells me that the market, inaugurated in 1929, is a showcase of the best Palestinian food produce.Much of the produce is brought from nearby villages by sellers such as Um Nabil, who has worked in the market for almost four decades. She used to sell dairy products but today she brings vegetables, including boxes of fresh green chickpeas, beans and sacks of herbs. There is the chance to taste almost anything – from Um Nabil’s chunky raw garlic to makdous (tangy aubergine in olive oil with walnuts and carrots) sold at Samer Daoudi’s pickle and dairy shop, which was recently visited by Jamie Oliver.At midday, we sit down at our final stop: Afteem. The restaurant, off Manger Square, is run by a family who fled Jaffa during the period Palestinians mark as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”, when the state of Israel was created and when 700,000 Palestinians were displaced. On the wall hangs a picture of Saliba Salameh, the man who established Afteem in 1948. The restaurant has since become a local institution, and alongside Salameh’s picture are photographs of dignitaries who have since visited to taste its famously light and crispy falafel. There used to be a picture of Tony Blair, says Alaa Salameh, the third generation to run the family restaurant. It had to be taken down because some British guests kept placing napkins over Blair’s head.In Manger Square, tourists are waiting to take tours of the nativity church. Most come on a coach and leave after only a few hours, says Kattan. “They may have a cheap, quick meal. Or they’re taken to a shop that is a Disneyland of everything that has a relation to God,” he adds, referring to the religious souvenir shops. They miss out on much of the town – its market, museums and many restaurants – and rarely go anywhere else in Palestine.“If those people walk around the town and see how we live, it’s a fantastic way to get our real story out,” he says. “Our story to me is anything beyond the perceptions there have been about Palestinians, whether they are the misery side, ‘Oh, the poor Palestinians’, or the fantasy of ‘Oh, Palestine is dangerous’,” says Kattan.Palestinians are especially hospitable because they want outsiders to see their country, he says: “We have a beautiful country and people don’t realise it.” Kattan, who opened a hotel in the town four years ago, is on a mission to change this. Over the next four days he recommends a tour of Palestine’s cultural sites, markets and erse landscape.I’m staying at his hotel, Hosh Al-Syrian (doubles from £63 B\u0026ampB), in a renovated building in the old city, which dates back 1,000 years. Its 12 rooms have arched walls and deep-red carpets. Its adjoining restaurant, Fawda, sources all ingredients from local producers and offers a fusion of French and Palestinian cuisine. It is not designed for pilgrims looking for a bargain room but for people with an interest in Palestinian food, geopolitics and culture.Hosh Al-Syrian is a contrast to Banksy’s much-publicised Walled Off hotel, which opened nearby in 2017. On my first afternoon in Palestine, I visit its museum. Interiors are an uncomfortable mix of lavish British colonial decor and reminders of the occupation. Afternoon tea is served on the patio, in a gilded china teapot, while the grey concrete wall that ides Israel from the Palestinian territories looms opposite. It’s a jarring experience.Some argue that aspects of the hotel trivialise the occupation. There are, says Kattan, plenty of hotels and restaurants that offer a more authentic experience. Local businesses – which have far less financial clout – face the greatest challenges when operating in a volatile political context. Another day, we eat at Abu Eli’s restaurant,  where I’m told the family’s kebabs are so good that his father was once escorted by security to cook for Yasser Arafat (I’m vegetarian, but enjoy a delicious range of salads). Kattan also recommends having a drink in the Rewined bar, but unfortunately, it’s closed when I’m in town.I visit the Bethlehem Historical Museum, established by the town’s Arab Women’s Union, which Kattan’s late grandmother, Julia, helped to found. The association, created in 1947 (during the Arab-Israeli war to provide employment for women and deliver aid to refugees) became a cultural beacon in the city, Kattan tells me. “They opened the first mixed-sex pool in Palestine, the first public library in Palestine,” he says. Many of its projects closed but the museum and food production projects survived. Lots of its exhibits have been donated by local families and show how life in the town has changed: from the designs of homes to traditional clothing.To get from Bethlehem to Jerusalem, tourists must show a passport and visa at a checkpoint, but they don’t face the same travel restrictions as Palestinians living in the West Bank. They have to apply for a permit to enter Jerusalem, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.Heading for Jerusalem, I walk through checkpoint 300 before taking a taxi. In the late morning, there’s only a short queue of families waiting to get through the turnstiles. In the early hours it’s a different story: thousands of Palestinians start queuing as early as 3am to get through in time to start their jobs in Jerusalem.Back in the West Bank, we travel to Sebastia in the north of the territory to view the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. It is believed that the remains of John the Baptist (except for his head, which was apparently taken to Damascus) are buried here in a tomb in the cental courtyard of a mosque whose outside used to be a Crusader church. The site shows the layering of history that has shaped Palestine, says Kattan.From the rooftop of Hosh Al-Syrian there’s a view across all Bethlehem’s churches and mosques. In the early morning, the sound of church bells mingles with the call to prayer. There are several myths about the territory, Kattan adds, including the belief that it is home to just one religion. “It’s varied. Even within each of the inidual religions you have so many small communities where the traditions are different,” he says. “It’s one of the places where you learn more about brotherhood between religions … historically all faiths have lived together here.”On the walls of the dining area hang colourful patterned plates made by the famous Jerusalem Pottery, a business run by an Armenian family, part of the erse range of communities in East Jerusalem.• The trip was provided by Hosh Al-Syrian, Amos Trust (a small, creative human rights organisation) and Zaytoun, a social enterprise and community interest companyLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Quite a lot, actually, when it is the Starbucks cup that made the most high-profile cameo in Game of Thrones since Ed Sheeran appeared as a Lannister soldier. No cultural artefact assumed a greater significance in 2019 than the Starbucks cup. An HBO staffer came, they frapped, then all hell broke loose. Will we ever solve 2019’s most enduring mystery?First: a recap. Before the Starbucks cup became the cup, it was just a cup, left by a cast or crew member during a break in filming. It was the US YouTuber Zane Hijazi who spotted the error during the premiere of season eight’s fourth episode, The Battle of the Starks. Pandemonium ensued. In the scene, the Stark and Targaryen forces are carousing after winning the Battle of Winterfell. Enter stage left: the cup. “My favourite show in the entire world forgot a STARBUCKS COFFEE CUP ON THE TABLE WHILE FILMING,” Hijazi tweeted. The clip has been retweeted 146,000 times, and had more than half a million likes. Presumably none of those came from the HBO post-production team who failed to spot the offending receptacle and edit it out of the show.At first, Emilia Clarke seemed the most obvious culprit – she was sitting right beside it. But then Clarke went full Littlefinger on Conleth Hill. “We had a party before the Emmys recently,” Clarke said on Jimmy Fallon, “and Conleth, who plays Varys, who’s sitting next to me in that scene, he pulls me aside and he’s like: ‘Emilia, I have got to tell you something, love. The coffee cup was mine.’” Hill issued a robust denial. “I would need to have had Mr Man arms to leave a coffee cup there,” he told Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch. “I took a bullet for Emilia Clarke and she touted on me.” After the initial backstabbings, HBO’s cast and crew closed ranks – their lips are as sealed as Ned Stark’s were on Jon Snow’s true parentage. The mystery lives on.How can we explain our mania for the mistake and the cover-up? First, it has all the elements of a classic whodunnit: intrigue, ignominy and actors in period dress. Second, it is highly shareable – Photoshopped memes of the cup circulated endlessly on social media. And third, it is a bit of jollity amid an otherwise overwhelmingly negative response to the show’s final season, which suffered a drubbing from fans and critics.Personally, I think #cupgate took root because we are pernickety idiots who love to think we would never make a mistake on that scale and actually could do a far better job of things. (See also: the ridiculous petition to remake season eight, set up by an aggrieved fan.) It is also a reminder that even the biggest TV shows get it wrong. To err is human. To leave a Starbucks cup in Westeros, ine.And on the deathless question of whodunnit? I think it was Samwell Tarly, in the library, framing Daenerys after she flame-roasted his dad and brother. Next time – use a reusable mug. Disposable cups are so 2009.The Hot Priest rocked the Catholic church. There was an extreme and troubling tourist boom in Chernobyl.

If approved, it would be allowed to roughly double the amount of toxic emissions in the parish annually.The project is opposed by a group of community activists in the majority African American parish, who argue the emissions would prove an intolerable health risk. The revelations on the site’s historic significance has further angered residents, many of whom trace their ancestry back to enslavement in the region.The discovery of slave burial grounds on industrial land in the heavily polluted region between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, known colloquially as “Cancer Alley”, has happened in the past. But the revelations are likely to intensify the fight in one of the most contentious new developments in the region.Sharon Lavigne, a resident opposed to the development, said the discovery of the cemeteries was “gut-wrenching” and made the proposed site “hallowed ground”.“I have buried so many family members and friends who have died from cancer. Our community cannot handle another chemical plant,” Lavigne said.Formosa is currently navigating the approval process with state authorities and as part of this quietly commissioned archaeological research on the land earmarked for development.Although initial cultural surveys conducted by the company in 2018 had indicated there were not historically significant sites on the land Formosa plans to build on, the company were later alerted to maps from the late 19th century – submitted to the state’s ision of archaeology by an independent researcher – that indicated two cemeteries tied to old plantations on the land.According to hundreds of pages of emails, reports and surveys released under freedom of information laws to lawyers working for community activists and reviewed by the  before publication, Formosa has found one of these sites, the Buena Vista cemetery, is still intact.Any evidence of the other, listed as the Arcadia cemetery, could not be located by excavators working for a contractor, who believe that either any human remains or other physical signs of grave sites have been destroyed by construction carried out by previous land users or that the cemetery may never have existed.It was still unclear how many bodies were held in the graveyard, about an acre in size. Historical records of the lives and deaths of the millions of people enslaved in the United States are scant and often non-existent.The Buena Vista site sits in a so-called project “buffer zone”, meaning no construction is planned there, despite Formosa owning the land.Janile Parks, director of community and government relations for the Formosa project, said the company has now “fenced in the identified area to protect it”. She added that Formosa had “conducted archival research and has not been able to connect the plot to anyone or any particular event”.She said: “As the project progresses, Formosa will follow all applicable state and federal laws in regards to the burial ground and public notification.”Internal emails suggest that the Arcadia site posed more of an issue to the Formosa project as the old maps indicated it sat directly underneath an area proposed for construction.Lawyers working for Formosa acknowledged in August 2018 that if human remains were recovered at this site the company “could choose to protect the area from any further construction disturbance with a fence and plaque” but noted that this “would mean that portions of the planned utilities plant may have to be relocated” a move that would be “a very difficult option”. The emails indicate that Formosa favored removing remains and relocating them to another cemetery. Contractors later recovered no remains from the site.It is expected that Formosa will continue its construction plans with this site, a state official said.Residents in St James expressed frustration that Formosa did not notify community members about the discovery of the sites, particularly before the parish council approved permits in December 2018.Formosa said it had “conducted all field work in coordination with the appropriate agencies” including the State Historic Preservation Office. It described the review as a “lengthy and regulated process”.Lavigne, the founder and president of Rise St James, argued that the cemetery revelations should thwart the Formosa project entirely.“I feel like God is answering my prayers,” said Lavigne. “This will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.”She said the group plans to use the new information on potential slave burial sites to ask the parish council to reconsider permits already approved for the Formosa project.Still, it’s unlikely the grave sites will seriously impact Formosa’s progress, state officials said.Greg Langley, press secretary for the Louisiana department of environmental quality (LDEQ), a state permitting agency, said he couldn’t comment specifically on outstanding permits for Formosa. But he said: “Normally this type of situation would not affect the permits.”Formosa is awaiting a decision from LDEQ on its proposed air permit before it can begin construction.Spees, meanwhile, highlighted the need for a more thorough investigation of historical assets on the land as industrial development continues to grow in Cancer Alley.“They are putting these industries on land where we know there are people buried,” she said. “How many have already been destroyed along this stretch? What do we need to do to really acknowledge and preserve and protect these types of burial sites?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abc74f49f62ab104f7b70dfafeb7eddc7df62e33/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c8cebab104b43b2a6be06cc80d4ac6","title":"native american women trafficked searchlight new mexico","story":"Nearly a quarter of New Mexico’s trafficking victims are Native American – and women and girls are the least protected as the state struggles to address the problemEva was found at dusk in late December 2016, standing in an Albuquerque parking lot. The 15-year-old Navajo girl had been missing more than two weeks when her grandmother got a call from the Bernalillo county sheriff’s office – saying her silver Ford truck had been recovered.“I don’t care about the truck, what about my granddaughter?” Heidi demanded.She drove three hours, from her house outside Gallup, and arrived a few minutes after 1am to see Eva emerge from the juvenile holding area, quiet and hunched. Her cheeks and neck looked skeletal. She kept her answers short and rolled her eyes. A familiar pattern was unfolding.Back in the car, Heidi locked the doors. Give me my phone, Eva said.A 16-month investigation by Searchlight New Mexico has found that when it comes to human trafficking, indigenous women and girls are the least recognized and least protected population in a state that struggles to address the problem. An almost total lack of protocols, mandated training and coordination among law enforcement systems and medical institutions has ensnared victims in ongoing cycles of exploitation.That includes Eva, who, by her own recounting as well as notes from medical personnel, caseworkers and therapists, was systematically lured, coerced, threatened and traded for sex for money, drugs and favors over a two-year period. Her name, along with those of her family members, have been changed for reasons of safety and privacy.Eva showed many of the warning signs of someone who has been trafficked. She was anxious, depressed, mute and had little sense of time. She was frequently reported missing, appeared malnourished and occasionally bruised. But despite multiple brushes with law enforcement agencies and healthcare institutions, she was not once questioned or screened for human trafficking.“Nobody saw me,” she says. “Not until the very end.”Growing up on the Zuni and Navajo reservations of western New Mexico, Eva moved continuously between her mother’s home and that of her grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. The only constant in her life was Haley, her sister four and a half years her junior.Eva was the effusive one, admired for her lanky limbs and her gift for sketching. She was the one to initiate games of basketball in the driveway, scolding her cousins when they didn’t pass the ball to Haley.The girls’ mother, Lea, worked multiple jobs as a nurse’s aide, and the family had a comfortable life in an area where the median household income hovers at $27,000 a year. Lea entered the girls in child beauty pageants in the big cities of Gallup, Albuquerque and Las Cruces. She was the kind of mother who on a whim would take them on a road trip to White Sands Monument or the redwood forests of northern California.That all changed the year Eva turned 11. Lea had long struggled with alcoholism, and as the disease worsened she increasingly left her daughters in the care of others or alone at home. When she was too intoxicated to drive, she propped Eva on a pile of blankets to see over the steering wheel of the family’s 1999 Honda Civic. Eva began skipping school, where she got in trouble for smoking. In seventh grade, she was expelled for fighting and never went back.Only later would Eva and Haley confide in their grandmother that their stepfather physically, sexually and emotionally abused them. “Don’t you tell Grandma what happens in this house,” he often said.Heidi said she kept as close a watch as she could, and when she saw them, she would give the girls almost anything they wanted. For Eva’s 12th birthday, her grandmother bought her an iPhone, so Eva could call whenever they were left alone at home.“Buying her that phone was the worst thing I ever did,” Heidi says now.On 8 December 2015, Eva saw a Facebook message from a young man with a thick brow and a round jawline. “I remember you from middle school,” he wrote. Eva, then 13, didn’t recognize him, but she assumed she knew him. “Everyone on the reservation knows everyone,” she says. “Or they pretend they do.”D, as she came to call him, enthused about her large brown eyes, her dimples and the way she wore her hair in French braids. He asked for photos and she sent him intimate selfies, soon followed by more explicit pictures. She eventually drove to his house in her mother’s car – propped up on blankets – and they drank beer and smoked marijuana. D told her he loved her, and Eva felt needed and exultant, unmoored from the problems at home.As the months went by, he took more photos and recorded videos – usually of Eva performing oral sex. His affectionate ways were soon supplanted by forceful sex, violence and threats. He threatened to share his photos and videos on Facebook and hurt her little sister if she were to say anything. He invited other men – he said they were his brother and cousin – to the house, where they also molested and raped Eva. She remembers initially resisting, punching one of them, and hearing the words “Just do it” before a weight fell on her.In the fall of 2016, D redoubled his threats against Eva, promising to harm her grandmother and abduct her sister if she spoke out. If anyone could have helped Eva, it would have been her mother. Lea knew, or at least suspected, what was happening she had seen the nude photos of her daughter and did nothing. Then in November, she died after an incident near Shiprock.For weeks after the funeral Eva lay on the floor of her grandmother’s house, while her phones buzzed with messages. By now, she had four Samsung cellphones, all supplied by D, who texted daily, demanding more photos, threatening violence unless she picked herself off the ground and met him. Which she did, as if pulled by a wire tethered to her feet – driving or being driven to faraway towns and switching between cars with strange men.Sex trafficking is defined as the exploitation of iniduals through threat or use of force, coercion andor fraud to induce a “commercial sex act”. It is a growing crime that’s estimated to generate $99bn a year globally, and in the US, people of color – mostly black and indigenous women – are victimized at the highest rates.But the mainstream definition need to be reshaped when considering the ways indigenous women and girls are victimized, says Maureen Lomahaptewa, a Hopi woman and caseworker at the Life Link, a Santa Fe-based not-for-profit that shelters and serves trafficking victims..This year, the Navajo nation council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty spearheaded an as yet unpublished white paper on trafficking in the Navajo nation. It is intended to serve as a warning to policymakers – though not all tribal leaders regard the issue with the same urgency. The Navajo nation police chief, Philip Francisco, for one, says he does not see sex trafficking as a problem in his jurisdiction. “It’s more of a border issue,” he says.Of course, trafficking and exploitation are hardly a new phenomenon in indigenous communities. For centuries, sexual violence has been a cornerstone of the treatment of Native American populations, integral to colonization and displacement. Sex trafficking of contemporary indigenous women is “almost indistinguishable from the colonial tactics of enslavement, exploitation, exportation and relocation”, writes Sarah Deer, professor of law at Kansas University and author of The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America.Today, high rates of chemical dependency, abuse and involvement in the foster care system exacerbate vulnerability to predators, the vast majority of whom are non-Native. As noted in Crotty’s white paper, female minors, homeless youth and transgender or two-spiritLGBTQ+ people are most vulnerable to trafficking. And, as tribal leaders have found in NDFS cases, family members have been known to exchange younger children for money, drugs or basic needs. “We’ve seen our children trafficked by their own family, and most don’t even know they were trafficked,” says Crotty.After conducting more than 75 interviews and gathering data from 18 agencies, Searchlight shared Eva’s story with nine tribal police officers, four tribal officials and two former clinicians for the Indian Health Service. No one expressed surprise.“Tribal agencies are understaffed, underfunded and undertrained in this type of response,” says Darren Soland, Ramah Navajo police chief. “Once someone who is being victimized goes from tribal to state land or to a municipality and maybe comes back, it’s hard to get the agencies to reach out and communicate with each.”A July 2019 study in the journal Criminology \u0026amp Public Policy explored the reasons why law enforcement officers rarely recognize trafficking victims and found that some say they are unaware that this is a crime over which they have jurisdiction while others don’t believe it is an issue present in their communities. The majority of states, including New Mexico, require no law enforcement training on human trafficking.And while lawmakers have proposed legislation, their efforts have largely stalled. The renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, which would better assist indigenous victims and increase cross-agency communication, is stalled in the US. Senate.In a written response to questions, a spokesperson from the FBI’s New Mexico headquarters wrote: “The FBI is committed to fulfilling our mandate to investigate the most serious crimes in Indian Country … The FBI aggressively investigates any reports of human trafficking, using force-multiplying Human Trafficking Task Forces.”“We’re letting the FBI off the hook way too easily,” said Mary Kathryn Nagle, a Cherokee Nation lawyer and counsel to the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center. “And I wish more senators would call them to account for how few investigations go anywhere. They need to have an oversight hearing on why the FBI is abdicating its duties.”In December 2016, Eva was handcuffed outside a Dollar Store in north-east Albuquerque for stealing her grandmother’s truck, and placed in a 90-day program at Butterfly Healing Center, a co-ed treatment center for Native American teens in Taos. That’s where, at last, she began to talk.Her disclosure set in motion a string of reports that reverberated across agencies and culminated in a three-hour interview with the FBI. To date, no charges have been filed.In the last 14 months since departing a safe house, Eva, now 18, and Haley, 13, have each enrolled in two new schools and changed apartments three times. Eva has gone missing once. She has also been arrested once.Many nights, she resists sleep. Nightmares ensue, and the sensation of near-sleep reminds her of the feeling she experienced when she was being trafficked – weightless and contorted underwater.“I want to make it not real. But I was living there. And sometimes, I’m still living there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d713c0328a491eba16b5bf5073fdf5be540116b/51_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee4ccae4b0695491d697d11db9d3434f","title":"wakanda usda trade agriculture black panther","story":"Agriculture department says fictional country from Marvel movies was used to test systems and was not meant to remain visibleTrade talks between Captain America and Black Panther didn’t quite pan out, it seems.

Two-time election winner Joseph Muscat announced his resignation earlier this month, after it emerged his chief of staff was about to be questioned by police in connection with the case.A European parliament press statement to accompany the resolution was more direct: “Maltese prime minister should resign now.” But the parliament retracted that statement a few hours later, returning to the more cautious wording of the resolution described by one source as “a very roundabout way of saying he should resign now”.The resolution was approved by 581 of the 690 MEPs who voted in Strasbourg, with 83 voting against and 26 abstaining.MEPs also raised concerns about corruption and money-laundering on the island, while lamenting that a makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia in the Maltese capital was cleared away every day. It called on Muscat to put an “an immediate stop to the near-daily destruction of the makeshift memorial in Valletta”.The wide-ranging resolution was co-drafted by a cross-party trio of MEPs, who took part in an emergency mission to Malta early this month, after progress into the police investigation prompted the resignation of Muscat’s chief of staff, Keith Schembri.Schembri, who masterminded two election victories for Muscat, has been arrested and released without charge twice in connection with the case. The prime suspect in the murder, the Maltese tycoon Yorgen Fenech, told a court Schembri gave him updates about the police investigation. Fenech has pleaded not guilty to complicity in the murder and all other charges linked to the case. Schembri has denied all wrongdoing.The resolution, supported across the political spectrum, states that the parliament “deeply regrets that developments in Malta in recent years have led to serious and persistent threats to the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights including freedom of the media, the independence of the police and judiciary and the freedom of peaceful assembly”.The language deliberately echoes that of the EU treaty’s article 7 on the rule of law, which could lead to a member state being stripped of voting rights if a “serious and persistent” breach of democratic values is found.But the parliament stopped short of triggering the EU sanctions procedure. This procedure, currently being used against Poland and Hungary, is increasingly seen as ineffective, because it relies on EU member states acting against one of their own.Article 7 “is a cannon without gunpowder”, the German Green MEP Sven Giegold, who co-drafted the resolution, said. “It is wiser to have several shots open rather than start with the loudest weapon and waste it.”In a statement following the vote, Giegold said: “The European commission can no longer turn a blind eye to the culture of impunity when it comes to money laundering and corruption in Malta. The newly elected commission must begin dialogue with the Maltese government on the rule of law with a view to commencing article 7 proceedings, if no immediate progress is made from the Maltese side.”Earlier this week, the EU commissioner for justice, Didier Reynders, urged the Maltese government to speed up work to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, tackle corruption and set up a prosecution service free from any control by the prime minister. These were all identified as problems by experts at the Council of Europe, a separate body to the EU. “Recent controversies have underlined that progress should accelerate,” Reynders wrote to the Maltese justice minister, Owen Bonnici. “Clarity about the steps and timetable ahead would be the best way to make clear that the commitments of the Maltese government to progress will be taken forward.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d41c804500b07312d5dd3d80c153738bc0dbd7/0_341_5733_3440/master/5733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e4532ef151bf66e76c5efe5130a378","title":"its a little worn paris champs elysees in line for 250m make over","story":"Plan to restore avenue to former glory will be presented to candidates standing in January’s municipal electionsThe Champs-Élysées, often called the “most beautiful avenue in the world”, is not what it was. The pavements are cracked, the trees that line the cobbled, traffic-clogged road struggle to survive in one of Paris’s most polluted areas, and Parisians stay away.Now local community leaders have unveiled an ambitious €250m (£212m) project to restore the celebrated 1.2 mile (1.9km) long avenue to at least some of its former glory.“It’s often called the world’s most beautiful avenue, but those of us who work here every day are not at all sure about that. The Champs-Élysées has more and more visitors and big name businesses battle to be on it, but to French people it’s looking worn out,” Jean-Noël Reinhardt, president of the Champs-Élysées committee said.Reinhardt says his association, which represents those who live, work and trade on the avenue running from the Arc de Triomphe on Place Charles de Gaulle to Place de la Concorde, will present their plans to the candidates standing in next year’s municipal elections in January.The Champs-Élysées makeover would need public and private investment, he told journalists.The Champs-Élysées was originally a mixture of swamp and kitchen gardens when André Le Nôtre, gardener to Louis XIV the Sun King, first laid out the wide promenade lined with a double row of elm trees on each side, called the Grand Cours. In 1709, it was renamed the Champs-Élysées and extended, and by the end of the century had become a popular place to walk and picnic.The city celebrated its liberation from the Nazis in 1944 on the Champs-Élysées and World Cup victories still bring out the crowds, but its famous charm has faded. Today it is known for its expensive cafes, luxury shops, high-end car salesrooms and commercial rents that are among the highest in the world, as well as the annual Bastille Day military parade. More recently it was the scene of some of the most violent clashes between gilets jaunes and riot police.Its name is French for the mythical Greek paradise, the Elysian Fields but Parisians largely shun it.Chiambaretta said it needed to be developed to be “ecological, desirable and inclusive”.“It was always designed for the people and shouldn’t just be a luxury avenue,” Chiambaretta said.He admitted the Champs-Élysées had become a place that summed up the problems faced by cities around the world: “Pollution, the place of the car, tourism and consumerism.”The ambitious plans include reducing the space for vehicles by half, creating tunnels of trees and encouraging more aesthetic use of commercial spaces such as terraces. The committee also wants a major rethink of the area all around the Champs-Élysées to make it more pedestrian friendly up to and including the nearby River Seine, with traffic erted into a tunnel.“We work here every day so we know we have to profoundly change things. We can’t just say it’s the responsibility of the public authorities. We want the Champs-Élysées to remain a centre of attraction in the world, we want tourists to keep coming but we want the Parisians who used to come here 100 years ago to come back,” Reinhardt said.Plans to improve the Champs-Élysées are not new, but as Paris prepares to host the 2024 Olympics, there is an impetus to spruce up the city’s most celebrated street before the world descends.A Paris city hall spokeswoman said the Champs-Élysées is already closed to traffic one Sunday every month and the city authorities had already carried out work including a cycle lane on the avenue.Chiambaretta says some of the work could begin after next year’s elections, but the wider project would have to wait until after the games.Futuristic sketches showing the Arc de Triomphe surrounded by sand and water or transformed into an ice rink are, Chiambaretta admits, probably a pipe dream.Giving the Champs Élysées and its surroundings a makeover is not, he says. “We have to think big and not just about the Champs-Élysées, but all around it,” he says.The proposals are in the early stages and would need the approval of the Paris authorities and public investment. City Hall did not wish to comment on the plans drawn up by the committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05cb2800ea48850f58b53c12fa2be251ff447a55/0_0_3479_2088/master/3479.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4e8adfaf63bc02f6017ac849bc382f","title":"members of angela merkels party found to have far right links","story":"CDU criticised for allegedly failing to guard against neo-Nazis and ‘prepper’ infiltrationPressure is mounting on the leadership of Angela Merkel’s conservative party to fortify its “firewall against the far right”, as more members of the Christian Democratic Union were revealed to be members of a shadowy military network with links to “prepper” or survivalist circles.Last week a member of the CDU’s executive committee in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld, Robert Möritz, confirmed that he was a member of Uniter, a private support network for active and former soldiers and security personnel.In the wake of the assassination of the pro-refugee politician Walter Lübcke and a white supremacist’s planned terror attack on a synagogue in Halle, security circles have raised alarm about rightwing extremist attempts to infiltrate the military and police.While Uniter remains a legally registered association and is currently not on any of the intelligence agencies’ official watchlists, its founder André Schmitt is on trial for offences against Germany’s weapons and explosives act.Uniter’s founder also set up and administered a complex command chain of Telegram chat networks, in whose subgroups so-called preppers discussed plans to build up parallel infrastructures in preparation for the anticipated collapse of the prevailing social order.Some of the chats, which were ided into regional districts, covered the threat of Islamist terrorist attacks and how to respond to them by hoarding weapons, munitions and food supplies. Other prepper groups have been accused of compiling “death lists” of leftwing and pro-refugee targets, as well as ordering body bags and quicklime to dispose of their victims after a “Day X” doomsday scenario.So far the CDU’s branch in Saxony-Anhalt has declined to expel the ex-Uniter member Möritz, in spite of him admitting to taking part in a neo-Nazi rally in 2011 and carrying a “black sun” tattoo on his right arm, a symbol which has been adopted by neo-Nazis and occultists. The CDU’s district leader in Anhalt-Bitterfeld insisted the 29-year-old had “credibly” distanced himself from his rightwing extremist past.Uniter’s enmeshment with the eastern offices of Germany’s dominant political party of the postwar era is more intricate than previously known, however. Kai Mehliss, a member of the CDU’s hardline “conservative circle” who also sits on the district branch in Anhalt-Bitterfeld, is listed on Uniter’s website as a member and organised a roundtable event for the network as recently as last week. Like Möritz, he has since cancelled his membership.Another CDU member, a town councillor in the municipality of Sandersdorf-Brehna, was a founding member of Uniter in its original incarnation in 2012, before the association was founded anew in Stuttgart.The local politician said on Wednesday that he co-founded Uniter to help elite German soldiers find employment after they had been deployed abroad, and claimed not to know the other two Uniter members in his party personally. Since Saturday, his profile appears to have been removed from the CDU’s website.The revelations came on the eve of what is likely to be Angela Merkel’s last full year as German chancellor, and as the country nervously eyes her party’s political direction in the post-Merkel era.While Merkel’s successor at the head of the CDU, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is a politician in the chancellor’s liberal mould, conservative politicians in the eastern states have agitated for the party to drop its cordon sanitaire against coalitions with the rightwing populist Alternative für Deutschland.The general secretary of Merkel’s junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party, on Wednesday accused Kramp-Karrenbauer of failing to crack down on far-right tendencies in her party.“What we are seeing in the CDU’s Saxony-Anhalt branch is a bursting of the dam against the far right,” Lars Klingbeil told Tagesspiegel newspaper. Social Democrat politician Ralf Stegner, meanwhile, said events in Saxony-Anhalt showed “the firewall against the far right is crumbling”.The veteran conservative and former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble said that “democratic parties, and especially the party of which I am a member, must not have anything to do with neo-Nazis”. But many senior figures in the party have stopped short of explicitly calling for the expulsion of members with a neo-Nazi past.The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, at the start of this week announced 600 new intelligence positions for weeding out potentially violent rightwing extremists and their networks. But opposition politicians say the search will have to start at the door of Seehofer’s own agencies.One founding member of Uniter in its 2016 incarnation, Ringo M, used to work for the domestic intelligence agency in Baden-Württemberg, while one of Uniter’s four district leaders has been training police at a police academy in Brandenburg.Armin Schuster, a CDU chairman of the Bundestag’s committee on internal affairs, rejected claims that German security had a “large-scale problem” with the far right, but conceded some of the recent revelations had been troubling. “What we are seeing is a number of isolated suspicious cases, and every single one of them is one too many for me,” Schuster told the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b725340b76d702c9a5be3ab32bba53151febec02/159_94_794_476/master/794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed56777666147ce813c0e62a1568bce9","title":"tell us what you want to do in your last year as an eu citizen","story":"British citizens will cease to be EU citizens from December 2020.

If you are interested to live a life with a group of interesting people it can be a new life for you,” the advertisement says.“You can enjoy walking, fishing, shopping, kayaking, bird watching, swimming or looking at the nice animals.”Reipen says adults aged up to 70 can apply, and are also welcome to bring their own horses to the property.According to the local newspaper, the Taranaki Daily News, Reipen made his fortune selling canned iced coffee, and has substantial business and property interests in New Zealand, as well as internationally.His Awakino property was purchased prior to the Ardern government’s ban on foreign home buyers, but still required the sign-off of the Overseas Investment office, which consented to the sale as they said the businessman had the means and ability to transform the land, and care for it.In the advertisement, Reipen states that he has a background in “international business” but has always enjoyed working on farms in Germany.

Photograph: Nick BradshawMore than a million turkeys will be eaten in Ireland in the days ahead but while the birds remain an enduringly popular festive treat, many of those involved in producing and selling them are having anything but a happy Christmas. Robbie Fitzsimons is a third generation turkey farmer in east Cork. He has serious doubts there will be a fourth generation Fitzsimons involved in his business despite the fact that he has an 11-year-old son who dreams of taking over his father’s farm one day. “All my son wants to be is a poultry farmer like me but I don’t believe any of my children will be involved in the business,” he says. “I look at my son and can’t see how he will be able to make a living doing what I do. And that’s very sad to say.”He says the blame for difficulties in the industry lies with retailers who have been driving down the price of turkey for years.Consumers also share some responsibility, he says, as they increasingly believe all food – no matter how much it costs to produce – should always be available at rock bottom prices. “I don’t think the public realise how food is produced any more and how much it costs to produce it. They also think that everything they see that is labelled ‘turkey’ is the same and that is a major problem,” he says. “There is a major problem with turkey breast meat being imported into this country and then taken out of vacuum bags and without the consumer having any idea where is has originated and how old it is.”Day-old chicksFor Fitzsimons, turkey season started over the August bank holiday weekend when all his day-old chicks arrived from the UK. They cost him about €8 each. To that price he has had to add the cost of feed, labour and housing the birds for around five months before they are sold. Some cut-price supermarkets have started selling turkeys for as little as €9. But turkeys available at that price are small and frozen and they have almost certainly not been produced by Irish farmers. Fitzsimons says these low prices create the impression in consumers’ minds that turkey is cheap to produce. “But it really is not,” he stresses. “A quality turkey costs between €26 and €40 to produce, so even when a supermarkets is selling it for €25 and €30, they can only be breaking even. We cannot compete with those prices and are going to go out of business even though we are producing a great product that people want to eat.“We might have a turkey that cost €40 to produce and so we need to sell it for €50 to make a margin but people see the low prices elsewhere and wonder what we are at. There are farmers who are going to die paupers even though they are producing great food.”Fitzsimons is not the only one expressing concern as Christmas comes closer. “We are not selling nearly as many turkeys as we used to and that’s because we have to compete with the prices in supermarkets that are just too low,” says Paddy Buckley of FX Buckley on Dublin’s Moore Street. ‘Absolute disgrace’He pays turkey producers about €5 per kilo for his product, which means a 6.5kg bird costs him about €33. “I can’t sell that for €25 to match the supermarket prices. It is an absolute disgrace the price they are selling the turkeys for. A huge amount of work goes into producing a turkey and it is absolutely ridiculous to see them for sale for as low as €8.99.” Despite their price, the very cheapest turkeys do not represent good value for money. The bone structure of a 6.5kg turkey and a 3.2kg turkey is roughly the same, so all the extra weight on the bigger bird is meat. Buckley says turkey crowns are increasingly popular and he expects a “mad rush” between December 21st and Christmas Eve. He says that in spite of the temptation of the cheaper fowl on supermarket shelves, many people are still willing to pay extra for a good fresh turkey. “The trick is not to eat too much of it in the run-up to Christmas. If you buy a decent fresh turkey that has been looked after well, and wait until Christmas Day to have it, then you are going to absolutely love it,” he says. Washing turkeysBut while the turkey remains popular, it is not entirely problem-free. Earlier this month, Safefood published details of a survey which showed that in spite of warnings published each year, as many as 40 per cent of Irish people persist in washing their turkeys before cooking them, which can contribute to the spread of harmful bacteria.  Irish Water has pleaded with people not to pour turkey grease down the sink, warning that it can create all sorts of problems, not least the build-up of “fatbergs” which can cause huge blockages across the infrastructure in the days and weeks after Christmas Day."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ireland and Lithuania only two EU countries not to offer state funding for assisted reproductionMove comes as number of military personnel falls again despite \u0026euro10m boost to allowancesMove by department aims to ensure pupils with disabilities can access helpPeople travelling by car or motorcycle will only see cost of using M3 route rise next yearRegulator advises council to reduce amount of land planned for rezoning in BallybunionBirdbrained? \u0026lsquoIt is absolutely ridiculous to see them for sale for as low as \u0026euro8.99\u0026rsquoStaff using GoFundMe page because \u0026lsquoGovernment funding is not available\u0026rsquoAlternative models should be \u0026lsquofully explored as a matter of priority\u0026rsquo says comptrollerEngagement with arts every few months lowers risk of dying by 31 per cent, study findsNumber of protected birds has dropped by 85 per cent since the 1970sOpposition criticise failure to set targets to ensure 20 per cent of public service recruits competent in IrishUnwelcome prospect of continued unsettled weather ahead of Christmas breakUnions say staffing levels are unsafe with about 2,800 vacancies in nursingHaulage industry representative\u0026rsquos byelection campaign became embroiled in controversyHealth is a matter for the North\u0026rsquos politicians yet Stormont has been mothballed for almost three yearsZappone denies funding of \u0026euro1,500 is a bailout to deal with rising premiumsGovernment to appoint 1,000 additional medical specialists over next 10 yearsPublic support healthcare workers by sounding car horns and offering hot drinks and food"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4119024.1576659880!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"border residents feel overwhelming uncertainty due to brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA lorry passes an anti-Brexit billboard seen on the Dublin-Newry road last October. Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via Getty ImagesMany people living along the Border have an “overwhelming feeling of uncertainty” as a result of Brexit, according to a new report by researchers at Queen’s University, Belfast (QUB) and the Irish Central Border Area Network (ICBAN). Those surveyed also described how Brexit had already had an economic and social impact on their lives and future plans, and had put off making financial or business decisions, or had experienced major changes such as the loss of a job or problems in labour recruitment because of Brexit. Many felt a “related sense of insecurity” which was “exacerbated by ongoing speculation about what the future for the Border might be.” The Border Into Brexit: Perspectives from Local Communities in the Central Border Region of IrelandNorthern Ireland is the third in a series of reports by QUB, in association with ICBAN, which study the views of Border residents on Brexit. More than 500 people from Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan and Sligo in the Republic of Ireland, as well as those in the council areas of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Fermanagh and Omagh and Mid Ulster in Northern Ireland, contributed to the research. The report also described a “feeling of lack of political representation and voicelessness which exacerbates the sense of anxiety.” “I feel very angry that there is no one to represent my voice in the UK Parliament - and also in our local Assembly,” said one respondent. “This is the area and the people that are likely to be most affected and where are the leaders representing us?” The first phase of the research was carried out before the Brexit deadline on October 31st, when the risk of a no deal Brexit appeared highest, while the second phase was conducted after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had concluded his revised Withdrawal Agreement with the EU and Britain’s withdrawal deadline had been extended until the end of January. In this context, more than four out of five of those surveyed felt the likelihood of a hard Border had increased since 2018. “The overwhelming reason given for this view is political leadership in Westminster, specifically the stance of PM Boris Johnson and the rhetoric of the British government on No Deal. Another reason given is the lack of political leadership from Stormont. “Regardless of views of its likelihood, a harder border is unanimously seen as a retrograde step” and was “associated with conflict in the minds of people of all generations.” For this reason, the report found, the prospect “fear and anxiety for many.” One of the report’s authors, Dr Katy Hayward, said that the “Withdrawal Agreement - objected to by all 18 newly-elected MPs from Northern Ireland - looks set to be ratified, and so Brexit appears likely to see change, to some degree, to borders all around Northern Ireland, as the new UK-EU relationship takes effect.”“In light of this,” she said, “trust-building and cooperation, north-south and British-Irish, will be more important than ever. “The models and examples of such cooperation in the Central Border Region, as presented in this report, are ones that should be valued and built upon.” CSO research Meanwhile, new demographic information on the Border region released by the Central Statistics Office has shed further light on the region. It shows that 128,106 people live within 10 km of the Border on the Republic side, with 14,205 living within 2 km - classed as a half-hour walk.However, the number of people commuting from this zone across the Border to a permanent job in Northern Ireland was relatively small at just 3,638, or 6.1 per cent of the working age population. This does not include mobile workers such as delivery drivers, or farmers who might farm both sides of the Border, or transport goods or animals across the border on a daily basis.The research shows that people in this 10 km zone are likely to be older than the rest of the state, with some 25.2 per cent of the population aged 55 or over, compared to 24 per cent of the rest of the population. The unemployment rate, at 17.5 per cent in 2016, is higher when compared to the rest of the state (12.9 per cent) for the same year.The CSO also identified that there was a higher vacancy rate among the housing stock within 10km of the border. There were 6,857 vacant dwellings, giving a rate of 12.7 per cent, which rose to 15.7 per cent within 2 kilometres of the Border. This compares to a general vacancy rate across the state of 9.4 per cent. However, the housing stock is generally newer than elsewhere in the country, with 26.9 per cent of dwellings built between 2001 and 2010, compared to a wider figure for the state of 25.4 per cent for the same period. Monaghan is the Border county with the highest proportion of its population living less than 10km from a border crossing, at 64 per cent, followed by 33 per cent in Louth and 22 per cent in Donegal. Just 6 per cent of the population of Leitrim lived within the 10km zone, however. The population across the five counties surveyed increased marginally between 2011 and 2016, by just over 1,300 people.

Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergThe new planning regulator has claimed Kerry County Council is seeking to rezone too much land around the seaside resort of Ballybunion for new housing.The Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) has advised the council to reduce the total extent of the lands it has proposed to rezone for residential use under the draft Listowel Municipal Area Plan 2019-2025.The regulator said the draft plan needed to be altered to more closely match the core strategy and settlement strategy of the Kerry County Development Plan 2015-2021.The OPR criticised the council’s proposal to alter the status of existing residential zoned lands near the centre of Ballybunion, while also proposing to rezone new lands for housing which were “significantly more distant” from the town.It pointed out that a sequential approach to the zoning of lands was required under planning guidelines issued in 2007.The regulator said the introduction of a new parcel of land for housing through an extension of the town’s southern boundary appeared to be inconsistent with the requirement for a sequential approach to zoning and would go against the objective of achieving compact growth of Ballybunion.The regulator said the draft plan was inconsistent with the Kerry County Development Plan over the council’s proposal to rezone almost 13 hectares in Ballybunion to accommodate 39 housing units.“Such a level of provision could provide for a very low density of development – in the region of four units per hectare – which would be markedly inconsistent with the approach adopted in other settlements,” the OPR said.It also warned that changes needed to be made to the draft plan to limit the potential of areas zoned for new housing in the villages of Lixnaw and Moyvane to be developed while the area’s waste water treatment plant was suffering from capacity constraints.The regulator expressed concern that no detailed flood risk maps had been prepared by the council which made it difficult to assess the appropriateness of some proposed zonings in the villages of Ballylongford and Abbeydorney.The OPR also criticised what it claimed were “deficiencies” in a flood risk assessment report prepared by the council and the “lack of any form of justification or detailed commentary for the rezoning of lands within flood zones”.The OPR said the draft plan did not explain how the development of these lands could be managed “without causing unacceptable adverse effects elsewhere”.Listowel municipal areaSeparately the regulator also recommended changes to a proposed variation by Kerry County Council of the existing plan for the Listowel municipal area.While the OPR acknowledged that the council proposals would ensure any future development in Listowel was more consolidated and compact, it said the extent of land zoned for residential development was still 15.25 hectares above that contained in the Kerry County Development Plan.The regulator also called for changes to the proposed rezoning of sites for housing in Castleisland and Islandganniv North outside Listowel because they were in an area at risk of flooding.Under legislation the council’s chief executive is obliged to provide an explanation to the OPR if it does not accept the regulator’s recommendations.On foot of that the OPR can makes recommendations to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, to direct the local authority to make changes to its development plan."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4119531.1576696102!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nadine lott remembered as a beautiful girl and beautiful in nature","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNadine Lott, a mother of one young daughter, was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital in Dublin after an alleged assault in Arklow, Co Wicklow.

Nadine, we are going to miss you so much.”Locals in Arklow said Ms Lott, the eldest of four siblings, came from a respected and popular family, adding the townspeople were struggling to come to terms with her death.She attended a local secondary school, St Mary’s College, Arklow, before studying beauty therapy at the Blackrock Further Education Institute, Dublin. Ms Lott had travelled to Australia in her 20s where she worked in the beauty industry. She was regularly involved in charity fashion shows in the south Wicklow area.Recently, she was among those who took to the catwalk during a fashion show held in the Woodenbridge Hotel and Lodge in Co Wicklow in aid of the Wicklow Hospice Foundation. On Monday, up to 1,000 members of the local community gathered in St Mary’s Park in the centre of Arklow for a vigil to show their support for Ms Lott and her family. The 30-year-old died in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, on Tuesday. She had been in critical condition since sustaining a number of injuries in an assault at her home in the early hours of Saturday.Wicklow Fianna Fáil TD Stephen Donnelly said: “My deepest sympathies go out to Nadine’s family and in particular her child. I can’t imagine the horror they are going through at the moment.”Local Fianna Fáil councillor Tommy Annesley said: “Nadine was a beautiful girl and beautiful in nature. The family are held in high esteem in Arklow and beyond.”In 2008, Ms Lott was the Festival Queen during the annual Arklow Maritime Festival. On Facebook, a representative of the local lifeboat station paid tribute: “All of us at Arklow RNLI are deeply saddened at the loss of Nadine, we were lucky enough to have gotten to know Nadine when she participated and won the Maritime Queen during our Maritime Festival a few years back. “Our deepest condolences to all of Nadine’s family and friends, RIP.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4119781.1576704254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord d%C3%A1il lacks festive cheer as martin takes final swipe of 2019","story":"As it was the last day before the Yuletide break, Aengus Ó Snodaigh broke out his Christmas tie which predictably broke into a few tinny bars of Jingle Bells to delight of all the TDs in the chamber.A mere handful of them, but they enjoyed the moment.Aengus’s Christmas tie is something of a Dáil tradition now. Ever since 2015, when he was wearing one in advance of Sinn’s Féin’s festive knees-up and it went off during Questions on Promised Legislation, he has premiered a new version on the final sitting day of the year.This time he showcased a red and white number with little trees at the bottom. After asking the Taoiseach a question in Irish, Aengus pressed a button on his tie and set off the polyphonic tune. The season was officially upon us.“Is maith liom do carbhat” said Leo. (I like your tie.)For most of the day, the atmosphere was far from seasonal in the Dáil, despite the Leas Cheann Comhairle kicking off proceedings with Christmas greetings from the Chair. The nearest they got to the spirit of the holiday was dedicating most of Leaders’ Questions to children’s issues.‘Keep us sane’The cost of childcare, along with problems insuring creches was the main topic for discussion. Not the most joyous of topics, but an important one.Pat “The Cope” Gallagher thanked all the staff in Leinster House for their support during the year and expressed his “sincere thanks” to all Members of the House, including the Taoiseach and the various leaders, for their co-operation “most of the time” .The Taoiseach thanked everyone “for the phenomenal work” they’ve done over the last 12 months.“I really hope everyone has a phenomenal Christmas and a great break. We will see everyone in the new year.”He didn’t mention a general election. No point in spoiling the moment.Micheál Martin added his good wishes to all the staff, in particular “those who feed us consistently and well, both in the various restaurants and in the bar, and keep us sane from time to time in this very exciting House”.The Fianna Fáil leader made a point of wishing the Taoiseach “a very restful and peaceful Christmas”, predicting with rare understatement that next year will be “exciting and interesting”.Mary Lou McDonald was nursing a bad cold and a sore throat, a tube of Rubex tablets on the ledge before her. Labour’s Brendan Howlin slipped a throat lozenge across the aisle to her when she had a coughing fit.The Sinn Féin leader recorded her appreciation of the hard work and diligence of the staff and hoped all the leaders can enjoy a good rest as the Dáil heads towards an election. “Can I wish them well under the mistletoe as they snuggle up together over another Christmas season,” she declared, upsetting those of a delicate disposition.The Labour leader also thought it important for TDs to have “a restful sojourn” before everyone goes mad with election fever. “As others have said, we probably face into more challenging times, perhaps early in the new year. I don’t mind winter elections – we have had winter ones and other ones, and whatever comes, comes.”Just get on with it, sighed Mattie McGrath. He complained that the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader are writing love letters over and back to each other, trying to decide the election date. “Get down and talk and let us out of our anguish. Give us a date, whatever it is and let the romance begin for a new government.”Double-jobbing DaraAround the House, which sat late to avoid going into a third day in the week before Christmas, TDs and senators scurried in and out to the car parks with boxes of supplies, stocking up for the impending campaign.The Members restaurant was packed to the rafters with politicians and guests enjoying afternoon tea. There was a leak in the roof and the rain poured into to one corner, but it didn’t spoil the fun. There was another leak in the back of the Visitors’ Bar, which was crammed with politicians, staff and journalists celebrating their temporary release.Back in the chamber, to round off the year, Micheál Martin got in his final swipe of 2019 on the matter of Dara Murphy.As political parties get a headage payment for each of their TDs, how much money did Fine Gael get from the exchequer for Dara when he was absent from his Dáil work and employed full time for two years, with his Taoiseach’s blessing, on another job in Europe?And once again, the Taoiseach went on the attack, batting for double-jobbing Dara’s honour.“The impression has been created that he was totally absent from the Dáil for two years. That, of course, is not true. In fact, he was present for more votes in this calendar year than Deputy Martin was.” (But that’s the only thing he did: vote to save his political meal ticket.)And if you take the last six months, the Fianna Fáil leader and Dara Murphy attended for the same number of votes, continued Leo, still being deliberately obtuse on an issue which has annoyed voters so much in a way the jiggery pokery over Dáil votes has not.Counting gameThe wayward button pushers weren’t working overseas while collecting every allowance and expense legitimately due to them. The only duty Murphy fulfilled in the House was to turn up and vote for Fine Gael.No wonder the Taoiseach never called him out on his dereliction of Dáil duty but dutiful collection of Dáil money.“You’re a nasty piece of work” growled Micheál.“And these are just the facts. They’re the facts, I’m sorry deputy,” said Leo, matter of factly.“I am here every Tuesday and Wednesday and you know that,” fumed Micheál.“Rather than all the name-calling, the Deputy should not be so sensitive,” the Taoiseach sweetly replied.“Be fair,” pleaded his Opposite number.“If you’re so willing to be critical of former members of my parliamentary party, you should at least be willing to account for existing members of your parliamentary party who are now under investigation,” persisted Leo, still trying to absolve himself of his part in the enterprise.By the way, he was right. Dara turned up (then skidaddled) to vote on 51 occasions as opposed to party leader Micheál Martin’s 51 occasions.Oh, and Taoiseach Varadkar trailed them all. He voted 36 times."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4118260.1576601649!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new eu ambassador among appointments approved by government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeclan Kelleher has been a pivotal figure in Irish backroom Brexit dealings in Brussels.

The ban is currently in place in Dublin and 25 large towns.Labour environment spokesman Sean Sherlock said the partial ban meant fuel sales could continue and that would make enforcement more expensive and complicated.In a second vote the Government was outnumbered by 77 to 37 on the Labour Party’s legislation to protect employees on defined benefit pensions.The Dáil vote for the Pensions (Amendment) (No 3) Bill to go to committee stage. The Bill was first introduced in 2017 by Mullingar TD Willie Penrose but private members’ legislation is subject to a lottery system and only came up for debate this month.Mr Penrose said the Bill aimed to clamp down on the practice of large companies “walking away from their pension obligations to employees” and winding down defined benefit schemes. He drafted the legislation after Independent News \u0026amp Media decided to wind down its defined benefit pension. At the time more than 100,000 workers were involved in some 700 such schemes.In the third vote a Sinn Féin motion calling on the Government to restore full pay and pension entitlements to workers in the not for profit disability service sector, was accepted by 76 to 38 votes.

Photograph:  Greg BakerAFP via Getty ImagesChina is ramping up a programme to send cadres to stay in the homes of Xinjiang’s ethnic minorities, a policy the government calls an affectionate cultural exchange aimed at fostering harmony, but one many residents see as an invasive effort to monitor and indoctrinate the Muslim community.Under the “Pair Up and Become Family” programme, more than a million public servants are assigned families in Xinjiang they must visit and stay with regularly.Cadres must stay at least five days every two months, according to a Xinjiang official, and should also visit on public holidays and during special events like weddings, funerals and birthdays “as they quickly become like family”.Officials were now being pressured to increase the frequency and length of their homestays, the government worker said.“The leaders want us to go more often to our village families and build our relationships,” the official, surnamed Liu, said. “It is important that the minorities better understand each other to help in China’s development.”Cadres were also being allocated additional families to visit, in a bid to expand the project’s reach, she said.As with other programmes in Xinjiang, it is presented as being a part of the government’s poverty alleviation efforts, where in this case inidual officials are dispatched to support and mentor their designated families.It is one of several policies targeting Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in the province, which has also seen the development of an expansive re-education camp network over the past three years where well over a million people have been interned. The government has defended the camps as de-redicalisation centres and part of their counter-terrorism initiatives.The region lies under a thick blanket of security, with ubiquitous facial-recognition CCTV cameras, fixed and random armed checkpoints, and police “convenience stations” at every corner. Security staff in bullet-proof vests check IDs and wave scans at entrances to supermarkets, department stores, hotels, chemists, parks, mosques and museums, among many other venues.TroublemakerUnder the “Become Family” programme, the surveillance extends to within the home, local Muslims claim. Families say they do not have the option to refuse the visits, as any display of resistance would place them under scrutiny as a potential troublemaker or radical, which could land them in prison or in the extrajudicial camp system.The World Uighur Congress, an exiled group based in Germany, condemned the project as in-home spying and forced assimilation.“The programme has turned Uighur homes into prisons from which there is no escape,” a spokesman said.A Uighur from Kashgar called Yimamo said that not only was the intention to spy on the families and report everything back, but the “relatives” also came to instil Han-centric, Communist-party ideologies into the Muslim, Turkic-speaking households.“They just want us to be like them. It is simple. It is just like that,” he said. “We should speak Mandarin. Give up our religion – or at least keep our faith very quiet. Love the party and the motherland.”When cadres came to visit in his area, they had a routine where people had to attend Chinese flag-raising ceremonies, study the latest speeches by China’s Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, watch Beijing-approved TV shows and study Mandarin, he said.Relations between the two ethnic groups have long been tense and the communities tend to lead largely segregated existences. Han Chinese form about 92 per cent of the country’s population, but in Xinjiang Uighurs make up the majority with about 46 per cent of the province’s 22 million people, while Han account for 40 per cent.When the Communists came to power in 1949 Xinjiang’s Han population was only six per cent, but waves of often state-sponsored migration saw the numbers rocket in recent decades.Tensions between the two communities have often resulted in an outbreak of violence, most notably 10 years ago when deadly race riots left at least 200 people dead in the provincial capital of Urumqi.‘Colonial invaders’“We always see them as like colonial invaders. They see the Uighurs as backward people who need the civilised Han to educate them and to save them. But now they are our so-called relatives and we are meant to be happy. It is stupid,” Yimamo said.Darren Byler, a Xinjiang scholar from the University of Washington, said the programme was “a deeply invasive policy that strives to transform the lives of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims through transformations and surveillance of domestic spaces”.The primary targets of the system were the family members of detainees and prisoners, he said.Some of the leaked papers instructed officials to pay particular attention to detainees and their families and to monitor the daily movements of former detainees for at least a year after they had been released.During his research into the area, Dr Byler gained access to the manuals the cadres were given to prepare for the home visits. The manuals instructed them to look out for, among other “politically incorrect” actions, signs of overtly religious behaviour. Was there a Koran in the home? Was anyone praying or fasting during Ramadan? Was a little sister’s dress too long or a little brother’s beard irregular? It all went into the notebooks and on to online databases.The visitors were also instructed to ask if their hosts had relatives living abroad, or if they had any knowledge of Arabic or Turkish. Had they attended a mosque outside of their village? All potentially suspect behaviour. They were advised to ask children the same questions separately, to check if answers matched.The visiting cadres were instructed to tell their “little brothers and sisters” that they have been monitoring all internet and cell phone communication, so they should not even think about lying.“Everything would be factored into the recommendations the big sisters and brothers would make about which of their hosts would be allowed to remain at home in their villages, with their children, and which ones should be sent away to have their defects repaired by the state,” Dr Byler said.Visit allegationsYimamo said that Uighurs were particularly enraged by two widely alleged scenarios relating to the home visits.The first is that some of the visitors bring alcohol, cigarettes and pork into the homes and push them on the Muslim guests. Afraid to seem overly zealous, the Uighurs feel obliged to partake despite it running counter to their beliefs, one allegation goes.The second is that some Han men sleep in the beds alongside women in the house, often while their husband or father is in a prison or camp. There have been allegations of sexual harassment and rape. A video clip of a man introducing his “new family” and boasting about how he was going to have sex with the 18-year-old Uighur girl went viral last week, further inciting the anger.Some locals said that officials told them if visiting men do share beds with women they should sleep one metre apart.The government denies both of these allegations.Ms Liu, the cadre, said officials pay for food and presents for their families out of their own pockets.“We care for them. We make sacrifices for them. We would never do anything improper or disrespectful,” she said. “And visiting men cannot sleep in bed with a woman. That is not allowed.”With the Chinese New Year coming up in January, gift-bearing Communist party “relatives” will be arriving into Muslim homes all over the province. The official People’s Daily has applauded the programme and sees no grounds for controversy, writing: “The ‘relatives’ get closer and closer, the friendship gets stronger and stronger . . . the true feelings of brothers and sisters, watching and helping each other are flowing everywhere.”The cables lift the lid on re-education camps run by the Chinese government where more than a million people from Uighur and other ethnic minority groups are being held "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Donald Trump becomes third US president in history to be impeached - live updatesWill Donald Trump be impeached?

If any country provides those services - openly or discreetly - they must be sanctioned,” Mr Barakat said in an interview. Israel’s foreign ministry also called on Turkey to shut down Hamas’ base in Istanbul in response to the  report. “Hamas terrorists are directing attacks against Israel from Turkey, while the Turkish leadership is turning a blind eye,” said Yuval Rotem, director general of the foreign ministry.“Israel calls on Turkey to immediately cut its support for Hamas operations out of its territory and to close Hamas\u0027 headquarters in Istanbul.”It also emerged that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president, met two alleged UK-based Hamas supporters during a trip to Britain for the Nato summit earlier this month. Mr Erdoğan addressed a rally of supporters of his Justice \u0026amp Development Party in London on December 5. At the same event he also met with Anas Altikriti and Zaher Birawi, who are both prominent Islamists in the UK with links to Hamas. Israel designated Mr Birawi as a member of a terrorist organisation in 2013 for allegedly being part of Hamas’ European office. Photographs show him sitting with Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas. Mr Birawi could not be reached for comment.Mr Erdogan (left) with Mr Altikriti (third from right) and Mr Birawi (second from right)Mr Altikriti is the head of the Cordoba Foundation, which David Cameron once described as the “political front for the Muslim Brotherhood” in Britain. Mr Altikriti has voiced support for Hamas in the past, saying it was “fighting back” against Israeli occupation.  I support the Palestinian people in their struggle for freedom from occupation, Mr Altikriti said. Any support for Hamas stems from them being the democratically elected party in 2006. I would have supported and will always support anyone who fights and wins a free and fair democratic election, regardless of faith, culture or ideology.  Neither man is on a UK list of designated terrorists. Bringing sanctions against its Nato ally Turkey would be a diplomatically fraught move for the US, which has nuclear weapons, aircraft, and service personnel based at Incirlik air base in southern Turkey. The Trump administration has so far shown little appetite for sanctioning Turkey, despite pressure in Congress to punish Mr Erdoğan for his attack on Kurdish forces in northeast Syria. Zacharia Najib, a senior Hamas operative based in Istanbul, suggested Mr Barkat as as an assassination target for a young Hamas recruit who came to Turkey. He told the recruit that he would be remembered if he killed a prominent Israeli. Mr Barkat said he had been contacted by Israel’s security services about an assassination attempt and that his personal bodyguard had been tripled until the authorities were confident the plot had been thwarted.  Mr Barkat was mayor of Jerusalem for ten years and is now a member of parliament for Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party. He is talked about as a potential future prime minister after Mr Netanyahu. Donald Trump becomes third US president in history to be impeached - live updatesWill Donald Trump be impeached?

Were you always confident that you had a fighting chance of winning?I think I was quietly confident. I’m not\u0026nbspbeing cocky, but I sort of thought if I could just continue to win, win, win – because that’s what it’s about. I wanted to win the whole\u0026nbspshow. I wanted to show him I’m down to earth, yes, but I can also run a business successfully.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspYou never once raised your voice throughout the competition. Was it a conscious effort to stay out of the fights?It’s sort of my way. Shouting isn’t my style it isn’t really in me. I do have a loud voice, but I’ve never had to shout at my team – I don’t even shout at my son I just give him a look.\u0026nbspFighting could have thrown off the whole task. That’s why I say I’m a good leader when\u0026nbspothers aren’t so good.What was that final boardroom showdown with Scarlett like?I thought we were respectful of each other as women in business. We’re\u0026nbspboth mothers and were striving for our goal. It was obviously a tough boardroom, and we had a lot to say about why Lord Sugar should invest in us, but ultimately, there was a level of respect.One thing that surprised me at the end was Scarlett getting quite personal. Did that surprise you?I think it was the way Lord Sugar\u0027s question was aimed\u0026nbspbecause I would have reacted the same. He told Scarlett her business\u0026nbspwasn’t as established as mine. Maybe he saw it as “Carina employs X amount of people and is running a turnover of X amount, whereas you’re not,” but Scarlett’s point was that we’ve been running for the same amount of time – so why would her business not be as established as mine? I wasn’t taken aback by it. I expected\u0026nbspit to be tough.Would you say you were this year’s underdog?Yeah, because I wasn’t like Thomas and all “Wahey, come and get your pillows!” We’re quite similar, and he’s ones of my best friends from the show, but whereas I would just think to myself, “Cor, I did a good job there – I made a good rollercoaster,” Tom would come back to me and say, “Carina, I’ve won this task – my rollercoaster is the bollocks.” I’d be quieter in my approach. When I thought I’d done a good job, I wouldn’t shout about it.\u0026nbspThe Apprentice finalists speak out ahead of Lord Sugar\u0027s decisionFired Apprentice candidate Lottie Lion accuses BBC of ‘abandoning’ herThe Apprentice\u0027s Lottie Lion banned from interviews after being firedYour partnership with Thomas in the final task was lovely to watch.It was nice, wasn’t it? I don’t know if people would be conscious of this\u0026nbspbut, because Lord Sugar moved us around, I was never on his team. I think that’s\u0026nbspmaybe why we got on so well – because I didn’t have to manage him. We formed a great friendship in the house. When\u0026nbsphe came back, he was bags of energy and that’s what I needed on that final challenge.If you could employ any of your fellow candidates, who would you choose?Pamela is great, isn’t she? They’re all great. My brand’s about personality – about having some sort of flair and being great with the public,\u0026nbspso Tom would be great. He’d be selling sausage rolls like there’s no tomorrow. We’d sell a lot.Now that you’re officially Lord Sugar’s business partner, I’m assuming you’ve met him away from the cameras. How’s that been?We’ve had a chat, yeah. Lord Sugar is very much how he is, you know? He’s not different off-screen he’d still tell me the same stuff and give me the same advice. I learnt\u0026nbspsome great things from him in that boardroom. He said some quotes that have stuck in my mind. We’re going to have a good adventure.What are you going to do to abate the concerns he initially might have had about your business?I’ll gain his trust massively. I’m gonna prove to him what I wanted to prove from day one: I’m here for business, I’m here to grow dough – literally – and make the business as big as we can. To have him on board\u0026nbspand believing in me is really, really great.What’s the next stage for you and Lord Sugar?I think we’re gonna meet for planning in January. We know we want to open some shops. We’ve already got one in Herne Hill, but hopefully, there’ll be a couple more Dough\u0026nbspBakehouses next year.Impossible question, this, but how would you surmise your\u0026nbspApprentice\u0026nbspexperience?Epic – that’s my word. Or fantastic – any of those words you want to use. it’s been a fantastic opportunity and I’ve loved it from the start. From the audition\u0026nbspstage to the final boardroom, everything’s been amazing.The Apprentice returns to BBC One in 2020The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her majority shareholding makes her one of Britain’s richest people and 244th wealthiest in the world, with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to Forbes.In Bet365’s annual report, Ms\u0026nbspCoates highlighted her charity work, including an £85m donation to her foundation, up from £75m the year before.“The size of the donation, and therefore the difference the foundation will be able to make to people’s lives over the coming years, are of great importance to the group,” she said.Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank focused on pay, corporate governance and responsible business, said of Ms Coates’ latest paycheck: “This looks like cynical timing, sneaked out straight after a general election campaign where excess wealth, taxes on the rich and the vast gap between those at the top and everybody else have been key issues.“It’s important that wealth and how it’s created and shared are properly debated. Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people. There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Business success should be incentivised and rewarded, but a payment a fraction of this size would still afford a lifestyle beyond the wildest dreams of most people. There’s clearly scope for those who are accumulating such sums to pay higher wages to their workers or contribute more in taxes to fund public services.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was agreed that cod quotas will be cut by 50 per cent in the North Sea, while limited quotas were agreed for cod in the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and west of Scotland – just enough to allow the landing of accidental catch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Scottish White Fish Producers\u0026nbspAssociation (SWFPA) said the cod quotas would make conditions “extremely challenging” for people in the industry.However, there were increases for other species, with quotas for haddock in the North Sea rising by 23 per cent and sole in the western Channel rising by 19 per cent.Created

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That decision appeared to be a specific attempt to draw attention to the account, and to make clear that the Twitter boss knew about it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMoments later, the Mr Dorsey used his own platform to unfollow\u0026nbspMark Zuckerberg.

It is still not clear whether it was the result of a genuine fallout or a more friendly jibe.Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s Twitter account is hardly used at all, despite having more than 400,000 followers. While he used it throughout 2009 to write about new\u0026nbsp features, the only post since was a 2012 message that linked out to a post on his official Facebook page.Mark Zuckerberg followed one new person on Twitter this yearMr Zuckerberg followed only one user of the site through the whole year – in another unexplained, unusual interaction. But that happened at the beginning of the year and is not thought to be related to any of the new events.\u0026nbspSome have speculated that the goat – and perhaps all of the events – are in reference to a strange exchange between the two billionaires at the beginning of the year.In January, Mr Dorsey claimed that Mr Zuckerberg had served one of the animals as part of a meal, during a year when he was only eating food he had killed.Mr Dorsey said that Zuckerberg is a “very, very smart businessman,” and then he went on to say: “He made goat for me for dinner. He killed the goat.”The Twitter boss then clarified that Mr Zuckerberg did not kill the goat in front of him but “killed it before” their meal.“I guess he kills it,” he said. “He kills it with a laser gun and then the knife. Then they send it to the butcher.”Mr Dorsey\u0026nbspthen corrected himself to make clear it was probably a stun gun, and went on to suggest that he did not eat the goat because it was cold.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

fisheries minister George Eustice said: “This year there has been some very challenging science for cod stocks in many parts of the northeast Atlantic and we have responded to conserve stocks.“I know that some of the quota reductions will be very difficult for some sectors of the industry, and there has been considerable debate this year about the importance of by-catch allowances to support the delivery of the discard ban.“However, we also know that\u0026nbspto protect the profitability of fisheries in the future\u0026nbspwe must fish sustainably today.”Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross said: “The UK government worked hard to secure the best possible deal for Scotland – defending the industry’s interests and the need to ensure the long-term health of fish stocks, in the face of challenging quota advice for species of great importance, such as North Sea cod.“The great news for our fishing industry and coastal communities is that, as we get Brexit done and become an independent coastal state, we will no longer be shackled by the hated Common Fisheries Policy.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when our seas face huge threats such as climate change and overfishing, the UK can lead the world by demonstrating sustainable, responsible management of our fisheries.”Chris Thorne, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “North Sea cod, like our oceans, are in crisis and so we welcome this decision to cut the quota, which we hope will give this\u0026nbspspecies space to recover.”The UK delegation was led by Mr Eustice, Mr Ewing, the Welsh government’s minister for Environment, Energy and Rural Affairs, Lesley Griffiths, and representatives from Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.Today poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education and no better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.

He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom. In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) and eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. But the programme has faced many challenges.A young girl enrolled at Remagwe school in northwestern Tanzania. The school allows her to attend without uniform, which is a rarity. Uniform, shoes and scholastic materials are expected to be funded by parents under voluntary parental contributions, which are around £10 per year. The fees are an enormous barrier to enrolment, typically parents working as farmers will collectively earn no more than £375 a year in wages that must support and sustain a family.Maryam, 12, has been enrolled in primary school since 2014. She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea. He now lives with his mother and five siblings. She supports the family by working the fields as a peasant farm hand. For him, poverty remains the greatest barrier to his education, having to walk four hours each way to school, meaning he is constantly tired at school. Challenging geographies is a major barrier to education in remote Africa.A typical classroom in rural Tanzania, often without any electricity. Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education. This bold move by the government saw a rapid increase in enrolment overnight but abolishing school fees has left schools trying to deliver education on a shoestring budget. Tanzania has the desire to make the change to education but it needs help from the international community to continue the process.There are 258 million children and young people around the world with no access to education\u0026nbsp– 59 million at the primary level alone, according to Unesco’s Institute for Statistics.Today, poverty remains one of the greatest barriers to enrolment in education programmes. No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there was a moment when I knew we’d absolutely had it.The BBC’s Nick Robinson was questioning Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell. “The Conservative message, ‘Get Brexit Done’, is very clear. What’s yours ”There was an audible gulp from Mr McDonnell, a pause, followed by patter so inconsequential that I now can’t recall it word for word. And that’s the point. If you are asking people to lend you the most precious thing they have in a democracy — their vote — you have to be able to say why.On Brexit, was Labour’s leader Jeremy Corbyn in favour of leaving the EU with his “sensible deal”, or of staying in it  He didn’t seem to know — orhe did he was keeping it from the electorate.There has not been a more abject failure of leadership by the head of any British political party since the war.Mr Corbyn, Mr McDonnell and their puppet-master, Len McCluskey, now blame not themselves but Brexit for Labour’s night of shame. But our Brexit dficulties were largely brought about by Mr Corbyn. They started with the  EU referendum.For most of that campaign, he was invisible. Only reluctantly was he persuaded to say something. When he did, it was without enthusiasm.There’s a reason for Mr Corbyn’s indecision on Brexit. The Jeremy Corbyn I knew in  years in the Commons was the man who voted against every EU treaty change — and left the strong impression he couldn’t stand the institution. But scared to fight for it, he put his party into the worst position, of having no position at all.But Brexit was just a symptom of Labour’s problems. Their cause was Mr Corbyn, what he stood for. He and those who have propped him up can body-swerve as much as they want.They have to face up to this unpalatable truth. Mr Corbyn was convincedthat the more left-wing Labour’s manesto, the more votes we would get.He didn’t disappoint. It was even more left-wing that our last effort like that — Labour’s  manesto, tagged “the longest suicide note in history”.I back far greater public spending than are the Conservatives. It’s one reason why I have been in Labour for  years.I want a fairer society, with greater equality, better opportunities and no discrimination. But you have to take people with you on this journey, and remember that it’s their money that will be paying for it.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn forgot this. They tried to promise everything at once, in a single incontinent splurge. The result was inevitable. The party fell flat on its face.Last was the terrible scourge of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn allowed to gain hold in the party until it was too late. We were indelibly stained.After Labour’s  election defeat, Neil Kinnock did the honourable thing and announced he was going.He didn’t hang around in a transparent attempt to organise the election of a successor, which is what it appears Mr Corbyn is doing — asmore of the same toxic mixture is going to work. It can’t.I love the Labour Party and all the decent things it stands for, and has done for our society. We can have a future, but onlywe break with the dismal Corbyn agenda and have a leader and organisation that can take us on that long journey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So instead he’s issued an inadequate non-apology, claiming responsibility for his “share” of the defeat.His share ! His disastrous leadership was cited as the most popular reason for not voting Labour, followed by HIS nonsensical Brexit policy, then HIS barmy plans for the economy.He and his crackpot advisers are entirely to blame for Labour’s worst electoral performance in  years.Sadly for millions of decent Labour voters, that’s not how Corbynistas see it.As Emily Thornberry has apparently made clear, in their eyes the electorate was too uneducated and bigoted to grasp the wonders of “real change”.Well, we’ve got news for the Marxist clowns.It doesn’t take a fancy degree from a top university to know an IRA-supporting, Britain-hating anti-Semite when you see one.Or to understand that a politician who promises endless freebies is clueless about economics.Corbyn and his comrades have proved that they simply don’t get this country.They must quietly slip into obscurity.THE SUN is delighted that Boris Johnson plans to decriminalise non-payment of the BBC licence fee.When we all depended on the Beeb for entertainment, forcing viewers to cough up was just about defensible.But in , when many Brits are getting their dramas from Netflix and their sport from Sky, it emphatically is not.It’s downright shocking that good citizens from poor households are getting criminal records for such a trivial non-offence. And ludicrous that courts are wasting precious time prosecuting them.The pompous and patronising BBC is losing relevance by the day.A system that locks up those who don’t pump their hard-earned cash into its bloated coffers is clearly broken.BORIS Johnson has hit the nail on the head: rotten Whitehall is ripe for reform.In almost any other line of work,you do a bad job, you’re out on your ear.But because it’s practically impossible to sack civil servants, hundreds of sub-par paper-pushers are retiring with a £,-a-year pension — an eye-popping  per cent higher than the national average.The four core values of the civil service are honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity — all noble principles that have been unceremoniously cast aside by the scaremongering Remoaners currently roaming Whitehall.The Prime Minister’s bold plan to give them the chop is an excellent sign that this Government means business. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last week, nearly eight in ten backed Boris Johnson. Just  per cent of Workington Men voted for Jeremy Corbyn, and nine in ten believed Boris would make a better Prime Minister.In backing Boris and Brexit, these voters have made the Conservative Party far more representative of working Britain. More than a third of Conservative voters are now manual or skilled workers, and more than two thirds did not go to university.Geographically, the Tories now hold three times as many seats in the North East as they did historically, as well as three quarters of constituencies in the West Midlands, up from just one in four in . So much for the party of the South, the rich and the privileged.But this new electoral coalition will demand a new kind of politics. The common ground of public opinion is now marginally to the left on the economy and right on culture.By a ratio of two to one, voters want a society focused on giving people more security rather than freedom, and investment in public services rather than income tax cuts.If Boris wants to keep Workington Man blue he must break free of the traditional conservative economic playbook of trickle-down growth and bring purpose back to towns in the North and Midlands.It is telling that the walls of Workington train station are adorned with posters of the local British Steel factory that closed in , after  years of continuous production. This is a town proud of its history.The Conservatives must help Workington identy its economic future.New infrastructure, including better roads, reliable trains and faster broadband, will help. But on their own they will not be enough. For towns such as these to flourish, they need skilled jobs, dynamic companies and lasting private-sector investment.Margaret Thatcher bent over backwards to bring Nissan to Sunderland, revitalising the region and jump-starting a lagging national industry.Boris Johnson should do the same, using science, research  development and skills spending to tempt world-class companies in emerging sectors such as renewable energy and advanced manufacturing to cluster in his party’s new heartlands.High-skill jobs need skilled workers to do them — making a retraining revolution essential.More than a third of Workington Man voters have an apprenticeship and another third are educated to GCSE level. They are highly vulnerable to automation and globalisation.The Conservative manesto included £million a year to retrain disadvantaged people, but Onward’s analysis suggests more than £billion is needed each year to retrain Britain’s .million low-skilled workers before automation hits.The Tories must also reflect on the social fabric of the places it now represents.In many regional towns, the high street is emptying, libraries, pubs and social clubs are closing and crime is a rising concern.Places such as Wrexham, Blyth Valley and Bishop Auckland, all of which voted Conservative for the first time last week, are not in the lowest ranks of deprivation but they are united by a shared loss of belonging. The Conservatives need an answer to this fraying public realm.There is a limit to how much Whitehall can ever repair a sense of community itself, so a good start would be putting people and places back in control.The success of city mayors shows the value of local accountability for local services — as Boris Johnson, a former Mayor of London, knows well.Every place should be able to take the local leadership that the capital enjoyed during his tenure.Local groups should be given powers to take over shops, post offices and pubs when they close, with funding to match. More people should be encouraged to live and work near to where they grow up, rather than moving to the city to make their way.For too long, social success has been defined by how far you move from your parents.The realignment witnessed last week was profound, but it is not yet permanent.More than a fth of voters engaged in contract voting, lending their support to a party other than the one that represents their values — and contract voting was strongest in Leave seats and former Labour strongholds that fell to the Conservatives.Workington Man lent his vote. To make him vote blue again, the Tories need to deliver. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

With little understanding of, or sympathy for, industry, business, the countryside or of course Brexiteers.”As Buerk pointed out, the BBC’s worldview is formed by the people who work for it.An estimated  per cent of them were against Brexit and there are plenty of objective studies which bear out a huge bias against Brexit.Go get ’em, BoJo.The advice is to always park where there are lots of people nearby .And in a well lit area. With the back of the car as close to a fence or kerb as possible.Anyway,someone sidles up to you in the pub and offers you a catalytic converter for a ton, here’s what to do.Kick him in the penkies and shove the converter as far up his rectum as is humanly possible.He’ll be passing incredibly clean wind, regardless of how many sprouts he eats.IS it possible to be more thick than Lauren Goodger  If so, how The Towie “star” got caught in a sting by the BBC. She was filmed endorsing a supposed health drink called Cyanora.She was told the product contained hydrogen cyanide, one of the most lethal substances known to mankind. But not known to Lauren, apparently.She was perfectly happy to give it her blessing. She admitted she’d never tried it . But then she also admitted she had never tried another product she had endorsed.Listen. Never believe TV personalities, actors, singers, etc.Don’t believe them when they tell you what way to vote. Don’t believe them when they’re trying to flog you something. For the most part they’re just greedy and thick as a plate of mince.OH what a pleasure it was to walk around a nice liberal, middle-class area of London last weekend singing: “Ohhhhhh Jeremy Corbyn!”The looks of hatred! I suppose it’s wrong to take pleasure in other people’s misery. But sometimes I can’t help it. Years of being told we’re all bigoted, racist and uneducated, I suppose.My we said she was more thrilled by the election result than she was by the birth of our daughter, which I think is pushing it a bit.Anyway, Boris Johnson has proven that he is a very canny politician indeed.He won the Mayor of London elections twice – by wooing the most right-on liberal electorate in Europe. And then he appealed to exactly the opposite tranche of voters to win the election last week.Huge credit, mind, to his adviser Dominic Cummings. A very sharp bloke – and from the North East. He never had any doubts about the result.What, being called a “smarty-pants”  If you end up troubled by having been called something like that  years previously, I would argue that your problems lie a lot deeper and were not actually caused by the insult.Shouldn’t we be trying to instil a degree of resilience among you people  Rather than feeling “triggered” at every single thing that’s said to them TURKEY is rapidly becoming the pariah state of the world.Its horrible government allows the genocidal terrorists Hamas to plot attacks on Israel from within Istanbul.The Turkish leader, Recep Erdogan, recently rolled out the red carpet for the Islamist maniacs of Hamas.A few years ago we were anxious to welcome Turkey into the European Union.Now we should impose sanctions on the country.Friends of anti-Jewish terrorists are no friends of ours.CHRISTMAS is the time of year when you open a bottle from the fridge expecting a nice glass of wine and it’s actually the we’s non-alcoholic “Christmas Mulled Berry Punch”, which tastes like a Moroccan’s gusset.The time of year when the rellies turn up, like not very wise men, each bearing their present of a bloody panettone which nobody anywhere will eat.When the awful Lonely This Christmas, by Mud, gets dragged out of its tomb – I’ve hated that song for  years.When good, God-fearing Christian people kick the s**t out of each other in an attempt to secure the last PlayStation, or something, in the sales. Ah well. There are compensations, I suppose.Half a day off work spent with a bottle of Jack Daniel’s and some Mon Cheri liqueurs in my tightly locked office watching a rerun of Millwall beating Arsenal at Highbury in . Can’t top that.It’s been a helluva year – hope you all have a lovely Christmas Day and get all that you wished for. x Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially now we know the election result flattered Corbyn.The boundaries are still skewed in Labour’s favour — and the Brexit Party seems to have gted Corbyn  northern seats by ­preventing certain Tory victories.Labour’s problems run far deeper than they have realised.

RUIs are what the Law Society’s head of justice has described as a “major scandal” waiting to erupt.I know Home Secretary Priti Patel will have a lot on her plate as Parliament begins, but this ought to be one of her top priorities.The shocking overuse of RUI came to light on Wednesday, after -year-old thug Ewan Ireland was jailed for le for the murder of solicitor Peter Duncan in a Newcastle shopping centre in August.Peter’s misfortune was to have brushed past Ireland in the doorway of a shop, an act which Ireland took as a slight.He took hold of the screwdriver he had stolen minutes earlier and drove it into Mr Duncan’s heart.It is a tale of mindless, casual violence which has become all too common in modern Britain as the jumped-up egos of young men rage against anyone who gets in their way.But what makes it all the more disturbing is that Ireland’s tendency for extreme violence was well known to police and the courts, yet still he was allowed to walk the streets.While other boys of his age are busy studying for A-levels, Ireland had already amassed a formidable range of criminal qualications.He had  convictions for  dferent offences. He was on conditional discharge for an offence of battery and on bail for a charge of affray for threatening to slash another boy’s Achilles’ tendon.Yet in spite of all this, he had been released under investigation for a robbery.He is not the only violent criminal to have been sent on his way by police. In September last year Alan Martin, of Sunderland, was released by police after his estranged we accused him of raping her.Not only did officers release him, they also ed to him the keys to his we’s house. He promptly ed to the address, attacked her with a hammer and strangled her before taking his own le, too.Astonishingly, Northumbria Police were later cleared by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. No one seems to want to take responsibility. No doubt it will be the same next time, too.Since April , , violent criminals have been released under investigation, Home Office figures reveal.Unlike police bail, no restrictions have been placed on these people. They are not banned from visiting particular places, they have not had to raise a deposit, hand over their passport or report to police at regular intervals. Nor, unlike police bail, is there any time limit on RUI, so police are under no pressure to bring charges quickly.The misuse of RUI is a hangover from Amber Rudd’s time as Home Secretary. It was her Policing and Crime Act  which stopped police putting people on bail for periods of more than  days. True, something needed to be done. The case of former Radio  DJ Paul Gambaccini had inspired the rule change.He had been held on bail for a whole year as police investigated accusations of historic sex offences which turned out to be without foundation.Unable to put criminals on bail for more than  days, police forces took to releasing them under investigation instead.That might be perfectly reasonable in the case of relatively minor crimes which take a long time to investigate, but it is hardly an appropriate way to treat suspected murderers and rapists, especially those with a long history of violent offences.At the very least, people suspected of violent offences — and for which good evidence exists that those offences really did take place — need to be monitored.As for people who have been released on licence while serving sentences for previous convictions, there should be no argument at all — they should be taken back to prison without hesitation.Ministers like to talk tough on crime, especially around election time, but behind the scenes they get caught in the stranglehold of the liberal establishment.Punishments get weakened, prisoners get released early.Disgracefully, former Home Secretary Jack Straw described the sentencing system as the “benign deception of the public”, who, unaware of the soft reality, assume that criminals are being properly punished.But there is nothing benign about serial offenders being freed to rape and murder when police and the courts know full well their records.During the election campaign, Boris Johnson finally called an end to the deception.Braving an onslaught from the nation’s liberal consciences, he announced that prisoners will no longer be eligible for automatic early release — something which allowed the London Bridge killer Usman Khan to embark on his murderous spree.But the Johnson Government should not end there.It needs to stop the police releasing violent offenders back into the community without any restrictions on their movements nor any requirement ever to report to a police station.Liberals like to say that we can’t solve crime just by jailing people. On the contrary, had Ewan Ireland been kept out of circulation after his first offence it would alone have meant  fewer crimes in Newcastle over the past four years.It is hard enough to catch criminals.But to release those we do catch, giving them the freedom to embark on long crime sprees, is plain madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can do this by filling in a form yourself when youto work. This is called self-certication.Plenty of companies have their own self-certication form, butnot you can download a template created by HM Revenue and Customs here.Once you have been ill for more than seven consecutive daysyou will need to provide your employer with a sick note.According to the NHS website, it depends why youre off work sick and whether your GP says that they have to see you in person - its very much  a case-by-case situation.Call up your surgery and your GP practice will tell you whether you need to physically go in to be signed off.Your fit note will be issued on the day that your GP examines or speaks to you.If you need a fit note make an appointment with your local GP.They will assess you and decideyou are in a healthy condition for work or not.If they deem that you are not fit for work they will write a note to that effect that you can present to your employer.They may think that you may be fit for work taking into account the following advice, under which circumstances they would layout circumstances or changes to your usual working routine that would allow you to perform your job - or some iation of it.If your employer is unable to accommodate these conditions, the note is considered to say unfit for work.Employees must give their employer a doctors notethey have been ill for more than seven days in a row and taken sick leave.This includes non-working days, including weekends and bank holidays.Fit notes are freethe employee has been ill for more than  days when they ask for one. The doctor might charge a feethey ask for the fit note earlier.The fit note will say the employee is either ‘not fit for work’ or ‘may be fit for work’.If it says the employee ‘may be fit for work’, employers should discuss any changes that might help the employeeto work . The employee must be treated as ‘not fit for work’there’s no agreement on these changes.You can get £.

Detailed statistics from the Department for Work and Pensionsshow the reality of the , former Disability Living Allowance claimants whoaposve lost out since . This week the Mirror reported how % of former DLA claimants lost money after moving to new benefit Personal Independence Payment . In total, of the .million DLA claimants reassessed for PIP by October , ,had their benefit cut, ,had it stopped after an assessment, ,had it stopped before assessment and ,withdrew their claim. In contrast , claimantssaw their award rise and ,had it unchanged. But the DWPaposs detailed figures give a fascinating insight that show the real people behind the numbers. The worst-hit were people with psychosis, , of whom either failed a PIP assessment entirely or had their money cut since . By comparison, , saw their payment rise.Some , arthritis sufferers had their PIP cut or stopped when they moved from DLA - while , saw it go up.Scroll down for the full list of disabilities and how they are hit.   Epilepsy sufferers were also badly hit, with , losing some or all of their benefits compared to , who received more. And , people with MS, , with AIDS and  with cystic fibrosis saw their money either cut or stopped. Since , even  double amputees have had their money cut when moving from DLA to PIP - while  saw their award go up. Some groups were better off on average. , blind people saw payments cut or stopped but , saw them rise. Likewise , people with learning dficulties lost out but , were better off. These figures only relate to claimants who were already on the old DLA system when they claimed PIP. And they do not include people who lost their benefits before an assessment, failed to attend an appointment, or withdrew their claim.  MS sufferer Rachel Taylor, from Halax, West Yorkshire, told the Mirror she lost her adapted Motability car for around a year after her benefits were cut moving from DLA to PIP. The -year-old mother-of-one and librarian uses a zimmer frame, walking stick and mobility scooter to get around. But despite claiming DLA since  she said she was awarded the lower rates of PIP after a  assessment. She waited around a year until, weeks before her appeal tribunal, she said she received a phone call saying sheaposd get the higher rate after all. She told the Mirror: I ended up taking several thousand pounds out of my pension pot.  The stress has been immeasurable. I take pride in what I’m able still able to do. But I now believe I was penalised for trying to keep my independence.” Ms Taylor still works part-time but said I couldnapost be more disabled.

Steven Bonnar took the oath which is required by all MPs before they can took up his post - in it you swear allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors. But for many MPs - from Scottish Nationalists to Republicans - the idea of taking an oath to the monarchy is politically...dficult. Mr Bonnar appeared to cross his fingers as he took the oath and then made he was taking so he could sevrve the people of Coatbridge Chryston  Bellshill. In  Richard Burgon used a very similar form of words to register his protest. A tweet from Mr Bonnar didnapost mention his protest - and used a picture where you couldnapost see his fingers. His tweet read: Thataposs us all official now. I have been sworn in as the MP for Coatbridge Chryston and Bellshill.

We lost what felt like an A-Z of English and Welsh ‘heartland’ seats – Ashfield, Bassetlaw and Bolsover all the way through to Workington, Wrexham and Ynys Môn. Many of these  seats had voted Labour for over half a century. I found this hideously painful to watch, but my constituents who are suffering under the Tories from low wages, an explosion in child poverty, and the disastrous failure of Universal Credit will have felt much, much worse. So how did this nightmare happen  Firstly, our leadership came across as weak and incompetent, failing to tackle anti-Semitism, failing to communicate its messages, and failing to present a credible manesto. In  Labour had an intelligent, fully-costed manesto, but in  we offered a Christmas wish-list. Perhaps the biggest mistake, politically, was on Brexit. Slowly Labour has become a puppet of the People’s Vote campaign. If we’d accepted Theresa May’s final cross-party offer in the Spring we could have been looking a soft Brexit compromise and a post-Brexit Labour government. Instead we have a hard Brexit and at least five more years of the Tories. A public apology from Labour to Leave voters for failing to properly respect the referendum result, and to Remainers for failing to secure the best possible Brexit, would help build bridges. Moving forward, there are some causes for optimism. Many voters will have ‘lent’ their votes to the Tories to ‘get Brexit done’ and because of concerns about Jeremy Corbyn.  Now Labour must focus relentlessly on winning those voters back so we can rebuild the ‘Red Wall’. This means showing voters we can keep our nation safe and our public finances healthy. It means helping more families and communities to thrive in the modern world, recognising that for too long politicians have let global economic forces rip up high streets and close down workplaces all across Britain’s industrial towns, without giving people the tools to succeed. That must now change. We must also ditch Corbyn’s hard-left world view that allows the conspiracy theories that drive anti-Semitism, and that have no truck with ordinary, hard-working people. We must also start bringing people together, uniting and empowering families and communities. This means devolving power out of Westminster across England in particular, but it also means understanding thatwe want to build a successful, erse, tolerant society we need to focus far more on what we have in common than on our dferences. Labour needs to stop playing politics with identity and start bringing people together. That’s the recipe the next Labour leader will need to rebuild Britain. That’s the criteria they must be judged upon.

Steven Patterson, , saw his beloved Congo grey parrot Marlon Dingle die in his arms after suffocating from smoke bellowing out of his Hotpoint tumble dryer, he said. The takeaway owner had popped out to buy dinner when he received a call from emergency services saying his flat had caught fire. Emergency services raced to the scene to tackle the blaze with firefighters and even went to s to create a make-sht miniature plastic mask in a bid to save Marlon. But despite their efforts, ten-year-old Marlon passed away and was buried in the garden later that day. Whirlpool - which owns Hotpoint - deny the fire was caused by the tumble dryer - which wasnapost subject to the mass recall of products in February . The manufacturer pulled , Hotpoint and Indesit models from shelves yesterday over fears they could overheat and catch fire. Last month an investigation ruled Steven would not be entitled for compensation as the tumble dryer was not installed according to the manufactureraposs instructions. Now a year after the blaze, Stephen says he is still without answers as to how the fire started and has vowed to avenge Marlonaposs death to prevent him from dying in vain. Steven, from Fawdon, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, said: My parrot Marlon Dingle is dead and they donapost care one bit.  Weaposve lost a member of a family. He was the baby of the family. Him and my daughter grew up together. He used to mimic my daughter and mam, weaposve got so many happy memories involving him. I rescued him from someone who was keeping him in a shed in their garden about ten years ago. I turned round and told him he shouldnapost be keeping him like that. I said Iaposd give him £ to take him back and give him a good home. I hate people who take the p*** with animals. It took him a year to come out of his cage. But when we grew that bond it was unbreakable. I canapost believe heaposs gone and thereaposs not an ounce of sympathy.Steven bought the tumble dryer in September  which he went to use weekly, and claims to have emptied out the filter after each use. But two years later when Steven had popped out to buy dinner when he received a call saying his kitchen was on fire. Steven said: My instinct was to rush over his cage and take him out of the house. Heaposd always used to squawk and be loud but this wasnapost squawking this was squealing. He was choking so bad. The firefighters made a makesht plastic mask for him. He was just so terried and covered in soot.It was just terrible to watch. I managed to grab a tea towel to wrap him up in but within ten minutes he died in my arms. I took a photo so I could show people what had happened but I couldnapost bare to take anymore. I know I sound daft. Iaposm covered in tattoos and Iaposm getting all poncy over a bird but he was my little bird. He used to rest up on my shoulder and weaposd watch TV together. Everyone in the area knew him. It was like having a dog but he could speak. He may not have understood what I said but he was part of the family.Last month the insurance company ruled they cannot say with any certainty that the appliance was installed according to the manufactureraposs instructions. Steven said: I had expensive pots and pans, the key to my vintage motorbike, tonnes of designer clothes which I had just washed. Theyaposve been doing that forensic report for a year and for them to turn round and say it wasnapost installed properly is a joke. Itaposs like getting someone in to install your kettle or a microwave. Are you telling me these need to be installed by a Whirlpool engineer too  Itaposs ridiculous. The thing is the tumble dryer was switched off. There wasnapost even any power going into it and it still caught alight.  Everything in there was burned to a crisp. The TV that was eight or nine feet away from the tumble dryer was completely melted.

Donna Gilby left her flat just after am yesterday morning when she slipped and fractured her foot.The -year-old had been on her way to a doctoraposs appointment, reports Wales Online. And now the family of the mum-of-one want the world to see the photograph of her lying outside - face down and unable to move - as her friends and neighbours rallied round, covering her with blankets and duvets to keep her warm as the temperature dropped. They also called  for Donna, who suffered from an irregular heart beat and had two mini-strokes, and alerted her family who live nearby. Have your loved ones suffered an agonising wait for an ambulance  Email webnews@mirror We then called the ambulance service and told them Donna was slipping in and out of consciousness - that must have been somewhere between eight and .am, says her father Gareth Gilby, a -year-old former factory worker. The call handler told us they were dealing with aposa heavy influx of callsapos and that theyaposd be with her aposas soon as possibleapos. When there was still no sign an hour later we called again -  this time we were told they were aposdoing their bestapos but that they aposdidnapost know when they would get to herapos. He adds that the ambulance finally arrived shortly before pm and rushed his daughter to Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. But, in the early hours of this morning, Donna suffered a cardiac arrest and passed away. We still canapost really believe it, adds Gareth.  She was as good as gold and always put others before herself - sheaposd do anything for anyone. As a result she put her own problems second, like the fact that sheaposd struggled with her weight and ill-health for years. Donnaaposs nephew James Perkins, a -year-old construction worker, says he had just been celebrating his own -month-old son coming out of intensive care at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant when he got the devastating news. My boy had been touch-and-go with bronchiolitis, so Iaposd been showing my mates in work photos of him looking well again when I took the call about my auntie. I just canapost believe it - itaposs cruel. Her poor little girl. Every Christmas from now on is going to be a reminder of her losing her mum. Thankfully this is a strong family unit and sheaposll be well looked after, but Iaposm so sad for her.  In a statement from the Welsh Ambulance Service, Chief Executive Jason Killens said: “We were deeply saddened to hear about the death of Ms Gilby and would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her family. We are sorry that our response took longer than we would have liked on this occasion. Our ambulance service exists to care for people, and our staff share the same upset and frustrations as patients and their loved ones at times like this. Lengthy waits for an ambulance are a sign of pressures across the whole unscheduled care system, not just in Wales but across the UK. An increase in high-priority ‘Red’ calls and signicant hospital handover delays in particular are impacting on our ability to respond to  calls as quickly as we would like.

These toys should have been packed away in boxes, or strewn across the floor for little hands to play with. But instead they form a heartbreaking shrine to the two children who should have received them – but who died in a house fire just days before Christmas. Jade, , and Alex, , perished in the blaze on December , , but their little brother Nathan, then , miraculously escaped along with his mum and dad. Speaking about the tragedy for the first time, mum Mandy, , said: “One of the only things that survived the fire were the kidsapos Christmas presents. They were hidden away in a cupboard. Weaposve kept them all this time. “My one wish every year is to be able to give Jade and Alex those presents. But I know I never can.” Remembering that night, their dad Andrew, , said: “Every Christmas we all lit up our houses to raise money for charity. “Our street became known as Christmas Street. People used to travel  miles to see it. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror  “That night, my we and I were sitting downstairs watching TV. At about .pm we heard this massive bang and the lights went out. “Smoke was coming from the dining room. “I shouted aposfireapos and ran to the kids. “Smoke was everywhere and it was inky dark. The smoke alarm was ringing. “Jade was standing at the top of the stairs. I grabbed her hand and turned towards the boysapos room.  “The boys were sat in bed crying. We could barely breathe. I opened the bedroom window and got out on the window sill shouting for help. “I was still holding my daughteraposs hand but her hand left my grip. “I turned to look for her when a neighbour, who had just climbed a ladder to get us, pulled me out of the room. “We both fell about ft and landed on the car below.  “I tried to stand up but I collapsed. “The house was in flames and the windows were popping. “Mandy was screaming aposI want my babies!apos while neighbours held her back from the burning house. “I was having dficulty breathing and the back of my throat was burning. Everything was going very fast but moving in slow motion at the same time. “It felt like I was trapped underwater. There was a man shouting in my face but I couldnapost hear him.  “One man ran out of the house with his coat on fire. He was holding our youngest boy Nathan. “Our daughteraposs body was later found in the bathroom. She must have been disorientated by the smoke and turned right when she left the boys room instead of heading for the stairs. Our oldest lad stayed curled up in bed tucked under his duvet. “Only Nathan turned down the stairs.”  Andrew was taken to Barnsley hospital where he was later told that both Jade and Alex had died. “I kept thinking I should have held Jade tighter,” Andrew said. “Itaposs a fatheraposs responsibility to protect his children and I wish I could have protected them that night. “I watched every news broadcast in the hospital that week, seeing what happened to the kids. The fire was all over the news at the time. I canapost explain why I needed to watch it but I did. I had to watch all these people talking about my kids.  “Nathan was in intensive care in Leedaposs Hospitalaposs burns and fire unit for one week in an induced coma and on le support. “My we had been treated for smoke inhalation but was discharged quickly so she could be with Nathan. Mandy said: “I still had visions of losing him too until he came out of the coma. “I used to sit by his bed holding his hand and praying that he would be OK. I kept saying aposmummy loves you.apos”  Andrew said: “The fire was a Monday and the following Sunday they took Nathan off le support. “We all stood around his bed waiting for him to wake up. His first words were aposmummaapos. “He had blisters and scars on his hands where he had been burned. “The trauma and stress caused his mind to blank out. He canapost remember anything before the fire. “He knew he had a brother and a sister but he couldnapost remember them. “I think it protected him.  “When he came home and saw photos of them he never asked aposwhoaposs that apos “He knew he had a brother and sister but he just didnapost know who they were. “Theyaposre buried together. Alex was in a camouflage coffin because he loved Action Man and Jade was in a Barbie pink coffin. Everyone cried as their coffins were lowered into the ground.” A post mortem found that Jade and Alex both died from smoke inhalation, but the pathologist said the youngsters had received such extensive burn injuries that they would have been unlikely to survive.  An inquest into the childrensapos deaths heard how although it was clear that the fire started near a fibre optic Christmas tree, it was impossible to say what exactly had sparked the blaze. The hearing in Sheffield was told there was no evidence that the electrical system at the house was overloaded or dangerous. The Yorkshire Post reported that Coroner Chris Dorries recorded a verdict of accidental death on Alex and Jade. He said the family had suffered a tragedy in its most terrible form adding: “What we know is that the blaze started in the corner of the dining room and we know there was electrical equipment in that corner.”Some of the electrical items, including a fibre optic tree, had melted in the blaze and could not be examined. But, other items recovered were proven not to have been the cause of the fire. “I think from what has been said that the cause of the fire was electrical in nature, but whether it was an item or was related to the wiring I do not know.”    Walking into their fire-ravaged home after their deaths was dficult for Andrew and Mandy, but some things miraculously survived the inferno. “Our house was gutted,” Andrew said. “You could see the sky where the roof used to be. “But we got a few things. “We still have their Christmas presents. Theyaposre one of the few things that survived the fire. “And a council worker found Jadeaposs ring in the ashes. My we wears it around her neck now  . She never takes it off. “Everything  down to the teaspoons had to be replaced. “People from all over the world sent us letters and donations. “David Beckham donated a shirt for a fundraising auction, a world-champion boxer donated gloves and Frankie Dettori donated jodhpurs. “My we and I didnapost go to the inquest, our family went and told us what happened at it. “They said it was probably an electrical fault somewhere in the wiring. But there wasnapost enough of the house left to conclusively say how the fire started. “Originally we thought it was the lights on a Christmas tree. But they ran tests which showed that nothing had overloaded, they donapost think it was the Christmas lights that sparked it but some internal wiring. “They donapost have a reason for the fire and the coroneraposs verdict was accidental death.”  Just days after the first year anniversary of Jade and Alexaposs deaths, Mandy found out she was pregnant. Mandy said: “I found out I was pregnant on Christmas Day the following year. I had a big smile on my face when I told Andrew that the test was positive. “But I was happy and sad at the same time. I was trying to be happy for Nathan at Christmas, I was happy to be pregnant but I was thinking about Alex and Jade all the time too.” “We called her Ellie-Ja,” said Andrew. “We agreed that Ja, for Jade and Alex, would be part of her name. “She looks just like her sister. “She couldnapost tell who was who when she looked at pictures of them both when she was younger. “And she speaks exactly like her brother did.  “She never met them but from the time she could talk you could hear her talking to them at night. “She never remembered it but we could hear her. So we know theyaposre around. “Ellie is  now. When things happen to her and people say aposyou must have aAngel,apos she says, aposactually I have two.apos “Sheaposs been hit by cars twice but survived.  “She feels very close to them. Every time she walks past the graveyard she leaves some coins on their headstone.” The fire broke out at their former home on John Street, Thurnscoe, South Yorkshire, but the family has since moved to a bungalow in Goldthorpe which is easier for his we Mandy, who has mobility issues, to manage. Both parents have tattoos in memory of their children – their skin etched indelibly with their names and pictures of hearts. Surviving brother Nathan, , has a clock with its hands pointing to the exact time the fire struck taking his siblingsapos lives.  The familyaposs Christmas traditions of decorating the tree and leaving out mince pies for Santa are no more. Instead, the family will visit Alex and Jadeaposs grave on December . “I used to love Christmas,” said Mandy. “All the lights and everything. But as the kids have grown up we celebrate Christmas less and less. Last year we didnapost have a tree. Mandy and Andrew say le without Jade and Alex has been very, very dficult. Both parents have been plagued by depression and PTSD but they have managed to keep going thanks to Nathan and Ellie-Ja.

The totaposs death is believed to be related to a bronchial infection. Her devastated parents, Mike and Jodie, who have three other children Taylah, Jack and Imogen, had noticed Eliza had a high temperature on December , and treated her with prescription medication. The same week their older children, aged four and six years old, had been off school sick, and they believed Eliza had caught the same bug. Elizaaposs temperature was kept under control with medication, and Mike and Jodie believed she was recovering as she was eating and drinking. Her parents are now desperate to raise awareness of the killer infection. Mike said: Just over  hours ago our daughter Eliza died from what looks to have been septicemia.Initially we thought it had been brought on by meningitis - turns out that itaposs just been a bronchial infection.She was just two years and nine months old.  We like to think we are educated, experienced parents. We had four children. Weaposre both trained in paediatric first aid, we know the signs. Our kids have had ious dferent health issues, amongst them Eliza had hearing loss and she needed glasses - she loved wearing them. A week ago our four-year-old was sent home from school, feeling tired and jaded.  She slept for the rest of the day and was otherwise fine. The following day our six-year-old vomited at school and was obviously sent home. He took an hour to recover and was fine from that point on. On Thursday lunchtime, Eliza was running a temperature at nursery, so we brought her home. She was happy and bright enough, and the following day we planned to take her back to the nursery with prescription medicine to keep her temperature under control.  In the end we decided to take her with us where we had a travel cot made up for her. She was happy enough, slept on and off for the day, and we were able to keep her temperature under control through the medicine. At this stage we just thought she had the same bug that the other two kids had had earlier on in the week. On Saturday she still had a bit of a temperature, but she was asking for food and drinks and playing with Lego at  oaposclock. At one oaposclock she started to show a bit of purpura, a discolouration of the skin caused by inflammation.  Hours before her death Eliza had been playing with Lego at the family home in Rhu, Argyll and Bute in Scotland. When her health deteriorated her parents rushed her to the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, but tragically Eliza could not be saved. She was rushed to hospital but had died before we could get there, Mike said. Hospital staff did all they could but there was nothing that they could do.  Our family, friends and community have been fantastic in support, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. In an emotional video plea, tearful Mike said: But we have one more favour to ask you, and to anyone watching this video - spread this message far and wide. If by telling our story we can ensure just one personaposs le is saved, one family is saved from this pain, Elizaaposs death will not be without reason. Generous donors have raised more than £, for the grieving family, who run a nursery in Helensburgh, Argyll and Bute.  A spokesman for Police Scotland said: Around .pm on Saturday, December , a two-year-old girl took unwell within her home in Rhu, Helensburgh. She was taken to the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria, where she died a short time later. Her family is aware and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.

Neyleen Ashley, , from Miami, Florida, met her ex-boyfriend, who has not been named, through mutual friends back in . She thought he was immature at first and was’t suitable for her long-term, but her affection for him grew and things soon became serious. Neyleen saw numerous red flags during their long-distance relationship, but would sweep it under the rug as she was completely smitten by him. Neyleen said: “My feelings about him were that he was very immature and not ready to settle down, but then as things progressed the feelings grew and eventually we became very serious about each other, but I always saw red flags, being that we were in a long distance relationship things were easy for him to keep under wraps. “He would never post me on social media, and he was very secretive about his phone. I always posted him on my stories and made it known I was in a relationship, and my phone was always at his disposal.” Neyleen helped pay for all her partneraposs expenses – but was none the wiser as he saw other women behind her back. Neyleen had a hunch something was wrong and admitted their relationship was always “rocky”, but she said her caring nature often took over and she became blind-sided to his behaviour. She added: “Our relationship was always rocky. He never made me feel secure as a woman, or that I was worth anything. “I figured dating a normal man from a small town that he would be in ‘awe’ of me, but he treated me like I was anyone . “At the time he was trying to get his le in order so I was the sole money maker towards the end of the relationship, and he used my money and his free time to see prostitutes, go to massage parlours or even have another girlfriend in another city.  “He left me to see these prostitutes on my mother’s birthday knowing how stressed I was, and wouldn’t even talk to me on my birthday or post anything because he didn’t want his other girlfriend to see.” One day, Neyleen’s boyfriend noticed her boyfriend’s Apple Watch buzzing repeatedly with notications while he was outside their home. Out of curiosity, she decided to check it up and was mortied to find pictures of a girl in lingerie along with dozens of messages from prostitutes. She soon found out he had been corresponding with these girls for months and was meeting prostitutes every week since they had started dating. She said: “I found out he cheated because I had a hunch for a long long time, I am very intuitive and I knew something was off. Although I wanted to trust him, I felt like I was getting taken advantage of. Not only financially, but personally because I’m such a loving and caring person.  “One day I was home and he was washing his truck outside, I saw his Apple Watch going off buzzing and buzzing and buzzing. I got curious because I saw a small square that looked like a picture of a girls butt in underwear and I opened it. “In utter shock and disbelief, I find numerous attempts to meet prostitutes at massage parlours, hotels and their home. “One girl even said ‘I can’t my parents are home’. “I saw numerous girls sending him pictures on his birthday, and texts from his ex as well. “I then decided to take the Apple Watch with me and I left the house and parked by a spot with open land close to my house because I could not breathe. “I kept investigating and I found messages and calls from one specic number, I saw messages saying ‘I wanted to fuck you’ the same day he left me and told me he loved me. “I saw messages saying how much he missed her and liked her, all while he never acknowledged my presence and often left me with arms wide open when trying to hug him goodbye or hello.  “I found out that he had a whole other girlfriend for several months, side chicks, talking to his ex and meeting with multiple prostitutes weekly. Neyleen decided to confront her boyfriend at the time, but downplayed her concerns. After their break up, Neyleen claimed her ex begged her toand even contacted her friends and family to convince her he had “changed”. However, Neyleen said she has no plans of going back to him and now hopes move forward with her le on a positive note. She said: “I am feeling empowered and actually very strong. “Unfortunately, I can’t say I’ve never had a good relationship or partner because I love too hard and give too easily and conform. So, I allow myself to be a doormat, because I didn’t know my worth back then. “But now I know how indestructible I truly am, and how strong and beautul I have become.

While it might seem like a wonderful le at the time, the morning after can be a dferent story, thanks to the biggest Grinch of all – a holiday hangover. And with shopping to do, family to see and work to wrap up before the end of the year, thereaposs no time for staying in bed. So, what hangover cures really work  From a full fry-up to hair of the dog, we take a look at what you need to do to make yourself feel better and have a very merry little Christmas... Myth: Have a fry up After a heavy night, itaposs normal to wake up craving carbs – and a greasy fry-up certainly ticks all the boxes. But health experts warn that itaposs best not to bring home the bacon. For, drinking causes you to lose nutrients through urine – and a heavy breakfast could trigger indigestion. As a result, a more nutritious breakfast can help you battle a hangover more quickly. Fruit, such as bananas, can help restore potassium and blood sugar levels. Or,that seems a little too zesty, then honey on toast is also easy for the stomach to digest. Myth: Hit the gym Some people may swear by a sweaty gym class to perk them up after drinking too much – but this can actually do more harm than good, as your body is already dehydrated. Instead, itaposs better to go for a brisk walk in the fresh air to release endorphins and improve circulation, in a gentler way.  Myth: Take a painkiller before bed Think that taking a painkiller before bed will stop any impeding hangover  You couldnapost be more wrong. Most over-the-counter painkillers take  minutes to start working and the results only last a few hours. So, by the time you wake up itaposs likely that you wonapost be able to feel any effects. On top of this, painkillers can mix with the gastric acids created by alcohol in your stomach – which could cause damage to your stomach lining. So,you really need to pop some pills, itaposs best to wait and assess your situation in the morning. Myth: Coffee cures all When youaposre feeling sluggish it can be tempting to reach for the coffee for a bit of a buzz. But although coffee isnapost quite as dehydrating as alcohol, it is still a diuretic and could hinder your recovery. If you really need a caffeine hit, try to stick to just one cup before switching back to water.  Myth: Gorge on late night takeaways Itaposs bad news for those who like to end the night with a burger and chips. For, while it may seem like a good way to soak up excess alcohol, fast food can actually irritate your stomach and cause you to put on weight. Instead, itaposs better to eat a big meal before heading out – to line your stomach before drinking alcohol. Myth: Keep going Continuing to drink may delay your hangover but it certainly wonapost stop it. So, itaposs best to have some water with your breakfast rather than an early-morning beer.

Carley Coca from Florida took her seven-year-old Samoyed, named Nanuk, to her local groomer for a trim but there was a mix-up in communication along the way. When the -year-old arrived to pick up her fluffy white dog she was surprised to discover he was completely bald - and would have to wear sun cream until his fur grew back. Nanuk ended up looking more like a British Bull Terrier than a Samoyed - but luckily Carley saw the funny side of the situation. The occupational therapy doctorate student recalls walking straight past her pooch at the groomers when going to collect him. She said: When I went to pick up Nanuk from the groomers, I literally said out loud, aposThataposs not my dogapos. The groomer assured me it was Nanuk and I even had to call him to check, but he looked like a complete dferent breed. Carley added: Nanuk seemed to love the haircut - he acted so proud. But heaposd never looked like that before, I was so shocked. Even as a puppy, heaposd always been so fluffy. I couldnapost stop laughing - I remember saying, aposCan you just trim the long hairs off his feet and ears apos It was awful really, because the man who had groomed him was obviously so proud of his work, so I felt like I just had to smile and let it go.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

People in Achnamara decided to join the growing number of communities getting involved in building a community boat through the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association , which encourages boat building and rowing and racing of coastal rowing boats around the Scottish coastline.The principle is that the boats should be available at as low a price as possible, with the estimated cost of completion being around £, according t the SCRA.The skf # with the St Ayles name coming from the former chapel which now forms the entrance to the Scottish Fisheries Museum # is  feet in , with a beam of ##.  The standard crew is four rowers and a coxswain.A hard core of nine to  regulars from the Achnamara area, with help from others as available, have been beavering away on their as-yet-nameless skf.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is

everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

Among the steps being considered is the creation of a -space car park between Woodbush and Church Street.Furthermore, the councilrsquos transportation team is looking at the possibility of extending the car park at the railway station, which has  spaces, while potentially putting time restrictions on the car park at Abbeylands, which is home to more than  spaces.A planning application for the new car park, which would be accessed by Lamer Street and Woodbush, has been submitted by the local authority to its own planning department.The car park, which is described as being on land adjacent to the Coastguard Cottages, could also provide parking for the nearby Assembly Rooms, which have long been earmarked for development.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: ldquoThe proposed car park is promoted to meet demand and to compensate for future road space enhancement within Dunbar town centre. It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created. He highlighted some neighbouring streets had a number of parked cars on them and this could reduce that.He said: ldquoIf you go along Church Street in Dunbar, there is very little parking."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-rocket-engine-testing-site-turned","story":"Skyroras bid to set up a base on the former coal handling plant at Port Seton had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authoritys planning committee today , the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a \"bad neighbour\".Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rockets on the land, which is central to the councils future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: \"This is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.\"Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while they applied for temporary use of the site for five years, they told the planning committee they envisaged the possibility of not just expanding their presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea outlet, to Cockenzie.And while Prestonpans Community Council, which lies on the boundary of the site, supported their move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting this week, Bryan Hickman, from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, pointed to a public meeting which had seen between  and  people turn out.He said: \"Virtually everyone who was there was against it ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.

A fundamental sht has taken place, not only in Englandrsquos mindset, but the manner in which its voters were induced to back Mr Johnson.What  have we learned from this extraordinary election  Well, herersquos my initial take. I look forward to hearing yours.. The ruthless, despicable tactics used by Dominic Cummings and Vote Leave to win the EU referendum campaign were not an aberration. As Mr Johnsonrsquos victory highlights, they are the new norm. Wersquore going to have to get used to digital s and elements of the media spreading misinformation like wildfire, possible foreign interventions, bamboozling distraction techniques, blatant dishonesty during broadcast interviews. How the Conservativesrsquo opponents respond will be crucial. Play it clean and be crushed, or get dirty, too, and join in them in the moral sell-out  You decide.. Simple slogans ndash especially those created by the aforementioned Cummings ndash really do work. By the end of the campaign just about every voter vox-popped in England seemed to be parroting the ldquowe just need to get Brexit done line. This undoubtedly helped consolidate the pro-Brexit vote around the Tories.. Labourrsquos claim to be the party of working people no longer stands up. Jeremy Corbyn and his disciples can blame media bias for his partyrsquos disastrous result till the cows come home but it wonrsquot change the fact that their man and his policies were a monumental turn-off across the partyrsquos traditional heartlands. Labourrsquos disastrous stance on Brexit didnrsquot help, but the rejection goes deeper. The fact that people living in poverty believed Boris Johnson would look after their interests better than a lelong socialist is both grim and fascinating. Sadly for the poor, we canrsquot bet on Labour facing up to these harsh truths any time soon.. Speaking of Labour claims that donrsquot stand up, we can surely all now agree that a Labour government is not going to ldquosave Scotland, either from the Tories or independence. This ridiculous and out-dated argument was still being peddled on doorsteps, not only by London-based Labour but many in the Scottish party, too. It really would be in the partyrsquos interests to accept that comparing independence ndash which for the vast majority of supporters is based on a simple desire for self-determination ndash to Farage-style nationalism is not only highly insulting, but as wersquove seen for years, electoral suicide. There have been signs over the weekend that at least some in Scottish Labour are waking up. Too little, too late  Quite possibly.. The evisceration of the Lib Dems tells us that Jo Swinson ran a flawed campaign based on a fatal overestimation of her own popularity. It also suggests England doesnrsquot like three-party politics.Or hung parliaments. You can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of electoral reform.. The SNP-Tory stand-off over Indyref cannot go on forever. Both sides are already upping the ante, with Mr Johnson and Michael Gove categorically ruling out another referendum, and Nicola Sturgeon intensying the narrative with talk of Scotland being ldquoheld prisoner. Such shadow boxing plays well to both partiesrsquo core support, of course, but eventually one side will have to go for the knockout blow. Itrsquos hard to see what more Ms Sturgeon can do in the face of such denials and hypocrisyfrom a tin-eared PM buoyed by a right-wing majority, at least until the Holyrood elections of . However Mr Johnson, who purports to be a classical scholar, would do well to learn lessons from more recent events, not least the unstoppable push for devolution that resulted from Mrs Thatcherrsquos condescending and contemptuous attitude towards Scotland during her - year stint as PM. The unpredictable nature of the Johnson-Cummings premiership means you never know what will happen, of course. Will they fancy calling the SNPrsquos bluff  Time will tell.. Meantime, the SNP needs to fashion fresh and persuasive arguments for independence in the post-Brexit world, with palatable solutions to the dficult questions and scenarios created by the UK leaving the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"long-lost-live-recording-legendary-scots-band-josef-k-resurfaces","story":"ldquoThe only thing I really remember is the snare drum breaking, says Haig.Ross recalls how, ldquoIt broke on the first song. Ronnie Torrance, the drummer, had left all his spare skins in the studio in Brussels, so we had to carry on without a snare and improvise for about four songs. Fortunately for us, Lene Lovichrsquos road crew were there, and they lent us their snare drum. Listening to it again, Ronnie copes with it amazingly well. When it broke, it made things seem kind of hard. It was quite a prestigious gig, I remember. We were only playing a short set, but it wasnrsquot a nightclub. It was a theatre set up, and was quite formal and quite staid.The unintended snare drum incident nevertheless gives the recording of Josef Krsquos April  performance an extra edge that can be heard on The Scottish Affair , a lavishly packaged record of the show released on limited edition clear vinyl by Les Disques du Crepescule. The chic Belgian label promoted the concert at the Beursschouwburg venue in Brussels following a multi-media extravaganza on Hogmanay four months earlier. That was at the warehouse-based Plan K alongside Postcard Records label-mates Orange Juice.Josef K had released their debut single, Chance Meeting, on Orange Juice drummer Steven Dalyrsquos Absolute label. Their two follow ups on Postcard, Radio Drill Time and Itrsquos Kinda Funny, mixed angular urgency with downbeat lyrics that made for a kind of existential disco.With Crepescule forging international connections, Josef K had recorded their Sorry for Laughing single for them during their first visit. This captured the raw sound that had eluded them on previous recordings, including that of the album that was awaiting release. They decreed to re-record it in Brussels during their second visit, and it was this that was released as The Only Fun in Town, its seemingly self-sabotaging release foreshadowing the bandrsquos split in August.Ross remembers the Brussels trip as having ldquoa real sense of optimism and excitement that things were moving forward. We did feel we were part of a kind of change of the guard in terms of what was going on musically. Josef K would always try and do something, not totally experimental, but not just the same things that wersquod done before. We were so young then, and I think we were quite naiumlve, trying to find new chord structures and all that, then as you get older and learn more, you realise why theyrsquore structured the way they are.Europe may seem an increasingly distant place right now for a new generation of home-grown talent with ideas above their station. For Haig, Ross and the other members of Josef K, drummer Torrance and bass player Davy Weddell, their first trips abroad as part of what was effectively a trans-global Crepescule salon, it was an adventure. The bandrsquos name may have been drawn from Czech novelist Franz Kafkarsquos existential novel, but Brussels seemed just as exotic.ldquoPaul and I used to read European literature in translation, remembers Ross, ldquoand we always felt we had an affinity with Europe.The European romance they envisaged was slightly dferent from the harsh realities of le on the road. ldquoWe did that terrible journey in a Bedford van, with loads of things going wrong, says Haig, ldquobut when we got to Brussels, it was great to just be able to to a cafeacute and have a proper French coffee. We liked our coffee and cigarettes, but you couldnrsquot get that it Scotland. Then we met the Crepescule crowd, and they had it much more together than we did. They all had flats and everything, and we were these pale little Scottish guys pretending to be sophisticated.The album cover image for The Scottish Affairis a reproduction of the poster for the Beursschouwburg gig, featuring artwork by Jean-Francois Octave that epitomised the ennui of serious young men. The -odd minute recording itself captures Josef K at their frenetic peak.ldquoSome moments sound really intense, says Haig. ldquoItrsquos always a bit weird going back, because it feels like a letime ago, but I think it stands up.Once Josef K split, Haig formed Rhythm of Le, a loose-knit umbrella organisation that produced a couple of singles before releasing numerous albums under his own name. Having briefly come up for air a decade ago for a handful of rare live dates, Haig continues to release new material, with his most recent album, The Wood, released last year on Les Disques du Crepescule.Ross joined Orange Juice, then Aztec Camera before embarking on a solo career that saw him release two albums. He made an album with The Low Mfs, and is currently part of The Bum-Clocks with Fire Engines drummer Russell Burn and his actor brother Tam Dean Burn. The Bum-Clocks also form part of Out of the Ordinary, the Edinburgh supergroup put together by maverick singer and composer, Joseph Malik.Both Haig and Ross express surprise at Josef Krsquos increasing cache over the years. This has come about through ious compilations, name-checks as an influence by the likes of Franz Ferdinand and their appearance in Grant McPheersquos Scottish post-punk documentary, Big Gold Dream. The release of The Scottish Affairadds to the historicising of their brief but vital lespan.ldquoI think for people interested in music of that period itrsquos an interesting document of its time, says Ross.For Haig, ldquoI think itrsquos quite an important document of what we were like that night, and because itrsquos a live experience it gives people who never had the chance to see Josef K an idea of how fast and intense it all was. Listening to it now, sometimes it takes me back, and sometimes itrsquos quite uncomfortable, but you really get the feeling it was a special night.The Scottish Affairby Josef K is available now on Les Disques du Crepescule. www.lesdisquesducrepescule"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10808356.jpg?type=article-full","title":"english-child-runaways-see-scots","story":"With a sixpence and three farthings, a bag of stale buns, ration books, bathing suits and the clothes they were wearing, they decided to embark on what they saw as an adventure, without a single adult to supervise.Now,  years after the Richardson childrens escapade that has been compared to an Enid Blyton tale, they have relived the experience of travelling  miles from Hertfordshire in  for the island of Lewis, and their idea of \"paradise\".:The mystery of the meteorite that struck the Isle of LewisThe plan was hatched by schoolchildren Millie and Syd Richardson on August , .With the war slowly receding in peoples minds, people were enjoying freedoms denied them during years of blackouts and air raid shelters.Mr Richardson, now  said: [We werent] keen on hanging around here.

Although oil pricesremain an important factor, the relentless focus on cost and industry collaboration on a range of issues provides a solid framework for investors.ldquoThis is an industry already in action with our blueprint for net zero outlining our commitment to emissions reduction from the operational production of oil and gas while providing the safe, sustainable and competitive energy the UK needs.Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said prices should not matter ndash the planet should.He said: ldquoThe true cost of North Sea oil and gas is too high for our climate. The price per barrel should be measured in the climate-changing emissions it releases and destruction it brings to the most vulnerable people and places on earth.ldquoTackling the climate emergency means we must ban oil and gas exploration, and redirect the vast subsidies propping up fossil fuel extraction towards creating decent green jobs in a zero carbon economy.ldquoAll exploration should stop now, no new licences should be issued and current fields should be run down over the next decade as part of a just transition to clean energy jobs.ldquoIf you are in an emergency, the first thing to do is stop making it worse.

Itrsquos a technology the Committee on Climate Change has stated is critical and needed at scale to meet the UKrsquos world-leading climate change commitments.The full-chain Acorn project is set to be operational by the early s and is just one example of how this sector is working to find solutions to develop a lower carbon economy.: Scotlands oil boom can last another  yearsIt was Abraham Lincoln who said the best way to predict the future is to create it. From Peterhead to Southampton, the hundreds of companies which support the production of oil and gas from UK waters are changing to realise the opportunities of a more erse and lower carbon energy mix.With commercial opportunity, a societal push for faster and more effective change to reduce emissions, and government support, the foundations are in place for an energy transition. Just as the UK moved from burning wood to coal and then in the rsquos to gas, wersquore looking to a future where our needs for energy and industrial products are more erse, sustainable and efficient. The agenda-setting Committee on Climate Change report published in May showed that oil and gas currently provide  per cent of the UKrsquos total energy needs. By  we estimate this will be about a third. But what does this mean for our industry First, we know that the UK will continue to need oil and gas as part of this erse energy mix. The Scottish Government has agreed thatwe close down the North Sea without first reducing demand we would only lsquooffshorersquo even more of our emissions as we would need to increase the UKrsquos reliance on imported oil and gas.We would also lose the additional benefits of the UK industry of jobs, tax revenue and the engineering expertise that is helping transform our energy system. However, itrsquos important we produce oil and gas with ever reducing emissions. Unlike our Norwegian partners, most North Sea s arenrsquot connected to the electricity grid and produce the power they need for cooking, heating and operations through gas or diesel generators. UK companies are already in action, with some working on linking offshore renewables to oil and gas s.We know that sustainability and competitiveness are intrinsically linked. While oil price is important, efficiency and competitiveness are within the industryrsquos control and as we have been emerging from one of the toughest downturns in our history the sector has proved its ability to improve both.: Scotland must be bold to meet climate emergency targetsSecond, supporting over , UK jobs and with a world-class supply chain renowned for finding solutions to complex problems, we are an industry with skill, capability and infrastructure. OGUKrsquos Energy Transition Outlook made the case for action to progress Carbon Capture Usage and Storage , and our members are already in action in the UK and internationally to develop CCUS and hydrogen at scale.As our report also made clear, this is an industry which will need to earn its position in this new energy world. Itrsquos why earlier this year we published lsquoRoadmap : a blueprint for net zerorsquo. Itrsquos one of the first industrial responses to commitments to deliver net zero emissions by  in Scotland, and  in the UK. Setting out five areas where industry, government and regulator action is underway or is needed. It will help enable a safe and competitive industry that realises its full potential in the energy transition.Finally, we know that having a vision and a plan matter. The painful transition from coal and the fate of that industry in the UK casts a long shadow. We have a duty to reflect seriously on lessons from that change as we look to Scotland and the UKrsquos energy future.lsquoRoadmap : a blueprint for net zerorsquo, offers a compelling vision developed through over , conversations with people who work in or with our sector. Delivery of the Roadmap means that by  we are on track to be a net zero basin, reducing emissions from the production of oil and gas by increasing efficiency, and switching power from gas or diesel generators to low carbon resources.Itrsquos a future where our industry plays a key role in a erse energy mix and in developing the technologies to help heavy industries deal with their emissions. We continue to thrive at the cutting edge of technologies and innovation, carrying those skills into dferent energy sectors, and using this success, our supply chain is bringing billions into the UK through exporting its skills across the world.: Radium dump site in Dalgety Bay posts no signicant cancer riskThere is no doubt of the urgency to help find solutions. We live in a world where increasing demand for energy sits alongside the need for ever-decreasing emissions.Achieving net zero will require serious and committed collaboration and action from industries, governments, regulators and every inidual in every community, working together to find solutions instead of seeking isions. As we look to COP in Glasgow next year, we should be in no doubt that the eye of the world will be on us and we must be prepared to come to the table with deeds and not just words.

They thought that they could ignore their democratic duty to implement the result and they continued their Remain campaign in the guise of being the Parliamentary Opposition. However, the voters were not fooled. They had voted to Leave and they expected Parliament to implement their decision. Seeing the Remain MPs hindering, not helping, and seeing them drag out the process with squabbling and negativity, did not win over the electorate, but on the contrary made them resentful and impatient to see Brexit carried out. Therefore, when the Conservatives appealed to them with \"Get Brexit Done\", that proved to be a vote-winning slogan and the UK now has a large Conservative majority in Parliament.Jeremy Corbyn failed because he could not deal with the strong cohort of Remain MPs in his party. If Labour had implemented Brexit as it should have done as its democratic duty, there would have been no election and the Labour Party would not be in the disarray that it is in. Of course, there is no likelihood that the Remain faction, whether in Parliament, the Labour Party or in the media, will accept any responsibility for what has happened. They do not care that the referendum result created a democratic duty and that thwarting Brexit was a denial of democracy. Not our fault, they say. All Mr Corbyns fault. And so the hapless Mr Corbyn is left to take the blame for the ruination of Labour.I am sorry to see Labour brought so low and I am sorry to see Mr Corbyn unjustly blamed for all that has happened. Nevertheless, it is good to see that democracy has been upheld. The EU referendum in which  million people voted was the largest exercise of democracy that the UK has ever known. The decision was taken to Leave and the General Election result is in keeping with that decision.Les Reid, Edinburgh EH.WErsquoRE used to Unionists applying double standards when it comes to democracy:  per cent is a resounding mandate for the Tories to take the UKout of the EU but not enough for the SNP to ask for the Scots to have a bare choice in their future. Now Kenny Wilsonasserts that ldquomany who voted for the SNP in the General Election are not independence supporters and, further down in the same letter: ldquoPractically every person who would vote for independence is likely to have voted SNP last week.Rubbish. Even within my own circle I know several people who not only support independence but campaigned for it and will do so again yet in this General Election they voted Labour in the vain hope of stopping this right-wing Tory Government.Mary McCabe, Glasgow G.AS expected, Nicola Sturgeon ramps up the rhetoric, demanding the powers to organise an early second independence referendum.However, I wonderher urgency is driven not only by the SNPs dominance in terms of seats won, but by a newly-arrived feeling of worry When Boris Johnson became Prime Minister towards the end of July, he was widely and correctly portrayed by the media generally as a man who would be struggling to control elements in his own party, let alone the wider political and economic world. He would eventually have to make an embarrassing climbdown, as the shortest-duration Prime Minister of the UK.When the election campaign itself got under way, there was much talk amongst the commentariat about a narrowing Tory lead in the polls. The best that Mr Johnson could hope for was to scrape home with a tiny majority, with major figures in the Government either being defeated or ed with wafer-thin margins, because of widespread tactical voting, hundreds of thousands of --year-oldd registering to vote, the large majority of whom would be pro-Corbyn, and so on. There seemed to be much discussion about the possibility of a minority Labour government granting the Section  order in order to draw on SNP support.Then, on the late evening of Thursday, December  was the exit poll, followed by Friday morning. That just wasnt supposed to happen.I wondera scintilla of doubt crept into Ms Sturgeons mind that,the effete posh boy, widely portrayed as a blustering, philandering buffoon, could pull off that sort of result, he might just make a success of Brexit, and damage the SNPs credibility.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THERE will obviously be a great deal of sound and fury in the coming weeks, months and years regarding a future attempt by the SNP to overturn the result of the self-determination of the Scottish electorate through a second referendum on independence. At this early stage, it hard to see how this will turn out. At the same time, I am pleased to see that Scottish Labour is to develop its own \"constitutional offer\" to the Scottish people My view is that there should never a referendum on any subject ever again in the UK, butwe do have to have them, surely there should be a better legal framework to set out who can call them, under what circumstances, on which subjects, whether thresholds for supportare necessary or desirable, and how long should be left between referendums on the same subject.I would suggest that Scottish Labour consults with constitutional and electoral law experts to compile a draft of such a legal framework and adopt it as its own policy on this matter. Andother parties wish to sign up to it in the interests of democracy, so much the better.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.I MUST congratulate Mark Smith on his excellent article . I sincerely hope he is proved right come .In the meantime we have to endure the incessant calls for another independence referendum. My main concern is that the SNP has not to my knowledge articulated how the near pound billion black hole in Scotlands finances would be addressedwe were to become an independent country. I for one do not wish to face the prospect of large tax increases by whatever form. I recall the SNP once describing the Brexit deal as being like taking the economy blindfolded over the clf edge. As far as I am concerned, that is exactly what the SNP is doing to us with independence.Brian Douglas, Ayr.AS our new SNP MPs take their seats, I would like to congratulate them.However, I totally disagree with this democratic result. I simply do not accept it. Unionist parties received more votes. I will complain about it every day. I will campaign at every moment to overturn it.

In relation to those crowing and gloating over the UK-wide Conservative victory, I would draw attention to an old Gaelic proverb which translates: \"Therersquos meat and music here, as the fox said, running away with the bagpipes.\" And with reference to the character of the Conservative leader, Boris Johnson, and anticipating what might lie ahead for us, the proverb which come to mind is the Russian one: \"A fish rots from the head down.\"Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.THE fact that the SNP obtained \"only\"  per cent of the Scottish vote is being used by some people asit were some kind of diminution of their success in the election, or of the force of their policy statements. Given that every voter in Scotland had a choice of candidates representing at least four parties and many had five, six or even more to choose from, I would say that a party which has managed to pick up nearly as much electoral support as all the others put together has achieved a truly astonishing degree of success, and has acquired as strong a mandate as is conceivably possible.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB.IM intrigued by Ian Lakins assertionthat the six Scottish Tory MPs will have \"substantial influence\" with Boris Johnson.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

scotrail franchise three years early","story":"The future control of the operator is in doubt after ministers acted with no clear plans for a replacement operator.The offshoot of Dutch state railways will have its ten-year contract ended three years early in March  after failing to get more money to run the service.The Scotsman understands Abellio sought a ldquovery substantial uplt in annual subsidies of some £ million a year because of the poor economy and major problems such as late-delivered new trains.Despite complaints about poor punctuality, performance does not appear to have been a factor in the decision, and it is slowly improving.Transport secretary Michael Matheson said he would now ldquoexamine the options for a new operator, which are uncertain because of the UK governmentrsquos ongoing review of the rail franchising system.Unless that leads to changes, Mr Matheson is likely to have to invite bids for a new franchise, albeit this time the public sector would be allowed to compete against train firms for the first time.It is the Scottish Governmentrsquos single biggest contract.BACKGROUND: ScotRail given £m early to cover shortfallsAbellio UK managing director Dominic Booth condemned Mr Mathesonrsquos decision as the ldquowrong choice and warned further improvements were likely to be \"delayed or put at risk\".These include new, longer trains on the Glasgow to Gourock, Wemyss Bay, East Kilbride and Barrhead routes, and Edinburgh to Fe and the Borders.A planned new station at East Linton in East Lothian could be delayed, along with more frequent trains on the Glasgow to Dumfries and Oban Mallaig line.Abellio has lost tens of millions of pounds since taking over ScotRail in  and hoped to make a small profit in its revised offer.New trains delayedIt has been hit by setbacks such as major delays to two new fleets of trains because of problems with manufacturers and refitters.Only a third of one fleet is in service, a year after it should have been fully operating.By contrast, the punctuality figure on which ScotRail is measured by ministers has been improving since summer , albeit it is more than  percentage points below target, which is not expected to be reached until .However, punctuality over the latest four-week period ndash traditionally poor because of fallen leaves which cause slippery rails ndash is the best for that period for five years.An industry source told The Scotsman: ldquoItrsquos clear from this news that Abellio ScotRail had bigger issues with its finances than performance.\"The business has lost tens of millions of pounds and it would be unsustainable for both Abellio and Transport Scotland to see it through its full ten-year term.We must focus on our missionIn a message to staff, ScotRail managing director Alex Hynes said: ldquoThe key reason given by the [Scottish] Government was that, in its view, revising the current contract and carrying it on until  wouldnrsquot provide value for money for the taxpayer.ldquoI know this news creates uncertainty for us all, but we must remain focused on our mission.\"Therersquos no impact on your job or your pay.Almost all of ScotRailrsquos , staff are expected to transfer to whoever takes over, on their current conditions, as happened when Abellio took over from First in .Mr Matheson told MSPs: ldquoAny changes to the level of subsidy paid by the government must deliver new benefits for passengers and taxpayers, and whilst there have been improvements in recent years, the proposed changes were not sufficient to justy additional subsidy.ldquoOf course, the Scottish Government must plan for the future of our rail services, beyond , and work is already under way to examine the options open to us in this regard.Scottish Conservatives transport spokesman Jamie Greene said: ldquoPulling the rug from under the feet of the current operator will do nothing to improve performance, deliver better value for money or encourage future investment in our railways.ldquoThere are serious questions to be asked of SNP ministers as to how they came to this conclusion and why they think this provides stability or makes financial sense to the taxpayer.Scottish Labour transport spokesman Colin Smyth said: ldquoWhat we now must know isthe Scottish Government intend to make a serious public sector bid for control of ScotRail or whether our railways will be flogged off once more to a foreign-based private company focused only on profit.Hugely disappointedBut Mr Booth said: ldquoWe are hugely disappointed by this decision and believe itrsquos the wrong choice for Scotlandrsquos railway and its customers.ldquoAbellio has invested more than £million in new and upgraded trains, added  per cent more seats for customers and created more than  extra jobs in Scotland since the start of the franchise in  - the biggest investment in trains and stations in over  years.ldquoOur offer to Transport Scotland would have delivered an improved service for our customers at a reduced cost to the taxpayer. ldquoWe will remain fully committed to running a safe and reliable service until the end of the contract in . \"While this decision creates unnecessary uncertainty for more than , staff and our customers, we will maintain our focus on delivering vital projects for Scotlandrsquos Railway and seeing through the delivery of signicant customer benefits until .: Inside Transport - Scotlandrsquos railways is the story that keeps on giving but often not in a good wayTransport Scotland said the current franchise agreement required ministers and Abellio to revisit the level of government subsidy provided for the remaining five years of the contract and to determine whether additional subsidy should be paid, which is known as \"rebasing\".It said that following \"considerable analysis and careful consideration of the information provided by Abellio ScotRail\", ministers had decided the \"signicant increase in subsidy proposed would not secure delivery of commensurate benefits to passengers, communities and the economy\".It said ministers had served a \"no rebasing notice\" on Abellio ScotRail.Passengers will judgeRobert Samson, senior stakeholder manager in Scotland for passenger watchdog Transport Focus said: \"Over the next two years, passengers will expect a more punctual and reliable railway that improves passenger satisfaction as tracked by our national rail passenger survey.ldquoIt is good to see the government seeking value for money on behalf of passengers, but any change must not result in disruption for them.ldquoPassengers will judge the success of any future changes to the structure of the railway on how far it meets their priorities for improvement: more punctual and reliable services, more chance of getting a seat and better value for money.Kevin Lindsay, Scotland organiser for train drivers union Aslef, said: lsquoWe are delighted by the decision announced today because we have argued for a long time that Abellio has been letting down passengers and staff here in Scotland.\"We also welcome the opportunity for a public service provider to bid

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter.

So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built .."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DUNVEGAN-PS-CALUM-CAMPBELL-1-2.jpg","title":"ian blackford seeks meeting with highland council leader amid local unrest over skye school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHe has written to Highland Council leader Margaret Davidson to request a meeting on the matter.The SNP candidate#s comments come a week after the council gave the green light for the first phase of a new primary school in Dunvegan to be built on the local sports playing field, despite alternative plans being proposed by local community members.The sports pitch was chosen as the council#s preferred location to site the £ million first phase development as they said it would allow further expansion of the school # and would also ensure that the final layout is as safe as possible with regard to access and separation of traffic and pedestrians.However, the North West Skye Recreational Society secured £, of funding from the Dunvegan Trust to upgrade the pitch to Scottish Football Association standards. The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2485-Kylerhea-landslip.jpg","title":"skye visitors cooking class on the back burner following kylerhea","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineDaniela Celant left her holiday home in Kylerhea to drive to Kinloch Lodge earlier this afternoon to take part in a cooking class with top chef Marcello Tully.

One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do.

We have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the NMC figures,\" added Ms Cullen.\"Our members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service.\"Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged.\"Further strikes are planned for January  and  ahead of the January  deadline for politicians here to re-establish the Assembly.A breakthrough to bring an end to the health service crisis appeared unlikely on Wednesday night, with the relationship between the Secretary of State, the Department of Health, unions and politicians disintegrating even further.Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has refused to budge from his position that health is a devolved matter.After roundtable talks with the political parties, he said again he was unable to intervene and approach the Treasury for additional funding.However, unions have rejected this stance. They have also accused Mr Smith of using the crisis as leverage to force the political parties back into talks to re-establish the Assembly.Patricia McKeown from Unison launched a stinging attack on the head of the local Civil Service, David Sterling.He and the permanent secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, have insisted that they cannot bring pay into line with the rest of the UK because it would mean overturning a ministerial decision.In an open letter to Mr Sterling, Ms McKeown argued this position was incorrect and hit out at comments he made in a letter sent to the leaders of the political parties on Tuesday.In the correspondence, Mr Sterling said that in order to meet pay parity demands, the Department of Health would need an additional £m every year.He said this money could alternatively be used to pay for additional activity to reduce the number of people on waiting lists each year by ,.\"It is important to note that other Northern Ireland departments are currently dealing with serious budgetary pressure, including pay pressures,\" he wrote.\"Indeed, there are currently industrial disputes in other parts of the public sector.\"The principle of public sector pay parity is clearly cross-cutting, with potential implications well beyond health.\" In response, Ms McKeown hit out at the fact that Mr Sterling has still not responded to a letter Unison sent to him on November , in which the union sought his intervention to resolve the ongoing dispute.Describing Mr Sterlings letter as \"a deeply unhelpful intervention\", she said she was \"shocked by the apparent attempt to mislead party leaders and the overtly political tone of the letter\".She said a letter from the five political parties providing cover to allow civil servants to meet unions pay demands was sufficient political authority for him to act.\"This having now been provided, we seriously question your failure to act,\" she added.She also said Mr Sterling and the Department of Finance have been creating pay policy in the absence of ministers, such as a recent announcement of a review of public sector pay.Ms McKeown also rejected the argument that there was no ministerial decision to break parity and said that it had instead been argued that the move was necessary to enable the Department of Health to break even.She added: \"We have repeatedly stated that the Treasury should provide whatever additional resources are needed to restore the pay gap.\"You have a clear role in making that argument to them.\"Health workers have kept the system running in the face of continued cuts and austerity.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic and travel strangford ferry sailings back on","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the father of six in bleach.The company’s other directors, including Tony Lunney, Liam McCaffrey, Dara O’Reilly and John McCartin, met with Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on Tuesday evening and received an update on the gardai’s ongoing investigation into criminality and intimidation of QIH staff.“The directors are very encouraged by arrests over recent weeks and by the scale of resources

by the support and goodwill of our staff, the community, our public representatives and business partners, for which we are extremely grateful.“We remain committed to the business and community and look forward to the conclusion of the work being undertaken by the gardai.”The attack on Mr Lunney, during which his assailants demanded his resignation, was the most serious of a five-year campaign of intimidation targeting the companies and directors that now control the business portfolio that was built up by fallen tycoon Sean Quinn, once Ireland’s richest man.A sinister element in the community in the Fermanagh Cavan border area, where the companies are based, continues to vent anger at the demise of Mr Quinn’s empire.The establishment of the first-ever joint investigation involving An Garda Siochana and the PSNI was set up to investigate the attack and intimidation of its management.Four men charged with the kidnap and torture of the businessman have been remanded in custody.A convicted criminal considered a key suspect in Mr Lunney’s abduction died during a police raid in England.Known gangster and smuggler Cyril McGuinness suffered a heart attack while

This leaves  providers who have not yet received quotes.“There may be a very small number of very high risk services which will not receive quotations.“With regard to the issue of insurance, I’m liaising with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a review of insurance in the childcare sector as part of the ongoing independent review of costs that I’m doing in the sector.“Consequently, we need to make the market more attractive to both existing insurers and to new entrants in order to increase competition which in turn should lead to a reduction of pricing in an increase in capacity.”Labour’s Sean Sherlock said he had been contacted by childcare providers whose risk profile has not changed, but have been told their insurance costs are increasing six-fold.Mr Sherlock added: “What you’re saying, and I say this respectfully, doesn’t give those providers any comfort.”Sinn Fein’s Kathleen Funchion said she was concerned that the support programme would not help everyone.She added: “There is total panic this week and I just feel like it always seems to land on the shoulders of the workers and the providers.“For some of those people , euro will be a help but for some of the them it won’t.”Fianna Fail’s Robert Troy said that where there is a monopoly, there is an opportunity to overcharge.He called for the minister to help bring in the necessary reforms and incentivise more firms into the market.“While the announcement you made today is welcome, it’s a sticking plasterwe don’t actually address this and bring insurance premiums down,” he added.“We shouldn’t have to use tax resources to supplement the insurance industry and that’s what’s happening now.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dunkirk and dark knight director to collect cbe","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He attended St. Peters from  - and left with one O Level in English. This week he was awarded a PhD for a thesis assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes. In the midst of the Troubles it was a dficult time for young people to focus on their studies.Maurice said: “For me, leaving school with one O Level and thinking I was stupid, to get into such a prestigious course and successfully completing it is a proud moment.”The Derry man is proof that le is about learning as despite leaving school with few qualications he immersed himself in study and has used it to help others through decades of social and community work.After spending some time on the dole, at -years-old Maurice began voluntary work as a youth worker and enrolled in an Addiction Studies course at Ulster University Magee.This coincided with work at Northlands Addiction Treatment Centre. Maurice believes alcohol was, and still is, the single biggest issue facing Derry. “The problem is that people don’t even view it as a drug, but it’s more powerful than most and one of the few drugs that actually damages the body just by taking it.”The heavy binge drinking culture that exists in Ireland is the source of many social ills, he said. “The main reason children are taken into care, neglect, is often down to parents having a drink problem.” googletag.cmd.push Treatment projects In January  he moved to London to work in a residential alcohol treatment project where he attained a diploma in alcohol counselling at the University of Kent. The following year he got a job as manager at the alcohol treatment centre, a post he held for four years.When planning toto live in Derry he believed that with a social work qualication he could secure a steady job and therefore applied for the professional social work training course at the University of Ulster.“The best thing about it was that it gave me an academic qualication and also a professional qualication which would allow me to be employed.“I graduated in  and started working right away with the Foyle Health and Social Services Trust in the Leaving and After Care Team, supporting young people who are leaving care and preparing to live independently in the community.”In  he, and local community worker, Frankie McMenamin, established the local charity, Zest, an organisation providing supportive care and counselling to young people struggling with suicidal ideation and self-harm. Maurice managed Zest for  years before leaving to pursue other interests.At the turn of the millennium until  he was part of the first Drug Arrest Referral scheme in Northern Ireland. The scheme was managed by the Western Health and Social Care TrustAlcohol and Dug Service and required daily attendance at the Strand Road Police Station. It was an innovative project through which all persons detained at the police station were offered support to address alcohol and drug problems. googletag.cmd.push PhD studies  In  he was grant aided by the Public Health Agency to undertake a fellowship at Queens University Belfast.His PhD involved “assessing the readiness of domestically violent men to engage in domestic violence rehabilitation programmes” in Northern Ireland. “A lot of men drop out of these rehabilitation programmes and what research has found is that when these men drop out they actually present as a greater risk to victims compared tothey had never been referred. “Amongst other things, the research established the men who completed the programme stopped drinking before or at the start of the programme, whereas the men who dropped out of the programme had continued to drink alcohol.“Because of the way alcohol affects the brain,you’re not drinking you’re far more alert and your brain can make connections and you can develop insight to understand yourself.“Butyou’re drinking during the week then it slows the brain’s ability to make sense of things.”He is now working to rehabilitate men who have been domestically violent. “We know prison doesn’t work and most of the men never receive the help that they need,” Maurice said. ‘Compassion’ When he ed to the WHSCT from his secondment at Queens University Belfast, Maurice began working as part of the Domestic Violence Team. Here he set up the first group-based and inidualised domestic violence treatment programmes run by the WHSCT. The demands entailed in establishing the new programme meant that it took longer than initially anticipated to finish the PhD.However, this year he successfully completed the PhD which is the culmination of eight and a half years of hard work.Sadly, his parents aren’t alive to share what is a high point on le’s journey but his children and other family members attended the graduation ceremony. “I’m really looking forward to the event, my daughter and son are going with me,” he said.Asked about the lessons he’s learned through his studies and decades of paid and voluntary work, he said: “No matter what sort of problems a person has, human beings have a massive capacity to change but you have to have the right support and help, which has to be provided in a non-judgemental and compassionate manner.“You can condemn behaviour, but not the person. You have to believe in the persons inherent worth and in their ability to bring about the change they need. Change is possible but people need the right support network in place.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Early goals from Niall McGonagle and Rian McCormick gave Claudy the perfect start after five minutes. Downpatrick replied with a Dara OShea goal in a crowded penalty area and with Rian Burns adding another goal on one of his many forays from wing-back, De La Salle were in control. Adam Murphy was in fine form at midfield for the winners as they dug themselves back into contention but trailed - to - at the interval. It couldve been more, but Downpatrick had a third goal disallowed for square ball. googletag.cmd.push Brian Raineys men were the better team overall. With Niall McGonagle playing anywhere from centre-back to full-forward, they had a leader. In Tiarnan OConnor, they had the perfect inside forward with his movement and vision. Tiarnan OConnor scored- for Claudy. Two fortunate goals from midfielders Murphy and Oisin Kearns-Madden early in the second-half turned the game. Downpatrick replied when James Crangle bagged a goal from the rebound after his penalty was acrobatically saved by Claudy goalkeeper Cahir Melaugh. Led by Oran Carton and Ben Cooke, Claudys defence then shut up shop with a determination that meant there was only ever going to be one winner. googletag.cmd.push Downpatrick lost Nathan Kelly on a second booking and with Tiarnan OConnor and substitute Niall Barr linking well in attack, Claudy advanced to the final. POLL: Who was your man of the match  They now face the winners of the second semi-final between Castleblayney College and St Clares Ballyjamesduff. Recently retired Monaghan star Vinny Corey was among those in attendance and will have a handle on what Claudy have to offer. He will have saw Niall McGonagle limp off with a heavily strapped leg. The Dungiven man now faces a fitness battle over the Christmas holidays ahead of the final. For a full report, grab a copy of next weeks County Derry Post, in shops on Monday, December .

In their third final in succession, the Buncrana Road school - managed by Bliadhan Glass and Gearailt Oacute Mianaacutein - came from four points down to take the honours, thanks to two goals from Adam Rankin. A number of their players turned in good performances well led by Michael Lynch at centre-half back. Michael and Ronan Moore in the full-back line, Padhraig Nelis, Adam Rankin and Donegal under-age star Conor Gartland up front all shone. googletag.cmd.push Although Conor Gartland opened the scoring with a point, St Malachy’s enjoyed most of the possession over the next  minutes and three points inside two minutes from Niall O’Connor, Conor McNicholl and Anthony McGarrigle put them - to - up. O’Connor andConn MacFarlane added points before the key score of the half, a breakaway goal from St Columb’s with Adam Rankin pulling on a through ball that Bailey Graham half saved but the sliotar slipped over the line. Jude Oacuteg Moore added a point and the Derry side had something to hang on to going into the break, despite Michael Devenny striking a goal for St Malachy’s, who led - to - at the turnover. It couldve been more only for a save by St Columbs goalkeeper Oisin Duddy. googletag.cmd.push During the first  minutes of the second-half, St Columb’s drew level with points from their captain Michael Lynch , Jude oacuteg Moore and Conor Gartland. Then as he had done in the first half, Adam Rankin got on the end of a move down the right wing and he flashed a shot to the top corner. Lynch and Martin added points and St Columb’s looked to be safe. However they spent the last quarter in their own half defending stubbornly and could not add to their total. Signicantly however their defence locked in well and only conceded a point from a free scored by Niall O’Connor as the Shield went to the Buncrana Road for the first time. St Columb’s: Oisin Duddy, Carrick McClean, Michael Moore, Ronan Moore, Aidan Meehan, Michael Lynch , Oisin O’Kane, Kealan O’Kane, Aidan Cutlfe, Padhraig Nelis, Adam Rankin , Jude Oacuteg Moore , Tom Martin , Conor Gartland , Adam Breslin St Malachy’s: B Graham,O Smyth, O Kennedy, C McCann, R McCloskey, D Maguire, L O’Connor, N O’Connor , E McCartan, C MacFarlane , C McNicholl , D Turley, M Devenny , M Branf, A McGarrigle .Subs: C Morgan, R Eager, M Oacuteg Dunne.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Luckily these people are musical experts and are all too willing to share their fountains of knowledge, making for heart-warming scenes that inspire happy endings for films. I can hear you scrambling for your hats and scarves already, but slow down. Before you get distracted by whatever nonsense the council have paid someone that hasn’t got the first the idea what’s going on in this town to entertain you, let your uncle Kev guide you through the unmissable events occurring round this festive season. After a serious round of promotion for their first album, Phillip J Wallace and Oisin Cannon are readying their follow up. They’ve given hints live of rfier times ahead and their last single “Beatz Ahoy” and the word on the street is there’ll be a new album sometime soon. Armed with some of the finest tunes, weirdest set up and best delivery Waldorf  Cannon play Bennigans on Monday, December  with Teknopeasantand me firing out a lock of tunes in between times.They released their debut album this year and have played some of the more well attended gigs in the town and Jeanette and Noella Hutton have shown every band in town what a heap of fantastic tunes can done. Never mind the pointless online hoods, these two really do let the music do the talking and their quirky shows take things off the beaten track. Their album launch in the Sandwich Co was one of the biggest gigs in the town this year and Blood play Gwyn’s Cafeacute in Brooke Park on Boxing Night, it’s an early one and doors are at .pm and there’s a strict .pm curfew, it’s a bring your own booze event and access is only through the Creggan Hill gate.Also, that night, Red Organ Serpent Sound play the Nerve Centre with Dirty Faces and Foreign Owl. This is the third home gig of the season for arguably one of the most exciting live acts around. Following up the rammed Nerve Centre reunion gig with a Bonfire Night Gasyard gig Red Organ Serpent Sound only do thing big, with every note designed to land directly in your face the five piece will again take the roof off the Nerve Centre. Following the release of their second album demos before their first album has been released has highlighted the fact that this is not a band that does the expected, live they’re something  altogether and you can expect…what did I tell you about expectation  Tickets are pound and probably won’t last.Anywhere  in the world Balkan gypsy folk music might seem a little out of place and the talents of the Balkan Alien Sound Orchestra might go unheard. In true Derry tradition they shortened the name and on Sunday, December , Basork will be playing upstairs in Tinney’s. They’ve had a single out this year and their Martyhas been over in Bulgaria showing themmins his stuff and letting them show him a thing or two, he’s a good egg like that. The band are launching their single at the oddest time of year but такъв е животът as they say in Bulgaria. They’ll be playing with Duozouk and Paul Brown will be playing tunes from all the corners of the globe, doors are at  and tickets are …. punts.I know I swore that that was it for the gigs and all, but Dutch Kills will also be coming out of semi-retirement for a secret special gig inside Bennigans, I’ll announce it next week. But that’s pretty much it. All the above will be peddling their wares and you’ll be able to pick yourself up a cd, record or t-shirt and support an artist for the year ahead. And THAT is the important lesson to learn this Christmas, not the redemption of Ebenezer Scrooge or George Bailey and the angels, no it’s that people who make their living from their art and music do it by being supported all year round. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town. While the post offices are important to our major towns, many are also at the heart of rural communities across the district.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after. This was the last time she was home..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Sophie.jpg","title":"Teenager Sophie fundraising for blind charity  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager has embarked upon a fundraising initiative on behalf of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.Sophie Millswill be selling raffle tickets for a host of prizes over the coming weeks ahead of a a key fundraising event in Ballynahinch Masonic Hall on February  next year.The Year  Ballynahinch High School student mdash who has been diagnosed with Albinism mdash is on the waiting list for a guide dog and has already been cane-trained by representatives from the charity.The teenager, who relies on the aid of her cane, is hoping that she will get her guide dog sometime next year, but is conscious that there is a long waiting list.Sophie, who recently finished in the top six of a SuperValu Superstars competition and was presented with a certicate during a glittering awards night at Belfastrsquos Titanic Hotel, is keen to help the Guide Dogs charity by raising money on its behalf.Her mum Marina said the estimated cost of training a guide dog is pound,.She explained: ldquoSophie wants to raise as much money as she can to help the charity which does not receive any government funding.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
