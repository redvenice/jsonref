She said the Speaker was making a laughing stock of Parliament.In the wake of his ruling, which came as a surprise to No 10, Mrs May told ministers: ‘The Speaker has framed this debate as Parliament versus the Government. But what it actually is now is Parliament versus the people.’A Cabinet source said: ‘The only thing agreed this morning was that everyone hates Bercow.’ The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said Mrs May had predicted a crisis if MPs rejected her deal for a second time, adding: ‘That situation has come to pass.’In other developments:Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, warned the EU would attach strict conditions to any delayBoris Johnson used face-to-face talks with Mrs May to warn her that he remains opposed to her dealAndrea Leadsom accused Cabinet Remainers of frustrating Brexit, and hinted she could quitUnconfirmed reports suggested the PM could make a final bid to get her deal through the Commons next Thursday – the day before Britain is due to leaveMrs May warned the Cabinet that if a long delay is agreed, the UK would have to hold elections to the European Parliament in MayDowning Street said there were no circumstances in which Mrs May would revoke Article 50Jeremy Corbyn and more than 100 MPs took time out from the Brexit crisis to attend the boozy British kebab awards in WestminsterMrs May’s efforts to win DUP backing for her withdrawal plan have stalled.Angela Merkel took a swipe at Mr Bercow, saying: ‘I’ll concede that I wasn’t actively aware of the British Parliament’s rules of procedure from the 17th century.’         An historic edition of the Daily Mail published with a sense of optimism for the road aheadMrs May told the Cabinet she would ask for an extension with a break clause that could allow the UK to leave the EU by June 30 if her withdrawal agreement is passed.But she acknowledged that, with no deal agreed, and the UK due to leave next week, she would also have to seek a longer extension.Ministers were not given the proposed end date of the longer extension, with allies of the PM apparently fearing a leak to the media.Downing Street denied reports that Mrs May was ready to ask for a delay lasting up to two years.Her deputy David Lidington is said to have told his EU counterparts that she would seek a delay of nine to 12 months unless she can get her deal through in the coming weeks. No 10 dismissed the report yesterday.But a Cabinet source said it was already clear that nine months would not be long enough because the new European Commission will not be in place until the autumn. ‘A nine-month extension is a joke,’ the source said. ‘There will be no one to talk to in Brussels until October – the idea we can get a new deal agreed in three months is ridiculous.‘All it means is we’ll have to go through this humiliating exercise again at Christmas. What is the point?’Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the UK would need to provide a ‘very persuasive plan’ to support any request for a long extension to the Article 50 negotiation process.Former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said both Parliament and the Government had to get a grip to prevent a slide into political chaos.

But Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson suggested the move would backfire, telling her: ‘Trust your instincts that a long extension would create ision in the party.’Mrs May’s plan was defeated by 230 votes in January and again by 149 votes last week.She had planned to put it to a vote again yesterday, but was blocked by Mr Bercow’s ruling that MPs should not be asked to vote again on the same proposition.Allies of the Prime Minister still believe it is possible that MPs could finally knuckle under next week.Her official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister is absolutely determined to find a way in which Parliament can vote to leave the EU with a deal.‘The PM wants that to happen as soon as possible.‘She does not want a long delay and believes that asking the British public to take part in European parliament elections three years after they have voted to leave would represent a failure by British politicians.’Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said there was a growing risk of no Brexit unless MPs agreed to back Mrs May’s deal in the coming days."},{"url":null,"title":"RICHARD KAY reveal ruthless effective regime Royal Buffness","story":"Share this article There is another hidden quality that has been every bit as critical: the satisfaction of a happy and settled domestic routine. Approaching his 14th wedding anniversary, the Prince of Wales is today as contented a figure as he has been at any time in his adult life.Three grandchildren and a fourth on the way have brought him an assuredness and sense of purpose.All of this is down to the other equally trim figure alongside him in Barbados — the Duchess of Cornwall. It is due to her influence that he allowed himself to venture on to a beach teeming with sun-worshippers in the first place.          Bachelor boy: Athletic Charles, 32, in the sea off Sydney three months before his 1981 wedding. Charles has always been a man who prides himself on his appearance              Heir to the tone: Aussie model Jane Priest steals a kiss from Charles when he was 30 (right) the 21-year-old Prince (left)The old Charles, a mass of insecurities, would have shrunk from such a public excursion. But in Camilla, he has found not just a soulmate, but someone who has made him shrug off such concerns.That they wandered on to the beach carrying their own towels and kicking off their shoes, just like the other holidaymakers all around them, was a sign of just how relaxed he has become.The couple were enjoying a brief lull in Barbados before resuming a 12-day tour that will see them become the first members of the Royal Family to visit the Communist island of Cuba.Despite the jokes that his ‘budgie-smuggling’ days were behind him, Charles has always been a man who prides himself on his appearance. And his secret appears to be simple — regular exercise, a moderate diet and a good dose of sheer willpower.He has always looked after himself and taken care of his body. He also enjoys physical activity and remains physically fit. He’s also very careful about what he eats. If he puts on any weight, he will make sure he loses it.         Fun times: Prince Charles having fun on royal yacht Britannia. Like his father Prince Philip, Charles is understood to undertake his own health and fitness routine, based on a Royal Canadian Air Force fitness regimen known as the 5BXLike his father Prince Philip, Charles is understood to undertake his own health and fitness routine, based on a Royal Canadian Air Force fitness regimen known as the 5BX (Five Basic Exercises).He is sufficiently motivated by the desire to continue to fit into military uniforms made for him 30 years ago without his tailor having to let them out. And walking, especially in Scotland, has become an essential part of his routine.‘His weight has remained pretty constant at around 11st 5lb for the past 40 years, though it does go up more often these days than it used to,’ says a friend.Exercise is only part of the story. Healthy and moderate eating — only two meals a day — is another. Naturally, his diet revolves around organic food and he has regular meat-free days. He also likes to fast from time to time, which helps to moderate his weight.Breakfast is usually soft-boiled eggs and fruit, and he never eats lunch. Dislikes include overcooked vegetables, coffee, chocolate, nuts, garlic, curry, chillies, raw onions, pork and blue cheese.Dinner is usually grilled meat or fish with fresh vegetables. Neither Charles nor Camilla has an especially sweet tooth, though the Prince has always been partial to treacle tart.Alcohol is also taken in moderation. Before dinner, he likes a dry martini mixed to his special recipe — three parts gin to one part vermouth — and he enjoys the occasional Laphroaig malt whisky and water.Of course, Charles has also enjoyed the good fortune of inheriting the genes of his remarkable father, whose astonishing vitality and good health is such that, earlier this year, he was able to crawl from his overturned car after an accident near Sandringham.After enjoying his time on the beach, Prince Charles was later more formally attired for a meeting with singer Lionel Richie, newly unveiled as a global ambassador for the international arm of his Prince’s Trust.Charles and Camilla will carry out some 50 engagements across Barbados, St Lucia, St Vincent and The Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis, Grenada, the Cayman Islands — and, of course, that historic visit to Cuba.   Hello…is it ONE, you’re looking for?

Photograph: iStockHolders of UK driving licences who have applied to swap them for Irish permits due to Brexit have been told they must stay off the road possibly for weeks while awaiting new licences.There are thousands of UK licence holders in Ireland, who have been advised to change their licences as they will be invalid in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Fianna Fáil transport spokesman Robert Troy said the Road Safety Authority (RSA) confirmed to him a demand of up to 500 applications per day was being seen.Amid backlogs caused by a rush of applications for licence exchange, drivers are being told by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) that it is illegal for them to drive until they get their new permits.In correspondence to an affected driver seen by The , a senior NDLS official states: “We would advise that you should not drive while the exchange application is in processing and should wait until you have your Irish driver’s licence physically in your possession.”When holders of a UK licence exchange their permit for its Irish equivalent, they surrender the British version at the driving test centre. They are given a receipt for the new licence, but according to correspondence seen by this newspaper, this is not sufficient to allow them to drive.“It is a legal requirement that when driving in Ireland, the driver must be in possession of a valid driving licence for the class of vehicle driven. A receipt issued by an NDLS Centre states the applicant has applied for a licence but does not grant the bearer permission to drive,” an official told an applicant.Under pressureEmails sent to applicants also show that the turnaround time for licence exchanges slowed down as the system came under pressure. “Please be advised that due to an increase in volume of foreign licence exchanges, an application to exchange a UK licence can take up to 30 working days,” one email from March 12th reads.Those caught up in the process have expressed dismay at being told they could be off the road for more than a month, with fears that public holidays around Easter could further slow down processing times. The NDLS has already been forced to open some centres for additional opening hours, and give priority to UK exchange licences.“If I can’t drive to work, it would add an hour to my commute each day as the public transport route isn’t great,” said one person who is exchanging their licence. The person, who has returned to live in the State after spending some years in the UK, said any delay would also have a significant effect on their personal life. “One of the big advantages of living at home again is being able to see family more often.”“They seriously need to come up with some sort of ‘grandfathering’ rule to at least cover us while we wait,” the person saidThe Road Safety Authority confirmed in response to a parliamentary question from Mr Troy last week that the National Driver Licence System has seen an increase in applications to exchange driving licences from the UK and that daily demand was now at 500 applications per day.“In the event that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement in place, the driving license of a UK licence holder living here in Ireland will not be recognised and the driver will not be able to continue to drive in Ireland on that licence,” said chief executive Moyagh Murdock.In recent times the average processing time for a UK licence exchange has been 17 days, but following an increase in resources from the RSA, waiting times were down to 7.5 days as of March 12th, Ms Murdock added, in her letter dated March 13th.Irish exportersSeparately, former minister for finance Michael Noonan has said he is confident Irish exporters will be “able to cope” under a no-deal Brexit.He was speaking in his native Limerick where he officially cut the ribbon on the €17.6 million Gardens International development.Mr Noonan said uncertainty was “bad for business, bad for investment, and bad for trade”.However, he believed exporters could “ride out” a no-deal, adding that Ireland should not be too concerned about Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Paul FaithGetty ImagesThe Government has an open mind on whether the European Union should grant a long or short extension of article 50 to the UK at this week’s summit, according to sources involved in high-level discussions on the subject.Ministers will discuss Brexit preparations on Wednesday when the Cabinet meets at Government Buildings in advance of this week’s crucial summit in Brussels, which will conclude just a week before the UK is due to leave the EU.With the British prime minister Theresa May expected to seek an extension of the article 50 process for leaving, EU council president Donald Tusk – who chairs the EU’s highest decision-making body comprising of the heads of all 28 governments – visited Dublin on Tuesday to meet with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for talks on Brexit.SolidarityIn a statement, the Government’s spokesman said Mr Tusk “expressed the strong and ongoing solidarity with Ireland of the European Council and European leaders”.“They agreed that we must now see what proposals emerge from London in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday.“Meanwhile, preparations continue in Ireland and across the European Union for a no deal scenario, which would have serious consequences for all concerned,” the statement concluded.Neither leader took questions from the media as they entered the meeting and officials were tight-lipped about the men’s discussions. However, senior sources said that there was not yet a fixed view in Government about whether Mrs May should be granted a short extension to potentially get her deal through parliament, or a long extension – which Brexiteers fear could threaten the UK’s exit from the bloc.One source suggested the British could be granted a short extension with an option to extend, but also they could leave as soon as the withdrawal treaty was ratified, perhaps in the coming weeks.However, another senior figure speculated that the European Council could delay a decision on an extension by a few days in order to see how matters at Westminster play out – placing huge pressure on the British government and the House of Commons to pass Mrs May’s deal, but also risking a no-deal outcome.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

There\u0027s a reason its rivals have opted to take their regulatory medicine. It really isn’t doing itself any favours by engaging in a fight like this.\u0026nbspAnother problem with the attention that has been given to the company, and its business practices, is that it’s rather detracted form the other important points the committee has made about live music, which makes a hugely important contribution to the UK’s cultural and its economic life.\u0026nbspIt is an industry that employs 28,000 people, and generated almost £1n in terms of gross value added in 2017, a year in which 29.1m people attended concerns and festivals in the UK.\u0026nbspLooked at in those terms, it is a stunning success. But all is not rosy in its garden and its problems go far beyond people buying tickets from secondary websites and getting fleeced.\u0026nbspThe report highlights numerous issues. Venues have been closing, especially smaller ones. The way in which the benefits of live music are shared around the country is distinctly uneven. In terms of gross spend, for example, the North East generated £51m, compared to £194m in the Midlands, compared to more than £1bn in London.\u0026nbspDespite this the capital has fewer arenas per person than do other major cities and one witnessed stated that it is “trending down” with respect to its international rivals.\u0026nbspThe industry is dogged by competition issues and conflicts of interests that Tom Gray, from the band Gomez, pointed out “would not be tolerated in any other industry”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above the growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker – productivity –\u0026nbspis falling.”If a fall in productivity – the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour –\u0026nbspwas to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefiting from earning a wage,” he said.\u0026nbsp“By backing the\u0026nbspgovernment’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightIn recent years,\u0026nbspeven music has\u0026nbspfailed to revive MySpace\u0027s popularity, and the cost of storing the files inevitably led to suspicions that the loss of data may not have been entirely accidental.MySpace\u0027s admission of losing 12 years\u0027 worth of music uploads following a server migration is uncomfortable reading for anyone responsible for data, Barney Taylor, managing director of Cloud IT firm Ensono Europe, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspMigrating data from one server to another is always a nail-biting exercise. Even the simplest migration can run into hurdles and the consequences for the business can be severe, hampering customer experience, reputation and ultimately revenue.Facebook at 15: How Mark Zuckerberg took over the internetData migration is sometimes the only option, according to Mr Taylor, in order for a business to catch up with the rapid advancement of technology, though was unable to point to the exact reason for the migration.It has led some to question MySpace\u0027s public narrative, with some suggesting the lost music is the result of trying to get rid of the cost of hosting the files.I\u0027m deeply\u0026nbspskeptical\u0026nbspthis was an accident, Andy Baio, the former chief technology officer of Kickstarter, tweeted. Flagrant incompetence may be bad PR but it still sounds better than \u0027we can\u0027t be bothered with the effort and cost of migrating and hosting 50 million old MP3s\u0027.MySpace did not respond to a request for comment from\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspto give further details about how the music went missing.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It follows Kit (Larson), a twenty-something dreamer who receives an invitation that will fulfill her childhood dreams.Created with Sketch.Hidden gems: The best Netflix originals you might have missed Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.It’s also a big month for the classics as Ridley Scott epic Gladiator and Steven Spielberg’s original Jurassic Park trilogy will all be available to stream.You can find the full list of every movie and TV show joining Netflix below.Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: Part 2\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPart 2 finds Sabrina exploring her darker side, curious to learn more about her heritage, while struggling to maintain her friendships in the mortal world.

The odds remain small but not insignificant – around one-tenth of 1 per cent.Only slightly wider than the height of the Empire State Building, Bennu is not big enough to destroy Earth but could cause huge destruction.Its size makes it the smallest body to ever be orbited by a spacecraft, Nasa said.Studying Bennu with Osiris-Rex will allow researchers to learn more about the origins of our solar system, the sources of water and organic molecules on Earth, and the hazards and resources in near-Earth space, the space agency said.Nasa\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphost\u0026nbspa media conference at 5.30pm GMT to announce further details about the agency\u0027s mission to return the spacecraft to Earth.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But has it made a no-deal exit from the European Union\u0026nbspmore likely?Several Tory Eurosceptics think so, as does Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader who is setting up a new Brexit Party.They welcomed the speaker’s edict, hoping that denying May a third vote means the UK could still leave without a deal at 11pm on 29 March.True,\u0026nbspthis currently remains\u0026nbspthe legal default position, as set out in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 – and it can be changed only by new legislation. With time running out,\u0026nbspBercow’s decision does mean\u0026nbspthat May has even less of it at her disposal.However, the Eurosceptics are clutching at a very thin straw. Even if Bercow blocked May’s attempt to hold another vote on her deal by 29 March, that would not prevent her rushing through secondary legislation to delay the exit date. She intends to use a statutory instrument, which would require approval by both the Commons and House of Lords after a 90-minute debate.Created with Sketch.Dogs rallied in Brexit protest  Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of protesters gathered with their dogs for the \u0027Brexit is a Dog\u0027s Dinner\u0027 rally near Parliament in Westminster on Sunday 10 March 2019.

Last week, MPs rejected a no-deal departure by 321-278, and voted 412-202 to extend the two-year Article 50 process. It\u0026nbspwould be odd for the government to ignore these votes.In the unlikely event it tried, backbenchers would take matters into their own hands.May admits country ‘in crisis’ with 10 days to avert no-deal BrexitThe nuclear option would be to collapse May’s government, with Tory MPs opposed to a no-deal exit backing a no-confidence motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn – as some Tories have threatened to do. Then a caretaker administration would have to respect the will of MPs and avoid no deal.Ironically, the Eurosceptics’ best hope of securing a clean break on 29 March now lies with the 27 other EU members, who must unanimously approve an Article 50 extension. If they decided not to do so, and instead\u0026nbspcut the UK loose, the only way the government could avoid no deal\u0026nbspwould be by revoking its decision to leave the EU, which it could do\u0026nbspunilaterally.May has made clear she would never do this, and it is doubtful whether a majority of MPs would support the idea. However, the signs are that EU leaders will agree to a delay at their summit on Thursday and Friday, as they do not want to be blamed for a chaotic no-deal exit.Strangely, Bercow’s ruling was welcomed by pro-EU as well as Eurosceptic MPs. They can’t both be right. MPs who want a Final Say referendum or a Norway-style deal\u0026nbspbelieve the speaker has made a long extension more likely, and are probably right.There is another reason why Eurosceptics could be disappointed – Bercow himself. His explosive intervention suggests he would help MPs find a way to stop a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspif he needed to.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

time to avoid it. But we need to change our attitudes to wasting water,” said Sir James.The Environment Agency chief is set to deliver this message at a speech to the Waterwise conference in London.Stop flushing Yorkshire puddings down the toilet, water company pleadsBesides significant action by the government, water companies and regulators, Sir James is warning that the public must also play a role in tackling this growing threat.“In the last few decades we’ve radically changed behaviour on smoking (everybody did it) and seatbelts (nobody wore them). In the last two years we’ve changed behaviour on plastic,” he will say.“We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea.“We need everyone to take responsibility for their own water usage.”The Environment Agency previously warned that water shortages may affect people by 2050, and the government has suggested efforts must be made to cut people’s water use.However, an official report also found that enough water to meet the needs of 20 million people in an average day is lost through leakages in the system.Preventing these leaks, as well as larger reservoirs and desalination plants, were all suggested by Sir James as\u0026nbspmethods to prevent the impending catastrophe.We’ll tell you what’s true.

There needs to be a new event or a new political process.”A longer extension needs to be linked to something new. There needs to be a new event or a new political processMr Barnier told a news conference in Brussels: “It is our duty to ask whether this extension would be useful because an extension will be something which would extend uncertainty, and uncertainty costs.”He again warned that the UK would need to propose “something new” to justify a lengthy extension.A “new event” can only really mean giving the British public a Final Say referendum or an election, while a new process is likely to refer to a push to rewrite Ms May’s strategy\u0026nbspto include a closer relationship with the EU, possibly a permanent customs union.The Independent understands that for these things the EU could potentially agree a nine month delay, or a three month delay if Ms May sought a shorter extension to the Article 50 period.Barnier: ‘Everyone should now finalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario’Mr Barnier’s words were later backed up by Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney who said the UK would have to table a “a new plan of action, potentially a new approach” that has a majority in the Commons.He added: “I don’t think there’s any appetite amongst leaders to simply kick this can down the road.”May admits country ‘in crisis’ with 10 days to avert no-deal BrexitBrexit delays will make the UK a pariah for global investorsBut any move to secure a long extension by Ms May, without the option of a get out, will enflame tensions in her own party.A hardcore group of Brexiteers have indicated they could even side with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour in a vote of no confidence in Ms May’s administration is she delays Brexit for too long. \u0026nbspDetails of discussions from the morning cabinet meeting were again widely leaked, with angry comments made by Brexiteer ministers.Andrea Leadsom told colleagues: “This used to be the cabinet that would deliver Brexit and now from what I’m hearing it’s not.”Liz Truss, who gave an interview at the weekend indicating that she might be tempted to run for the leadership, warned that a failure to deliver Brexit would mean the UK becomes “a barren land ruled by Jeremy Corbyn”.International trade secretary\u0026nbspLiam Fox\u0026nbspwarned all leadership hopefuls that if their party cannot secure a deal it could be destroyed.Labour said Mr Corbyn had held “positive and detailed” discussions with members of the “Norway-plus” group of MPs on Tuesday afternoon, who are seeking a relationship in which the UK remains in the single market and customs union.A spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “All participants pledged to work together and with others across parliament to find a Commons majority for a close economic relationship with the EU to break the Brexit impasse and bring the country together.”Mr Corbyn\u0026nbspalso held talks with leaders of small parties who are united in calling for a new referendum with a Remain option.Green co-leader Caroline Lucas said afterwards that progress was “slow”, but added: “He certainly didn’t rule out the idea of a public vote.“He did say he would have some real concerns about putting Theresa May’s deal to the public vote, a deal that has been lost twice here in parliament, and he would be much happier putting his own version of Brexit to that public vote.“That’s something certainly we’re going to continue to talk about going forward.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

We need something new because if it’s an extension to remain in the same deadlock, how do we get out of this? The British have to come with an initiative that is clear and credible and supported by a majority,” the French minister told reporters on her way into a meeting of ministers in Brussels.Arriving at the same\u0026nbspmeeting, Mr Roth added: “We’re really exhausted by these negotiations and\u0026nbspI expect clear and\u0026nbspprecise proposals of UK government\u0026nbspwhy an extension is necessary. It’s not just a game. It’s an extremely serious situation not just for people in UK but also for the people in EU.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?“For my government it’s the key priority to prevent a no-deal Brexit. I don’t have any appetite for substanceless, very abstract discussions and negotiations on Brexit. Please deliver, dear friends in London, please deliver. The clock is ticking.”Ms May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet with the 27 other EU leaders, after parliament approved an extension to Article 50 – which would delay Brexit past 29 March. Under EU treaties, such\u0026nbspan extension must be approved unanimously by all 27 other member states – meaning each one has an effective power of veto.Speaking on Tuesday after meeting EU27 ministers, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said leaders would have to assess what is in the best interests of the bloc before making a decision.“I am here to ask a very legitimate question on behalf of the European authorities –\u0026nbspwhich is why do you want an extension? What for? What’s the objective of an extension? What use would it be? An extension has to be useful,” he said.“Does an extension increase the chances of ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?”Barnier speaking in Brussels after the meeting (EbS)He added: “What would be the purpose and outcome? And how can we ensure that, at the end of a possible extension, we are not back in the same situation as today?”Mr Barnier warned that “extending uncertainty without a clear plan” would have political and economic costs for the EU, and that a longer extension needed to be linked to something – such as a new political process in the UK to find a solution to the deadlock.Also speaking after the meeting, Ireland’s deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said there was “a lot of concern amongst EU member states and partners about the prospect of a long extension of Article 50”.“An extension brings risks with it, obviously through a European election cycle and the establishment of a new commission, and the EU is dealing with a lot of things at the moment,\u0026nbspso the disruptive effect of Brexit for another nine months, or another whatever period of time, is something that I think people will need convincing on,” he said.Mr Coveney added that “there will need to be a very persuasive plan to go with that, to explain why that’s needed, and how they will use the time to conclude the outstanding issues that haven’t been agreed in London in the context of the Brexit process”.He warned that an extension would not necessarily be accepted: “I think people would be very foolish to assume that this is just some kind of political game and that an extension will automatically be facilitated. I do think EU leaders will be demanding.“The EU does not want to grant an extension on request for the UK that brings us back to the same point that we are at today, in three months, six months, nine months’ time, having wasted a lot more time”.The comments by the French, German\u0026nbspand Irish ministers are the latest expression of frustration from EU leaders at Britain’s approach to talks, which is seen in Brussels and elsewhere on the continent as erratic, poorly planned and ided.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Dogs rallied in Brexit protest  Show all 60Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hundreds of protesters gathered with their dogs for the \u0027Brexit is a Dog\u0027s Dinner\u0027 rally near Parliament in Westminster on Sunday 10 March 2019.

On Sunday Ms Loiseau\u0026nbspjoked in an interview with the French press that she had nicknamed her pet cat “Brexit” because of the way in which it meowed loudly to leave the house but then stood there when she opened the door.If the UK does not get an extension it will either have to pass the Brexit deal, revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit, or leave without a deal – with the latter option expected to cause economic chaos.\u0026nbspTheresa May has been criticised previously by EU leaders for turning up to meetings in Brussels without clear and precise technical demands. At a summit in December Ms May was reportedly asked, “what exactly is it that you want?” by German chancellor Angela Merkel, while she pleaded for assistance to pass her Brexit deal, but could not spell out exactly what measures she wanted.We’ll tell you what’s true.

fresh referendum supporters delighted - while minister floats extraordinary plan to suspend parliament and start a new sessionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May’s hopes of forcing MPs to back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

surrenders in reference to the likelihood of Brexit being delayed after the vote Experts pointed to a possible precedent from 1948, when Attlee’s Labour government prorogued parliament for a new 12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayPolice surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester Conservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve Bray“I think that the prime minister and parliament should promote a sense of parliament establishing what there is a big majority for.”More than 70 MPs\u0026nbsphave already signed the amendment - including Nicholas Soames, Nick Boles, Antoinette Sandbach, Dominic Grieve and Caroline Spelman\u0026nbsp- with the aim of a day of debate next Wednesday, ahead of votes soon after.The move, and a blizzard of other amendments, threatens the prime minister with further defeats – one day after her humiliation over the no-deal veto.The Independent Group hopes to push for a new referendum, with the option to Remain, but cannot succeed unless the vast majority of Labour MPs support it.The Labour frontbench has sent out mixed signals in the last 24 hours – Jeremy Corbyn’s aide backtracking, while Keir Starmer, his Brexit secretary, said he was “proud” to be backing a further referendum.EU open to a \u0027long\u0027 Brexit delay, Donald Tusk saysHowever, a Tory amendment, with 13 Labour supporters says a public vote “would be isive and expensive, and therefore should not take place”.Labour’s own amendment does not address the controversy, simply urging the prime minister “to provide parliamentary time for this House to find a majority for a different approach”.Meanwhile, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, applied gentle pressure on Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, to clarify his legal advice, in the hope of winning over opponents to the deal.Talks are ongoing with the Democratic Unionist Party in the hope of persuading the party that – despite Mr Cox’s devastating advice this week – there is an escape route from the Irish backstop.The European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers appears split, some ready to get behind the deal while Steve Baker, its vice-chairman, said “come what may, we will continue to vote down this deal”.Mr Hammond said Mr Cox’s advice was “clearly very important”, adding: “I\u0027m sure the attorney-general will want to consider very carefully all the evidence and opinion.”The chancellor said he was “certain” MPs will vote for an Article 50 extension later, with the prime minister warning delay until about June will only be possible if her deal passes by next Wednesday.Otherwise, she told MPs, EU leaders will insist on a much longer extension – and the UK would have to take part in May’s European Parliament elections.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Indeed, annual employment growth of 1.6 per cent\u0026nbspis above the growth in the economy of 1.4 per cent, implying that output per worker – productivity –\u0026nbspis falling.”If a fall in productivity – the amount of goods and services workers produce per hour –\u0026nbspwas to be confirmed, it would imply less positive news is to come on wages.In the long term wages can only continue to increase sustainably if productivity increases.Minister of state for employment, Alok Sharma, hailed the figures. “Our jobs market remains resilient as we see more people than ever before benefiting from earning a wage,” he said.\u0026nbsp“By backing the\u0026nbspgovernment’s Brexit deal and giving certainty to business, MPs have the chance to safeguard this jobs track record.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This led other cities across Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, to develop tactile paving in the following years.Seiichi Miyake\u0026nbspinvented tactile paving, also known as tenji blocksHowever, it was not until the 1990s that Miyake’s invention became commonplace in western countries such as the UK, US and Canada.The most common types of tactile paving include raised lines or domes. The former design indicates that it is safe to walk on a particular path, while the latter acts as a ‘stop’ sign to alert users to potential dangers.Created with Sketch.

One man is seen kicking the boy while he is on the ground. On Sunday, the prime minister Scott Morrison told reporters: “The full force of the law should be applied to Senator Anning.” Victoria Police has said it is investigating the actions of the senator and his supporters as well as those of the teenager.One of those who tackled the boy was far-right activist Neil Erikson, who was controlling access to the building. During the scuffle to apprehend the boy, he shouted for reporters to be removed from the area. “Get the journalists out of here ... If you don’t like, get out,” Erikson said, according to The Sun-Herald newspaper. While the child was being held in a chokehold, one of Mr Anning’s supporters is heard telling him: “You are nothing but a weak human f***ing being, you f***ing prick.”New Zealand attacker’s gun club was reported to police, man claimsDeath toll from New Zealand terror attacks rises to 50Egg a day may increase heart attack risk, study saysThe teenager has won considerable support for egging the far-right senator. A crowd-funding page set up to help pay for any legal fees he may face has raised almost 30,000 Australian dollars (£16,000). The page initially said: “Money raised will go to EggBoi for: Legal fees. More eggs.”But it was later updated to say the 17-year-old “is committed to sending a majority of the money to the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.”In a video posted after the egging incident the boy urged people not to follow his example. “Don’t egg politicians. You get tackled by 30 bogans at the same time,” he said in the video, using Australian slang for an unsophisticated person. “I learnt the hard way,” he added. Mr Anning caused outrage after the attack in which 50 Muslims were killed in two mosques, with a statement calling Islam “the religious equivalent of fascism”.He said: “The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place.“Let us be clear, while Muslims may have been the victims today, usually they are the perpetrators. World-wide, Muslims are killing people in the name of their faith on an industrial scale.”He added: “The truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”A Change.org petition to remove him from parliament has accrued almost a million signatures and has made it the biggest and fastest-growing petition ever hosted on the platform.

I got my two best friends to record me reading a scene from the movie and we stupidly decided to do it after a bottle of wine for Dutch courage.When I sent my audition tapes through I sounded more Irish than American and I missed out on a potentially huge role.I just wish I had put my mind to it more, but I didn’t really have an interest in acting back then.Kelly Rohrbach got the lead and looked amazing in it. The film wasn’t actually that great . . . but it would have been pretty cool to work alongside Zac Efron and The Rock.SET the controls for the best day of my childhood – Saturday July , , a glorious day of sunshine and showers when England won the FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany.Every second of it is etched in my mind – Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore’s golden aura and Kenneth Wolstenholme’s commentary.“There are people on the pitch – they think it’s all over – it is now!”It was a day to make you believe in magic.I watched it, aged , with my mum – my dad worked every weekend – and I squeaked “F***” when the Germans equalised to make it - at the end of normal time.It was the only time in my le that I ever said “F***” in front of my mum.She forgave me immediately “as it’s the Germans,” she said, the Blitz still fresh in her memory after  years – and went to put the kettle on as we settled down for extra time.It was a day of excitement, pride, patriotism, passion and pure, undiluted drama.WHEN I was a kid I wanted to be an astronautand also an RAF fighter pilot.I was lucky enough to be taken up in a Phantom jet in September , when I helped launch the annual air show at RAF Leuchars, in Fe.Awesome is an overused word, but not in this case.I was given training, poured into a G-suit and for the next hour I had the thrill ride of a letime.Obviously I did nothing but sit there enthralled while not touching any important buttons.We pulled three Gs, which was a bit like being cuddled by a gorilla, but women withstand G-Force better than men and, unlike Jeremy Clarkson, I managed not to throw up.At one point I was upside down and flying so fast I felt I had left my body behind.I wish I could go back in time to relive that moment again and again.I HAVE done a lot of really stupid things – often on purpose. When I told my mum I was leaving college to join a band she told me not to be stupid. But that actually worked out OK.For sure I’ve taken plenty of bad advice over the years and committed countless, colossal clangers.If I could go back in time I absolutely would but not to sort out any of my messes.I’d like to make something that was totally brilliant even more mind-blowingly brilliant than it was to start with.It would be to the summer of . I’d just got my new racing bike. That bike was my first true taste of freedom.I spent the whole summer tearing all over Dorset with my two best friends.I’m not sure anyone ever felt quite as free in the moment as that -year-old boy racing a new bike down a massive hill as fast as possible in the sunshine.There’s no way I’d let my kids do it now. Far too many cars on the road. But I can remember exactly how it felt, clear as anything. Woo-hoo.I WOULD go back to the autumn of , when I was living in New York.My flatmate was in real estate and he had got wind of an apartment building, jointly owned by the residents, that had gone bankrupt.He said you could now buy two-bedroom apartments in this building for as little as ,. It was a risk, sinceit didn’t come out of bankruptcy I’d lose everything.But the upside was thatit came out of bankruptcy, the flat would immediately multiply in value. He was going to buy one. Did I want to buy the one next door I owned a flat in London and could have drawn down on my mortgage to borrow the money.I ummed and ahhed about it and, eventually, chickened out. You can probably guess the rest.My flatmate bought an apartment for ,, the building’s finances were restored and it’s now worth .million.I would like nothing more than to use a time machine to buy the flat next door. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

England’s finest  More like a full English.”Or as Merson put it: “If I looked like Brad Pitt, I wouldn’t be here.”For their first game Harry lined up his former Lions against Ridgeway Rangers Youth, a side of  year olds.After a lot of huffing and puffing on the pitch Harry’s side, which has a combined weight of  stone, hardly cover themselves in glory.The lose - and are so out of shape Harry halts the game before full time.Redknapp said: “It can’t get any f*****g worse, can it ”It might have been a disaster on the pitch but the viewers loved it - and the second episode airs tonight as they take-on Germany.One wrote: This is looking like a winner.

Maybe nobody is.“The whole thing is a national humiliation on a scale we have not seen in many, many decades -ever before.”Meanwhile, Remain ministers predicted Jacob Rees-Mogg’s -strong European Research Group would just seize on a shorter delay to run down the clock for a No Deal exit on June .Yesterday’s  minute long Cabinet bust up came as Mrs May’s top table tried but failed to agree aand reason for the Brexit delay.One of the revolt’s leaders, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, told the Mrs May directly: “Trust your instincts Prime Minister. A long term extension would create ision in the party”.Others to speak out against a long delay were Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and International Trade chief Liam Fox, who have both already signalled they may resign rather than vote for the her original plan.They were also joined by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, Treasury Secretary Liz Truss, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom and Tory chairman Brandon Lewis.In a seething attack on the Cabinet’s Remainers, Brexiteer Ms Leadsom told the room: “This used to be the cabinet that would deliver Brexit and now from what I’m hearing it’s not”.Mr Lewis also told the meeting thata long delay forced Britain to hold European Parliament elections on May  – at a cost of at least £m – the Tory party would “never be forgiven” by Leave voters.The Sun has also learned that senior ERG figures have drawn up a fresh list of demands to issue to the PM to improve her Brexit deal in exchange for their support.No and EU chiefs have insisted the Withdrawal Agreement is now closed after final tweaks won by the PM last week.But around  ERG members are still insisting the Irish backstop must be made escapable, and they want Mrs May to press for that at tomorrow’s EU summit.A senior ERG figure said: “All the PM needs to do to get our support is show some balls and issue our terms to the EU.“They do not want No Deal and they will blink first, but she refuses to ask them”.Chancellor Philip Hammond argued for a longer delay, along with Justice Secretary David Gauke and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd.But the PM eventually summed up the meeting by telling the Cabinet its majority view was for a short delay.Later Mr Hammond tried to paper over the bust up by saying: “People have dferent approaches to how we should do this, but we are all clear we want to get this done as soon as we possibly can.“We want the shortest delay possible, but what we need to get is an extension that allows us to get the deal through Parliament.”During Cabinet, Trade Secretary Liam Fox also issued a powerful attack on Tory leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson, who are still refusing to back the PM’s deal, saying: “You’ll be left with a crown without a kingdom”.The PM asked to see Boris in No yesterday in a bid to persuade him round, but both remained tight-lipped on exactly what they discussed.Admitting the UK was now in crisis, the PM’s official spokesman said: “The PM saidMPs didn’t support the Meaningful Vote there would be a crisis.“Events of yesterday tell you that situation has come to pass.”The PM despatched her de facto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, to Brussels yesterday to try to explain the chaos in the Commons to key Brussels figures.He outlined the PM’s initial position that Britain wants a technical extension of up to the end of Junethe deal passes, but a much longer oneit fails.As the pressure on all MPs intensied, one Labour MP went public to declare he would could back the PM’s deala no-deal Brexit was the only other option.Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell told BBC Radio ’s PM: “If there is no alternative to voting for her deal, then I can see myself voting for it. I haven’t made my mind up on that”.The PM’s official spokesman yesterday said that Theresa May still believes the deal she has secured with Brussels is “a good one and the best deal available”.But he confirmed that from Monday, Parliament would be able to begin to “determine a way forward” in a Commons debate under a promise made to MPs before the second Meaningful Vote a week ago.Then, de-facto deputy PM David Lidington vowed MPs would get an opportunity to vote on the way forward on March the Government lost.Insiders believe MPs are almost certain to push for a series of “indicative votes” on other Brexit options. Pressedthe Government could re-table the PM’s deal as one of those, the PM’s spokesman said: “We haven’t set out any process.”DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds last night said the Ulster unionist party’s conditions for backing the PM’s deal “haven’t softened”.And he said that while there had been “good” discussions with the Government - they were not yet ready to offer support.Sources claimed the DUP were not ready to commit until they knew Theresa May had enough support in the bag to win a Meaningful Vote.As Government turmoil over how to pass the PM’s deal deepened, it emerged last night that one extraordinary plan is to hold the third and final Meaningful Vote as late as March  - just  hours before the UK is due to leave.The last minute brinkmanship move would give MPs no other option to avoid a No Deal Brexit than to back Mrs May’s agreement.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would finish her”.Boris Johnson faced a bitter backlash from supporters on Monday by declaring he will vote down the PM’s orce agreement unless the EU agrees to more changes.One ally minister branded the former Foreign Secretary “deluded”.While winning favour with the Eurosceptic party membership, his continuing defiance will further alienate Tory MPs who pick the final two candidates for a nationwide party vote, the ally warned, adding: “He is crap at politics. He will end up outside the two”.Another Tory Brexiteer MP said: “Boris seems to be forgetting that many of our members are councillors, and they face a wipe out on May we’re still in the EU for years.“That will not engender him to them.”A WhatsApp group for Tory Brexiteers was re on Monday with speculation that the PM will next week accept a bid by Labour MP Peter Kyle to hold a second referendum on her deal as a way out of her galling dilemma.Maria Caulfield warned on it: “Moderates are being tempted by Kyle et al as they don’t believe ERG will ever accept anything but WTO”.ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg went public with his jitters over continuing to vote down Mrs May’s deal on Monday.The Tory MP for Somerset North said: “No deal is better than a bad deal, but a bad deal is better than remaining in the European Union, in the hierarchy of worst options.“The debate is really, is No Deal still realistic ”Mrs May told at least one MP that her controversial chief Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins will “go as soon as the deal is through” in a bid to curry favour – but civil service pals insisted he wanted to move on anyway.Putting a brave face on the mess, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there were “cautious signs for encouragement”.One hardline Brexiteer said he’d told the Prime Minister on the phone that there was no chance of him backing her deal this week.He said: “I think she rang me as a last ditch effort. I told Stephen Parkinson I won’t budge on it when he arranged the phone call yesterday. I think she rang me as a last ditch effort. I’m not going to change my mind and I reiterated that in conversation - and told her a lot of other people are going to do that.

You can have the same motion but where the circumstances have changed.Other options he discussed to make the motion dferent were attaching the Article  extension to it, or some changes on Northern Ireland guarantees that are being thrashed out with the DUP at the moment, he suggested.Last night Westminster was ided on what the latest dramatic turn meant for Brexit.Brexiteer James Gray told Newsnight: “It’s my view that this ruling by Mr Speaker Bercow will mean that Britain will not now leave the European Union at all.Veteran Tory backbencher Alec Shelbrooke accused the Speaker - who has admitted he voted Remain - of trying to kill Brexit.Today the PMs spokesperson said that Britain was essentially now in crisis over the deadlock.They admitted: If you look back at the speech the PM gave just before MV, thatMPs don’t support MV we would be in crisis, I think events yesterday tell you that has come to pass.The little known precedent — used just  times, the last in  — bans the Government from asking MPs to vote on the same motion more than once in a parliamentary session.It was drawn up after King James interfered in the Sherf of Buckinghamshire’s election — by demanding a second vote, so his candidate could be elected.Mr Bercow, whose we had a B****cks to Brexit sticker on her car, wants to use the delay to try and keep us in the EU, other critics argued.Meanwhile Remainers in Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP pushing for a People’s Vote lavished praise on the Speaker.A Government source said: “It seems clear that the Speaker’s motive here is to rule out a Meaningful Vote this week, which also stands in the way of securing a shorter extension.“It leads you to believe what he really wants is a longer extension, where Parliament will take over the process and force a softer form of Brexit.“But anyone who thinks that this makes no deal more likely is mistaken — the Speaker wouldn’t have done itit did.”The PM is set to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to Article  this week.Shell demand a short extensionshe gets the deal through in the coming days, but could be forced into a long one of monthsshe doesnt.After Speaker Bercows bombshell intervention that the PM cant bring back the same vote to the Commons again, it was rumoured that the Government could ask the Queen to end the current Parliamentary session and start a new one.Theres a rule which means the same motion can only be voted on once in each Parliament.If its dferent, ora new session is started, then it can come back for a new vote.But this morning Stephen Barclay vowed to keep the Royals out of it.He told Sky: One thing I think everyone would agree on is involving Her Majesty is not the right option.And he insisted that the best way for MPs to end the Brexit impasse is to vote for the current deal and get it through. Meanwhile, hardline Tories threatened to go on strikethe PM carries out her vow to delay Brexit by a year.As many as  members of the European Research Group have told whips they will carry out “vote strikes” - a move that would push Mrs May’s minority government to the verge of collapse.As Conservative tensions over Brexit reached boiling point around the PM’s ultimatum strategy, one senior Tory backbencher told The Sun: “If she tried to go ahead with a long extension, there will be vote strikes on all Government legislation."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004769238291.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow brexit bbc interview","story":"The Commons Speaker made a string of sarcastic jokes when he was approached by the BBC this morning.He ignored repeated questions about his controversial move to stop Theresa May holding a third vote on his Brexit deal.Mr Bercow was filmed walking to work in Parliament and asked: Can you explain to the public what you did yesterday But instead of responding, he said, I really feel you ought to get yourselves some coffee or tea - then made a joke about the reporters hat.Pressed on the issue, the Speaker sneered: Im sure people are so very grateful to you for showing such interest at this time in the morning - very grateful to you, very well done.As the camera crew crossed the road with him, Mr Bercow snapped: Careful, careful! There are cars coming along here, Im not going to sacrice myself for your benefit.I know that you attach great weight to what you think, but perhaps youd be kind enough to allow me to proceed.Yesterday the Speaker, who has near-total control over the Commons, cited a -year-old precedent which stops MPs from tabling the same questions again and again.Mr Bercow said the rule prevented the PM from bringing her Brexit deal back for a third meaningful vote after it was defeated twice.His edict was welcomed by hardline Brexiteers keen to go for No Deal - but also by Remainers who want to overturn Brexit entirely.Tory MP James Gray today predicted the Speakers move would kill off our EU exit for good.He said: As a result of Mr Bercows ruling yesterday there will be a huge extension to A over the weekend, No Deal is off the table.My suspicion is that this is the end of Brexit - I dont think that Britain will leave the European Union.Despite Mr Bercows gambit, the PMs officials today vowed to defy him and hold a third vote on the deal as soon as next week.No believes they can overrule the Speaker by attaching small tweaks to the existing deal, or by holding a vote of the Commons giving the PM permission to table her deal again."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004752902521-e1552690961362.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may begging eu brexit deal","story":"If Theresa May can on Tuesday win the vote on her Brexit deal at the third time of asking, then the road ahead will become much clearer.Butshe loses again, this country’s future will — to an uncomfortable extent — be in the hands of the European Union.The DUP, with its ten MPs, will be key to what happens.If the Government can satisfy them, then Mrs May has a chance of winning the vote because of the domino effect them coming across will set off.If she can’t, she — as No aides admit — might as well not bother holding one.The DUP spent yesterday in intensive talks with senior Government figures. I under­stand these talks were broadly positive. One Cabinet minister close to the process tells me the chances of the DUP backing the deal are, “a bit better than :. I’d put it at :”.What is winning round the DUP is the promise of putting into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which puts the deal into UK law, a requirement that there be no ergence between Northern Ireland and Britain.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be so-called superior legislation. This would mean it would trump any other bill, giving the DUP some reassurance that the next Prime Minister couldn’t let regulatory dferences emerge between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland.Parliament will also be given a scrutiny power over the backstop, allowing it to vote every few years on how it is operating.At the same time, the UK Government will seek to offer the DUP some reassurance about this country’s ability to get out of the backstop. I am told thatAttorney General Geoffrey Cox’s legal advice had been dferent, then the DUP would have been on board this week. One Cabinet minister tells me:“Geoffrey did cost the DUP.”To sweeten the deal for the DUP, there will be money and ladles of respect. The DUP want a new “policy package” to replace their confidence and supply deal with the Tories which runs out in June.To say that these negotiations are delicate would be an understatement. I am told, “ people put too much pressure on them, there’s a danger that they’ll bolt”.But with this Speaker and this Parliament any hopes for a better one, or for a clean break, seem for the birds.As James Forsyth says, the “big beasts” of the backbenches must show some leadership.Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith were leading lights of the Leave campaign, but by not backing the deal they are now imperilling the whole project. They won’t be forgiven.Good card players know when to hold ’em and know when to fold ’em.Wise politicians must be no dferent.Butthe Government can get the DUP, it is confident that Jacob Rees-Mogg will then come on board.Despite voting against the deal on Tuesday, European Research Group chairman Rees-Mogg left himself a ladder to climb down, repeat­edly declaring that the only reason to vote for this deal wasBrexit was in genuine danger.After the Commons voted against No Deal and for an extension, it clearly is.The big question is how many Brexiteer rebels climb down Jacob’s ladder. Downing Street think there are  to  Tory diehards who won’t vote for the deal even with the DUP on board.The precise number is absolutely crucial. As one senior Downing Street source explains: “If it is at the lower end of that scale, it can be made up with Labour. If it is at the higher end, it can’t be.”There are, I’m told, between  and  Labour MPs prepared to back a deal but onlyit has a realistic chance of passing. Influential figures in the Cabinet are urging No to make the vote on Tuesday a free vote, to make it easier for Labour MPs to support it.If the deal doesn’t pass on Tuesday, then Mrs May will have to go to the European Council on Thursday and beg for a full-on extension to the Article  process. I am told she is dreading this personal and national humiliation.The Commons should spare her and, more importantly, the country, that.RIGHT now there is little sign that either Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab are going to move and back the Brexit deal.Both feel that their reservations about it are still too strong.But there is a danger for them both –  Tory Eurosceptics voted against the deal on Tuesday night.Whatever happens with the DUP, that number will drop a bit when the meaningful vote comes back for a third time.The danger for Boris and Raab is thatthey walk through the lobbies with this shrinking group, they will start to be seen as purely factional candidates, and purely factional candidates rarely win leadership contests.Already some of those who backed Boris last time and had been planning to do so again are peeling away.Now is a moment that calls for bigness.If either Boris or Raab were prepared to say that – despite their reservations – they were going to try to get the deal over the line, because Brexit is only going to get softer otherwise, they would show they have the selflessness necessary to lead.WHEN your voice is going, what’s the last thing that you want  A meeting with a heavy smoker.But that is what Theresa May had to contend with on Monday after she flew to Strasbourg for last-minute talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.By Wednesday, Mrs May’s voice was so bad that No had a plan for Andrea Leadsom,  to take over halfway through PMQsher voice gave out completely.TO get people to do things you need both a carrot and a stick.But the problem for the Government is that its warnings to Brexiteer rebels are all stick.It is pointing out that Brexit will only get softerMPs don’t vote for the deal. This is right, but these MPs need a positive inducement too.One Tory who carries messages from Theresa May’s Downing Street to the Brexiteer rebels tells me: “If she offered to go, she would get very close and possibly do it.“It unlocks those people whose self-perception is that they don’t give in to blackmail.” This source continues: “If the DUP move, Jacobmoves,Jacob moves others follow, but you don’t quite get there without the carrot.”Mrs May could leave with dignity, having secured an orderly Brexit and having managed to avoid a split in the Tory party.She wouldn’t need to leave the next day, either.But just in time to ensure that a new Prime Minister had their feet firmly under the desk before a new European Commission comes into office this autumn.One reason why an indication that May will go is so important is that there is assumption she will try to staythe withdrawal agreement passes.One Cabinet minister tells me: “If she gets a deal through, she won’t be able to resist clinging on.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But instead of giving up, there are easy ways to improve your memory. Mark Channon is one of the first Grand Masters of Memoryand worked with Joey Essex, Gok Wan and Valerie Singleton in a new C programme, Can I Improve My Memory     He gives them genius tips on how to remember quickly and by the end of the show puts them to the test in front of a live audience. Here, Markshares his unforgettable tips on strengthening our power of recall. . Get interested It sounds obvious, butyou are really interested when you meet someone, read a book or listen to someone talk, the more likely you are to learn and remember.Ask yourself, what’s interesting about this  Immediately you paymore attention.. Be OK with forgetting things When people get anxious about the things they forget then it’s more likely their memory will fail. Start to be OK with not remembering where you left your keys – they’re not important things to get stressed about. The more relaxed you are, the more you remember.  . Get creative Start to involve your visual and spatial memory. Make a memory palace by imagining images working up your body. For instance, imagine you have Gladiator swords in your feet, a squidgy brain between your knees, dancing girls on your thighs, a golden ring on your behind. And imagine one million dollars wrapped around your waist.It’s easy to remember these weird images because it’s visual and hard to get out of your head. Each image is a trigger for a memory. What you’ve memorised there are the best picturewinners from the Oscars  to  – Gladiator, A Beautul Mind, Chicago, Lord of the Rings and Million Dollar Baby.. Practise recalling Once you’ve read a book, think, “What are the five things to remember from that ” This method is the opposite of reading things over and over again. If you practise recalling, you’re recreating a memory and in your brain the connections are getting stronger. That’s why practising retrieving, or recalling, is a good technique. Soyou condense a lot of information to bullet points, close your eyes and try to remember them – realise which point you forgot and practise again to really make things stick.    . Exercise If you exercise, you’re creating new neurones and connections in your brain. Likewise, when you sleep it’s like a cleanse. If you’re not doing either well, that will have a impact on your brain especially as you get older and wear and tear sets in. . Learn new things It doesn’t need to be anything crazy – read a new book, or go out more in a new social situation, which is the perfect opportunity to make an effort to remember people. As you learn new information, you make new connections in your brain. . Make improving your memory a new habit Try little things every day. If you memorise five things to do every morning by creating a story or imagining pictures, after a couple of weeks it will become a habit. Then it will start to show up in your day. Maybe you’ll be in a meeting and instead of writing five things down, you’ll memorise them. It primes you and raises your attention.    . Meditate Just for three minutes, focus on one thing. Most people have  things flying around their head. We become less good at just doing one thing at a time. It sharpens focus. . Associate people’s names with pictures Sometimes when you’re introduced to someone, you’re thinking about what you’re going to say. Practise focusing on them and listening at a deep level – how are they feeling  What are they thinking  That way you will remember more about them. Listen attentively. To remember their name, create a picture in your mind. So for a person called Julie, I would imagine a jewel on their face. Don’t share the image with them. . Train yourself to remember small things Forgetting your car keys, wallet or even where you’ve parked your car happens because we’re not paying attention. So create a good habit. Imagine after you’ve put the key down it starts dancing. The more ridiculous the better. Then do a little celebration – a little fist bump. The first few times you do that consciously, then after around three days, it will happen automatically. By then, when you put your keys down you might not imagine them dancing but you’ll pay more attention to where you left them. Can I Improve my Memory, Channel , March .

There were fears Leave MPs could quit over her expected formal request to ­Brussels on Wednesday for an extension that could keep us in the EU until June at the earliest or even up to two years. One raging minister said after a “spiky” Cabinet meeting on the matter: “I couldn’t back a long delay. She’d have to sack me.” It came as Downing St finally admitted the Brexit shambles was a “crisis”.And Mrs May slipped closer to being toppled as fed-up Leavers believe any y delay would kill her fading authority.    Some eurosceptics hoped an offer of a long extension would lead to a no-deal. But No  insiders insisted Parliament would block us crashing out. Other Brexiteers are worried a delay could lead to a soft exit, or none at all.With a hardcore of up to  Brexiteers, the PM would have to rely on Labour votes to get her deal through. This could erode her authority so terminally she would have to go. That puts hardline Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab in prime position to succeed her. One source said the rattled PM told the Cabinet: “If we don’t deliver Brexit people will never forgive us. We’re a laughing stock.” But the EU’s Michel Barnier warned Mrs May there was no ­guarantee a delay would be granted unless there is “clarity” over why she wants one.    The PM is expected to ask for a long extension, with a possible Brexit in May or Juneshe gets her already rejected deal through. But Mr Barnier said: “You said both short and long. Well, it’s either one or the other, isn’t it ” The EU may even demand a second referendum to get a delay. Eurosceptic Tories have launched a secret bid to persuade EU chiefs to veto any extension to Brexit at a Brussels summit this week, it has been reported.

The Muslim Council of Britain made the furious allegation tonight after the party took action against a string of members following complaints online. Members were suspended after three separate dossiers on multiple alleged cases of Islamophobic or offensive comments were assembled by online activists in the last two weeks. After the first dossier was presented, it is understood  people were identied as Conservative Party members and suspended pending investigation. However, following the last two dossiers, the party has not specied how many of those accused have been suspended. Instead, Tory chiefs simply say an unspecied number of people who were identied as Conservative Party members and made offensive comments were suspended pending further investigation.    A Muslim Council of Britain spokesman told the Mirror: It appears that the Conservative Party has been caught trying to cover up who it decides not to suspend and the reasons why. “This is the latest in a long line of incidents that have led to a total breakdown of trust in [Tory chairman] Brandon Lewisapos personal handling of this crisis. There needs to be an independent inquiry to shine a light on this issue. Anything less is just not good enough.The dossiers of alleged cases were compiled by the @MatesJacob Twitter account and the Red Roar blog and highlighted by BuzzFeed News. They come party from an unofficial Jacob Rees-Mogg supportersapos group on Facebook that Tory chiefs stress is in no way affiliated with the Conservative Party, containing many non-Conservative members. In the first incident on March , it is understood  Tory members were suspended after comments by dozens of people were highlighted online by @MatesJacob.   One person had called for Muslims to be banned from working in the emergency services, while another described Muslims as “Mussies” and called for Britain to “get rid of all mosques”. In the second incident on March , @MatesJacob tweeted a further  alleged cases - including one person who claimed there were Muslims coming in from up country to steal dogs and it will be us whites who will suffer in years to come.The next day, the Mirror contacted Conservative HQ to askany of them had been suspended.We received a reply saying: Where people who have made offensive posts have been highlighted and identied as party members, they have been immediately suspended, pending further investigation. However, despite a follow-up request, the party did not specy how many of the  people had been suspended. In the third incident earlier this week, The Red Roar blog published details of  more people it accused of offensive posts. They included someone who shared a petition which accused foreign citizens of trying to change the UK into a Muslim country and another who shared a video titled Muslim horde swamps English town. Again, Conservative chiefs said action has been taken and Party members who have been found to have made inappropriate comments have been suspended pending further investigation.”However, BuzzFeed News - which presented the most recent two groups of allegations to the party - said Tory chiefs had refused to specy how many people were suspended.Former Tory party chair Sayeeda Warsi told the website: The system of complaints is opaque and mired in bureaucracy. There is no clarity on which complaint has been considered, what action was taken and no transparency of eventual outcome. This is what makes this issue of Islamophobia institutional - the party as an organisation is failing those that raise concerns. The Mirror contacted Tory HQ this morning asking for clarity on how many members had been suspended following the most recent two dossiers - containing  allegations. Despite several follow-up calls, we did not receive a reply by pm.

She started the clock to our exit with no idea of what she wanted then spent most of that two years pandering to her hardline no-dealers. It produced an incompetent negotiating strategy that has made us a laughing stock. With Parliament paralysed, No’s ­description of May’s mess as a crisis is an early contender for understatement of the year. Crashing out on Friday week would be a far greater catastrophe for us than for the EU. So Europe’s worst poker player has left chief negotiator Michel Barnier with all the best cards. The Brextension could be three months, two years or longer. Whatever the delay, surely time has run out for the PM.    Our death duty With our ageing population this country must begin serious consideration of what is the right way to support people in the last months and years of their lives. A  per cent rise in Brits signing up for assisted dying clinics abroad over the past four years shows just how worried people are about living their final days in pain. And yet many believe changing the law here could put people at risk and lead to a slippery slope of judgments about what a le is worth. What is not in doubt is that it is time for a national conversation on how we care best for those in sickness and insufferable pain. And on that most dficult of subjects: death. Best revenge... The cash-strapped NHS rationing operations is a painful result of Tory austerity. Behind every delay or denied treatment in the shocking statistics is a person who should vow to get even with the Tories in the polling booth at the next election.

And the -year-old feared she would have to give up her beloved hairdressing career because he skin wouldnapost stop racking, weeping and bleeding. But then one of Francescaaposs customers suggested a cheap baby moisturiser and within just two weeks she saw a miraculous change.    Francesca, of Brigg, North Lincolnshire, said: “My skin ended up so raw that even water would burn like hell. Washing up, having a shower or having my hands in water all day was agony. “I love my job, but I was in that much pain that every time I came home, Iaposd have to smother my hands in steroid cream and wrap them in a bandage, then wear cotton gloves to help it absorb quicker. “My confidence was at an all time low, too. I felt disgusting and diseased. “But now, le has completely changed for me. I still can’t quite believe itaposs all thanks to a £. moisturiser for babies.” Francesca, who has a son, Charlie, six, with her steel worker husband Chris, , told how the first signs of dermatitis sprang up around five years ago when she started itching between her fingers.  At first she thought little of it, assuming it was simply a reaction to exposing her hands to water and chemicals, like those in hair dye, at work. But over the ensuring three weeks her symptoms worsened - with over-the-counter products making no dference. So, after consulting her GP,  she was referred to a dermatologist at Lincolnshireaposs Scunthorpe General Hospital. “I was prescribed a steroid cream, which worked for a while, but then my skin almost got used to it and the symptoms flared up again,” she said. “So, I was given a dferent type of steroid cream, which I’d apply every night and bandage up my hands to keep the moisture in. “But it soon stopped working again and we were back at square one. That rigmarole of going back and forth carried on for years.”  At her lowest ebb, Francesca even had daily sessions of phototherapy, which involves using UV light to treat a range of skin conditions. It made no dference. Eventually, doctors warned her thatthey could not find something soon to alleviate her symptoms she would have to consider quitting her hairdressing career. Francesca said: I’d been a hairdresser for  years, so I couldn’t just walk away. There had to be something out there that could help.” Meanwhile, as time wore on with no sign of her symptoms improving, Francesca’s self-esteem was in tatters. She said: “I was so self-conscious of my hands. Doing hair meant I couldn’t even cover them up. “If I ever went out, I’d wear a cardigan or jacket I could shove my hands in the pocket of.  “I remember paying for something one day when the cashier demanded to know what was wrong with my hands. I left the shop in tears. “I’m sure she didn’t mean for it to sound nasty, but when you already feel down, a comment like that makes you paranoid that everyone is staring at you.” At the end of her tether Francesca feared she may never find anything to help. Then everything changed last yearwhen a client suggested she tried Childs Farm, a British skincare brand that uses naturally derived ingredients and essential oils.

Detective Constable Rebecca Bryant, , knew Lauren Jones as her sonaposs girlfriend and sent messages to the juror telling her to keep quiet about the connection. Bryant, a family liaison officer to victim Lynford Brewsteraposs family, even offered Miss Jones lts to the court One text from the detective read: Don’t tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think I’ve told u about it although u know I haven’t xxx. Her lies cost the taxpayer at least £, - as a retrial into the killers was ordered by the Court of Appeal.    Bryant sat with murder victimaposs family in the courtroom as Miss Jones was just yards away on the jury bench. Dwayne Edgar, , Jake Whelan, , and Robert Lainsbury, , were convicted in December  of murder in the cold-blooded killing - and sentenced to le in prison. But all three had their convictions quashed after the relationship between the detective and juror was later discovered. A Court of Appeal judgement said: Several weeks after the trial an appellant’s solicitor received information that a police officer providing family liaison, Detective Constable Bryant, who had attended court during the trial to provide support to the deceased’s family, had a close relationship with a member of the jury. That officer’s son was in a long-term relationship with the juror.    There was recovered from the officer’s phone a series of texts which the pair had exchanged at that time which are highly material in this appeal. “It is clear that the officer initially lied about having any relationship with Ms Jones, although she subsequently admitted contacts with her in interview.” The Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and Edgar, Whelan and Lainsbury were ordered to have a retrial. The texts from Bryant were uncovered after an investigation was launched by the CPS. The messages from the South Wales Police detective read: The Murder trial is put back til st. Not that that matters cos they’ll hold u til thenthey need to. “Remember what I sed though, as long as you don’t know any of the witnesses that’s fine.... I won’t be there hardly and I’m not a witness anyway so that ok u don’t need to worry bout that.    “Don’t tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think I’ve told u about it although u know I haven’t xxx.” One message also offered Miss Jones a lt to court: If ur on the murder ul be finished same time as me most days u can have a lt to mine afterwardsu wanted x.” Jones replied, saying: “Fab thanks! The bus is a nightmare x.” The probe found Miss Jones also worked with victim Mr Brewsteraposs sister. The judgement said: She said nothing about her connection to the sister of the deceased. At one point she did say something to the effect that she was a teacher at the school but went no further than that. She appears to have followed the advice given in the first text mentioned.” The police officer also failed to say anything to anybody although she was aware that the juror was sitting on the murder trial.”  The three were convicted for a second time after a seven-week trial at Bristol Crown Court which ended this week. They will be sentenced later this month for the murder of Mr Brewster in Cardf in June . Father-of-three Mr Brewster was stabbed to death with a hunting kne in “callous, cold-blooded” killing in broad daylight during a row with drugs dealer Whelan. South Wales Police said Detective Constable Bryant had not committed any criminal offences but she would be investigated by the forceaposs internal disciplinary body.    Assistant Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: When issues regarding the original trial came to light, the matter was voluntarily referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and has been investigated by the South Wales Police Professional Standards Department. “Our investigation, which has also been subject of independent review, has not found any evidence that the officer intended to undermine the criminal justice process, and following a formal submission to the Crown Prosecution Service the matter will now be dealt with through South Wales Police disciplinary processes. “Our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Brewster who we have continued to support throughout this dficult time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum tearfully admits watering down","story":"NewsMum tearfully admits to watering down babys formula to make it last longerAfter bills, mum-of-two Hayley has £ a month to live onShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video mum-waters-down-babys-formula-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor a number of reasons, over half of mums in the UK will formula feed their babies. Hayley is one such mum who relies on infant formula to feed her nine-month-old. However, given the cost of formula, a tearful Hayley revealed she has been forced to water it down to ensure it lasts longer. Hayley had tried to breastfeed her babies, but they didnapost take to it. The heartbreaking admission was made to Kate Quilton on Channel aposs Dispatches: The Great Formula Milk Scandal. Whataposs even more troubling about Hayleyaposs situation is that she is by no means alone - experts are worried that watering down formula will become increasingly common.    Hayleyaposs partner earns £, a month, with £ spoken for on bills, which leaves £ which they have to really stretch and be careful with. Some days I just wouldnapost eat. I would let my girls eat, she said. Itaposs heartbreaking to see your baby cry because you canapost afford her milk. She was starving. When asked how she made the formula last, Hayley revealed she added extra water, saying: I just have to make it stretch... Itaposs horrendous. According to the study in the Channel  programme, £. will buy you enough Sainsburyaposs Little Ones formula to last six months.  If you spent the same amount on SMA Pro First Formula, youaposd only get a . month supply. As the most expensive brand, £. worth of Aptamil Profutura Stage  would last . months. The cruel irony is that experts have confirmed all formula brands contain the same essential nutrients, yet the disparity in pricing is huge. Hospitals store formula for new mums who canapost breastfeed, but arenapost allowed to recommend a specic brand. Disturbingly, some healthcare professionals attend training days which are sponsored by certain formula brands.  Itaposs something which Dr Laura de Rooy, a consultant neonatologist at St Georgeaposs Hospital, agreed is not necessarily providing those healthcare professionals with unbiased information. Professor Anthony Costello, a former director at WHO, said: It’s outrageous. If you’re a company and you want to promote your products, you want to reach the people who are most influential. So that will be paediatricians, it will be dietitians, it will be nurses, midwives, health visitors – companies are now right in the NHS , and that is extremely worrying. More worrying, it’s almost co-branding themselves with the NHS and they’re essentially advertising their products, it’s quite confusing for the health workers.  The British Specialist Nutrition Association, a body which represents formula milk brands, said in response: We believe we have a responsibility to provide informationso that they can advise parents about feeding their babies. We are only allowed to make legally approved claims and we believe it is irresponsible to suggest to parents and carers that they cannot trust these. However, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care, said: Parents have a right to accurate, unbiased advice from healthcare professionals and it is completely unacceptable for health care providers or workers to receive financial incentives of any kind to endorse particular brands.

The heir to the throne, who turned  last November, took a break from his hectic schedule on the Caribbean island to cool off in crystal clear blue sea.  Former military man Charles is renowned for being very active, having served in both the navy and air force and trained as a jet pilot maintaining an incredible level of fitness.  He is also an avid polo player, goes on regular hikes, and has a regular fitness regimen.   The Prince has been known to do push-ups and crunches before bed and was even recorded asking the National Welsh Rugby team for training advice, to help him be even more fit.    Camilla, who is , also looked incredibly fit in an aqua-blue one-piece swimsuit with onlookers saying the royal couple “looked very happy together”.  The royal couple are undertaking more than  engagements, covering six countries and one overseas territory including a historic trip to Cuba over the next  days at the behest of the Foreign Office.  The highlight of their trip is a four-day tour of Cuba beginning on March  - the first by members of the monarchy.  One onlooker at the public beach in Barbados said: “Charles looked absolutely incredible. He has a physique of a very fit man less than half his age.    “He is testament to living a healthy and actively lestyle.” The images have drawn comparisons with infamous pictures of Charles from  when Jane Priest, a glamorous Perth model became a global sensation after famously ambushing him in the surf at Cottesloe Beach in front of the world’s media.

He made the joke last November as he was given a tour of the new facilities at the police station in King’s Lynn, Norfolk. The heir maintains a strict diet, revealed in an interview for his th birthday, which revealed his eating habits are more like an eccentric retired Colonel’s than King Henry VIII’s.  It all starts with breakfast when Charles sits down to an egg boiled for exactly four minutes.  With that, he has a cup of Darjeeling tea with milk and honey.   The Prince always skips lunch but almost always has some form of game for his supper.  Indicating a borderline obsession with the small game birds, Charles has also claimed to have invented a version of moussaka using grouse - calling it “groussaka”.

Hannah Tittensor, , from Belfast, says she first became addicted to having a tan after ing from a holiday to turkey in . The beauty therapist loved the transformation from her paler skin to a dark tan so much, she decided to start having sunbeds and regular top-up injections. The aposunder-the-counterapos jabs include a substance called Melanotan, which users take to go darker more quickly under sunlight or sun beds. And while Hannah admits she is at the “extreme end’, she says she is part of a growing trend in tanning in Belfast, with many using the illegal drug.    Despite side effects that include feeling sick, her boyfriend Ben Dunlop, , also uses the injections. “Everyone is doing it,” said Hannah. “It’s become a trend in the city.” “I use the sun bed for about fteen minutes, three times a week. “Ben and I do the injections for about one week each month, where you have an injection before you go on the sun bed each time. “I just use the injections to top me up for that week, and then I stay really tanned all month. “I absolutely love the colour I go and much prefer this than spray or fake tan that’s smelly and makes you feel dirty. And it gets all over your clothes and bed.”Like many, Hannah regularly posts photos of herself on social media and has been using Instagram since , before she became hooked on tanning.   But when she uploaded the first photo of herself on the  holiday in Turkey - when she revealed her new ultra-dark skin for the first time - she started to get hate messages and online abuse. “I had an amazing tan but I felt like dying,” she said. “People told me I looked like an alien, that I looked ugly,” she said. “Some people accused me of trying to look like a black woman. I’m not trying to do that at all, I just like the way my skin looks healthy and glowing with a tan. “Some girls can’t live without getting their nails or hair done and for me its tanning. “I’m always playing around with my look . I’ve been a skater girl, sometimes had more of a surfer hippy look, and now I like to look like this.” In January , when Hannah combined her new skin colour with box braids - a type of hair braiding more commonly worn by African and African-American people - she received a fresh waves of attacks. “People were commenting on my photos accusing me of cultural appropriation and even saying that I was racist, just because of how I looked,” she said.    “I’m not racist at all. I’m just a white girl who likes to be overly-tanned. “It seems like I am the worst person in the world just for tanning sometimes. It seems to offend people sometimes and I’m not trying to. It seems pretty harmless to me. “Every girl I see on instagram is tanned. I know I’m at the extreme end but I like the way I look. I feel like me.” Hannah says she first found out about tanning injections when her brother Jack tried them in . “He came in one day and was suddenly really tanned,” she said. “We asked how he did it and he said it was Melanotan.” Trainee barber Ben has been using sun beds since he was  and has now been taking tanning injections for three to four years. He keeps fit with bodybuilding and regularly goes with Hannah to the local gym, where the couple like keep in shape.    Melanotan is widely promoted on bodybuilding websites and forums, aimed at bodybuilders who want to enhance the effect of the way their muscles look with deeper tans. “Bodybuilding has gotten really popular in Belfast, and so have the tanning injections with it,” said Ben. “I don’t compete in bodybuilding or go on stage, I just like to work out and feel healthy. Tanning is a big part of bodybuilding. A lot of bodybuilders take tanning injections. “My mum thinks I look like an idiot but I don’t care, I like it. “I worry about Hannah sometimes because cancer runs her family, and she goes into the sun bed for longer than me usually. I normally do  minutes while she does longer. “I don’t have a history of cancer in my family so I don’t really worry about myself. I don’t know much about the side effects of the injections.”   Users of Melanotan are able to buy it through Facebook groups and some beauty salons and gyms.The vial is mixed with water and injected under the skin. Hannah and Ben take around iu dosage each time they use it. “The injection doesn’t hurt,” she said. “You just feel a bit sick and lose your appetite for a couple of days.” The substance is created in a lab and increases the levels of a natural pigment in the skin called melanin, which responds to sunlight and causes darker skin, hair and eyes. Increasing it in your body using tanning injections allows your skin to go darker under the ultravioletlight of the sun or a sun bed. The UK National Health Servicewarns people on its website against using Melanotan, saying it is not legal because it has not been tested and approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .    Because it is injected and users might share needles, other concerns about Melanotan include the spread of HIV and other blood-borne diseases like hepatitis or infections from injecting non-sterilised water. Despite the other health risks of too much sunlight or sun beds, Hannah is not ready to quit tanning. “One of the main reasons I do it is I don’t need to wear much makeup,” she said. Tanned skin looks better and it saves me lots of time going out or to work. “I’m not going to go any darker at the moment but I probably will in the summer, and that will spark off all the abuse again. “But it’s OK, we’re kind of used to it now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stupid family clambers 1000 tonnes","story":"NewsStupid family clambers on , tonnes of fallen rock below clfVisitors at West Bay, Dorset, spoke of their horror at seeing the family with young kids ignore warnings for people to stay awayShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  MAR NewsThe man and woman ignored warning signs urging people to stay away from the face of the perilous clfs \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email This is the shocking moment a family risk their lives as they play on a huge pile of rocks under fragile clfs.The couple ignored warning signs urging visitors at West Bay, Dorset, to stay away from the perilous clfs and let their children clamber up the , tonnes mountain of rock.

In  there were  British people signed up to Le Circle and Dignitas, meaning the  figures show a .% rise.    It has been estimated by the Assisted Dying Coalition that at least  Brits will be members of a third clinic, Ex International. It has not responded to requests for numbers. The figures come as the results of a Royal College of Physicians poll of its , members on whether assisted dying should be made legal here are due out within days. Pro-assisted dying campaigners believe the rising UK numbers reveal just how many terminally ill Britons are desperate for the right to end their lives. Tom Davies, of Dignity in Dying, which wants a change to UK law, said: “The fact that membership of Swiss assisted dying organisations is on the rise is further proof the law in the UK is not fit for purpose. “Clearly a great many people feel the options available at the end of le are not enough to ensure a good death and a growing number are prepared to take matters into their own hands. “By denying people choice and control over their deaths in this country we are simply outsourcing death to Switzerland and forcing families to shoulder the cost.”    And he is critical that some clients may be forced to travel before they are ready to die, and at a cost of in excess of £,. He said: “A good death should not be restricted to those who can afford it, know their way around the system, are able to travel or have families willing to break the law.” Last year  Brits ended their lives in Switzerland at Dignitas and Le Circle. Dignity in Dying estimates a Brit takes their le there every eight days. Under the  Suicide Act, anyone helping or encouraging someone to take their le could face up to  years in prison. At least  people have been probed after taking family members to Swiss assisted suicide clinics, but none has been charged. Tom Beagley-Spicer, , who travelled to Dignitas with his mother Susan Spicer, , three years ago, said the fear of ­investigation never goes away. She ended her le in Zurich after losing her mobility and sight because of multiple sclerosis. He said: “It scared the le out of me. The day Mum died, Dignitas said, ‘You should move hotels in case anything happens.’ From the minute Mum died, the fear tripled. “Landing back in the UK, each bit of passport control, customs and arrivals, my stress levels were so high.” Tom, of Fleet, Hants, has felt unable to grieve fully because he has not been able to talk openly of his mum’s death. He also reveals that to find the £, to cover her clinic fees and travel, his mum, who had been forced to retire in her s, needed to take out a high rate loan. Tom said: “Whereas death isn’t pickyyou are rich or poor, a trip to Dignitas is.” A Mirror survey last year showed % of Brits would back a change in the law to allow assisted dying. But campaign group Care Not Killing, which is opposed to assisted suicide and euthanasia, said: “If someone is suicidal, they need support. “Independent evidence shows the majority end their lives because they feel they have become a care burden. The alternative is very clear – fund ­palliative care.”To find out more visit dignityindying.org.uk or carenotkilling.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"untold story girl 17 who","story":"NewsUntold story of girl, , who saved entire village from being massacred by NazisGabriella Ezra, now , saved her fellow villagers from almost certain execution after they were imprisoned in a cowshed by Nazi soldiersShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  MAR NewsGabriella in her native Venice just after the war \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The extraordinary story of a fearless teenage girl who saved an entire village from being executed by the Nazis has come to light  years later.Gabriella Ezra, , who lives in Brighton, East Sussex, intervened to stop her father Luigi and  other inhabitants of a village in her native Italy from being massacred by a firing squad. She has now finally been awarded a prestigious Star of Italy medal after her son Mark wrote to the Italian embassy to make officials aware of his motheraposs heroic actions on the morning April , . Gabriella, who was  at the time, chased after a German officer and pleaded with him to show mercy to the villagers of Capella di Scorze, near Venice, who had been rounded up and locked in a cowshed. The Germans were after retribution following an attack on their men by Italian partisans which had left several of them wounded. They had previously executed  men in a neighbouring town following partisan action, with these prisoners set to suffer the same fate.  Gabriella, who spoke immaculate German as her family had lived in Austria, was taken by the officer to speak to his commander. She lied about the villagers having no knowledge of the ambush and was told that she would also be shotthe Germans discovered the truth. Luckily, the villagers had buried their partisan armbands and all the prisoners were released, with the German commander telling them they owned their lives to Gabriella. The very next day the Germans fled the village which was liberated by the Allies.  After the war Gabriella met and married British army officer Captain Peter Ezra and moved to Britain to start a family with him. Her son Mark, , a documentary maker, recently wrote a letter to the Italian embassy to tell his motheraposs extraordinary tale. His letter was read by the ambassador and he subsequently presented her with the Star of Italy, awarded to British and Commonwealth forces who served in the Italian Campaign from  to .  He said: If my mother had not intervened they would all have been killed. She showed such remarkable courage. My weaposs sister saw a newspaper article about another woman who received an award from the Italian government and I thought my mother deserved the same recognition. I wrote to the embassy and my mother was invited to receive the Star of Italy. She was understandably delighted. The whole family was at the ceremony and we had a fabulous time. The local partisans had forewarned the people of Capella di Scorze about the attack on the Germans and advised them to close their shutters in case their windows shattered. Afterwards the Germans arrived and rounded up  men, prompting Gabriellaaposs brave intervention.  The retired language school teacher, said: I remember there was a knock on the door from a young Italian man who told us to close our windows as the partisans were going to attack the Germans. We were terried as when the partisans had attacked the Germans in another village they responded by hanging all the men in the square. The partisans did attack as they said they would and the Germans wanted reprisals so they rounded up the men in the village including my father and locked them in a cowshed. I told my mother I had to do something so I ran after the officer and pleaded with him that these men were just farmers who cared about their fields and cows. He took me to the commandant and I begged him not to kill them, telling him again and again these men were innocent.  They took me outside and lined up the men with a firing squad and said this woman tells me you are innocent. If sheaposs lying Iaposll kill you all, her first. They searched the men but they had hidden their partisan armbands in the cowshed. The men were led away and my father passed me his watch and a note to my mother because he didnapost think he would survive. But the commandant then ordered for them to be set free sayingthere were any more attacks he would destroy the village. Early the next morning we heard an engine and thought the Germans had come back. But it was actually a British soldier who was there to liberate us and he just wanted someone to rustle him up some breakfast! When the British came we cried tears of joy and embraced them. It was such a relief. Gabriella met Capt Ezra, of the Middlesex Regiment, while working as a translator in the town majoraposs office in Mestre outside of Venice in .  He had taken part in the North African and Sicily Campaigns before participating in the Battle of Anzio and moving northwards. They married in Venice in  and they moved to Hove, where she worked as a language coach. She was greeted as a hero when she first ed to the village  years ago, with a meal laid out on the square in her honour She said: I was showing my daughter around the village when a man spotted me and said aposoh my goodness itaposs Gabriellaapos. They made a meal for me in the square. They said they were very pleased to see me because I had saved the village. Capt Ezra died in  and Gabriella has two children, Mark and Diana.

I started coming up with ideas for my wedding dress about two or three years ago.

I think knowing Dean was the one helped me finish finalising my dress design. It’s like it made the fairytale dream come true. I knew he was the kind of guy I wanted to be with eight years ago. He’s the sweetest guy, kindest heart, would do anything for everyone and knows how to always put a smile on my face - and he calls me princess.

Dr Donald Cline told patients seeking articial insemination he would source “fresh sperm” from medical students.But he actually used his own in procedures on dozens of unwitting women in Indiana, US, in the s and s.The -year-old’s appalling betrayal of trust only emerged when Jacoba Ballard, who knew from an early age that she was conceived using a sperm donor, began searching for any half-siblings and turned to commercial DNA testing. She only expected to find a few and after her hunt led to Cline admitting what he had done, she said: “I feel like our mothers were violated.”    Liz White, , who had her son Matt after Cline inseminated her over five months in , said: “I feel like I was raped  times.” She remembered how his office was filled with pictures of babies he had helped conceive – a detail she said did not strike her at the time but she now finds deeply unsettling. Cline, who retired in , got a one-year suspended sentence in  after admitting two counts of obstructing justice. No other charges were filed as Indiana law does not explicitly ban fertility doctors using their own sperm. Jacoba, , began searching for half-siblings sharing her donor in . Using an online forum for adoptees and donor-conceived people, she found a woman linked to Cline. And as soon as she saw her photo, she knew they were related.    That woman connected her with another one whose mother also used Cline – and had a sister. The four of them decided to take DNA tests with andMe, which confirmed they were related – and also revealed four further half-siblings were on the database. Cline had told his patients he used each donor for only three successful pregnancies. But they now had proof one was used in at least eight. The birth years also ranged from  to  – and medical students, which he said he used, only do three-year residencies. After further investigating and testing, the number of matches grew. Heather Woock, , was stunned when she was contacted through her ancestry account, set up when her husband got her a DNA test as a gt because of her interest in genealogy.    When a group of half-siblings, including Jacoba, finally met Cline, he confessed to using his own sperm. At the time of his trial, he apologised “for the pain my actions caused” – although he did not specy how many times he had done it. But court documents from Marion County in Indiana reveal he told Jacoba he had used his own sperm about  times. Many of his children have formed close bonds and Jacoba said: “We feel cheated we didn’t get to know each other growing up.” And as DNA testing grows in popularity, the half-siblings expect their numbers to keep rising.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four. Six was a surprise.”The defeat, along with Hamilton Accies’ surprise win over Hearts on Saturday, means Dundee are now six points from safety down in the top flight drop zone.The postponement of St Mirren’s game at St Johnstone on Saturday because of snow means the Dark Blues remain a point above bottom."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee face mammoth task against celtic but every point is vital says darren odea","story":"Every point is vital for Dundee now but experienced defender Darren O’Dea acknowledges they’ve got a “mammoth effort” ahead of them to get any from Celtic on Sunday.The league leaders and reigning champions head to Dens Park for a lunchtime kick-off on Sunday time as clear favourites to pick up the three points on offer.That would take them one step closer to an eighth-straight title but Irish international O’Dea has no interest in that despite his history with the Parkhead club – his only worry is getting points on the board for the Dark Blues.With the business end of the season on the horizon, the -year-old knows it’s vital Dundee get a leg up on their relegation rivals Hamilton and St Mirren.Despite the Dens men being as much as   with some bookies to pick up a victory, O’Dea has been part of Dundee sides that have picked up results against the Hoops – three goalless draws since his arrival in January .He told the Tele: “Every game is vital but Sunday doesn’t get much harder.“There have been games recently where we could’ve got more out of.“Since I’ve been here we’ve picked up some results against them both home and away but, one thing is for sure, it takes a mammoth effort.“It needs every player to be near the top of their game and we aim to do that this weekend.“It will be dficult and take a huge amount of effort but I don’t think effort is something we’ll have to worry about –we can get that wee bit of quality we’ve lacked at certain times, hopefully, we can pick up a result.”Dundee go into Sunday’s contest on the back of a poor run of form, losing their last three league matches against Hibs, Rangers and then Hearts.It’s not all doom and gloom for O’Dea, however, after an improved display in the - loss to the Jambos at Dens Park last Saturday.With chances spurned and a poor goal conceded, the Edinburgh side left with the points but the centre-half says Dundee can take a lot from their performance into Sunday, evenCeltic’s fluid frontline brings a dferent threat to the direct and physical approach from Craig Levein’s men last week.“Hearts aren’t embarrassed at the way they play and they shouldn’t be, they won the game, but Celtic will be a completely dferent style of play,” O’Dea said.“There are dferent ways to play against that, none of them easy, but the manager will figure out which way we go about it and we know we’re at the stage where every point is vital.”He added: “The Hearts game was scrappy, their style made it that way which is fine but they were very direct but they didn’t create too much.“The goal was an absolute stramash with bodies all over the place and they had Morrison with a shot just after but, bar that, I can’t think of any more shots they had on goal.“We were structured well as a team but we looked dangerous and for it being a really scrappy game we were the ones who created the moments of quality in the game.“For a final ball or a finish, % it wouldn’t have been undeserved to get a point or maybe more but we didn’t.“Now that’s neither here nor there, Hearts have three points and we don’t, but we can take positives from the performance.“We are in the business end of the season so it’s only results that matter but, in terms of endeavour and chances created, there are positives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee pride 2019 to be bigger than last year say organisers","story":"The time and location of Dundee Pride  has been announced — and it looks certain to be a bigger affair than last year’s inaugural march.Slessor Gardens will become a sea of rainbow colours when it hosts the festival on Saturday September .Dundee Pride co-chairmen Tim Kelly and Tommy Small made the announcement at Klozet Bar, as well as outlining the timeline for the march’s organisation.No acts have been confirmed yet but anyone who wants to get involved can make their interest known between April  and June .The same dates apply for prospective stall holders.

The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee uniteds game at dunfermline called off","story":"Dundee United#s game at Dunfermline has been called off.The referee has deemed the East End Park pitch unplayable due to being waterlogged.The Fe club had released a statement at am saying there were no plans to hold a pitch inspection because the pitch was considered playable.

We can beat them in both of those games, we know we’re capable of that but we’d need to win all the other games as well.“What’s important is that we go on a winning run because that’s a massive thing going into the end of the season, whether you’re going for automatic promotion oryou are going to be in the play-offs.”The -year-old’s experience of the second tier tells him how dficult that’s going to be and,anything, he believes putting together a winning run this term is harder than it’s ever been.“I think when you look at the league right now you see that any time you’re playing, there is no guaranteed games you are going to win.“Everyone in the league has something to play for, whether it’s the teams up at the top or the ones down at the bottom.“I think this is one of the tightest seasons I’ve seen for a few years.”That view is backed up by the progress of today’s opponents.Until a five-game winning streak, the Pars were looking over their shoulders and worrying about being dragged into a relegation dogfight.Now they’re in a play-off spot and,they can make it six wins on the trot today, they’d be challenging United in the race for second place.That makes this game almost as vital as the looming clash with Ross County at Tannadice on Tuesday.Stanton knows he and his team-mates will have their work cut out today but stressed the aim is to maintain an unbeaten East End Park record that stretches back to .“As a club we’ve had a good record against Dunfermline and we want to keep that going.“They are on a good run right now but we believe we can go there and win.“If we do win this one we keep a gap to the teams below us.“That’s important but we just have to look to be winning games as often as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united win can put pressure on top dogs ross county","story":"Theof winter weather last weekend, and the raft of postponements it led to, has given Dundee United the chance to put some pressure on leaders Ross County when the Championship’s top two clash at Tannadice tonight.First to fall foul of the conditions was County’s Highland derby trip to Inverness Caley Thistle on Friday evening, that one going off because of a waterlogged pitch.Had it gone ahead, it would have provided the Staggies with the opportunity to stretch their advantage over United in the race for automatic promotion to a massive  points.Their own scheduled action at Dunfermline on Saturday afternoon had to be called off after heavy snow and rain left the East End Park playing surface saturated.United had already arrived at the ground and most of their travelling support were not that far away when the call-off was confirmed just  minutes from kick-off.That made it a frustrating afternoon, particularly as it was clear the pitch was in no fit state for a game to be played.But it still means the Tangerines can cut the deficit to their main rivals to eight pointsthey can beat them.With another clash between the pair to come in the Highlands early next month, a victory would leave boss Robbie Neilson still believing his side can finish in top spot in the second tier.To do that United will have to find the form that’s deserted them in recent outings. They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire primary school blasted hm","story":"NewsAyrshire primary school blasted in HM Inspectors report cardAdditional support is needed to help schoolShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsShared campus of Patna and St. Xaviers primary schools.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has been slated in an HM Inspectors report card. Patna Primary School, which also incorporates an Early Childhood and Support Learning Centre, was rated “weak” across two quality indicators following a recent visit. A team of HM Inspectors visited the school, which shares a campus with St Xavier’s PS, in December, but their findings were only made public last week. The school was deemed to have fallen short under the ‘Learning, teaching and assessment’ quality indicators- with the report stating that, in the majority of lessons, children were “slow to engage in their work” and “required encouragement” to start tasks. Inspectors said that children’s “curiosity and engagement” was “not being developed well enough” and they mentioned an “important weakness” in children’s learning. In another body blow, the school was rated “weak” when it came to raising attainment in literacy and numeracy. The report states: “Overall attainment in literacy and numeracy is weak. As a result, HM Inspector, Carol Copstick, said that the school needed “additional support” in to make “necessary improvements.” HM Inspectors willto the school within a year to ensure that progress is being made. St. Xavier’s Primary School, which is based in the same campus, was deemed to be “very good” and “good” across two key indicators during a  inspection. SNP Doon Valley councillor John Bell, said he was initially shocked by the report and said the school had dedicated, conscientious staff and fantastic, hard-working children.” On a positive note the school was praised for its “caring ethos” and the “positive relationships” fostered by the nursery team. Linda McAulay-Grfiths, East Ayrshire Council’s head of education said: “It’s important to remember that a school inspection report is a snapshot in time and many of the recommendations contained in the Inspector’s report are being implemented, or are already in place.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilScottish National PartyEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year. Staff working at the South Ayrshire Council building in Ayr will be relocated to other offices to allow work to get underway. The move means historic Burns Statue Square will be completely transformed. The decision was announced as part of the council’s budget for the year, which comes into effect next month. The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million. Council leader, the SNP’s Douglas Campbell said: “We will relocate staff from Burns House into properties already owned by the council in Ayr and other town centres to continue to support the local day time economy.” Speaking during his budget speech, he added:”This will result in the demolishing of Burns House commencing during this financial year.” Meanwhile across the road the crumbling Station Hotel remains covered over as question marks hang over its future. It is understood ScotRail staff will neverto the dangerous building. It is believed they are to be housed in new portable cabins across the railway line at empty ground on Station Road. The option of a new new transport hub being built in the vicinity of Burns Statue Square has been mooted in the past. But no solid plan has emerged. Councillor Campbell said: “We maintain dialogue with the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland and Network Rail about future investment at the station. Once we are clearer about their intentions we will begin discussions on the future of Burns Statue Square. “ The council’s former regeneration contractor Ayr Renaissance was tasked with hiring consultants to redesign the space at the top of the High Street.

how does a small childs cross pose a risk to anyone \"And from what we were told, they were going to inform familiesa stone required work to make it safe.\"There are now broken gravestones lying all over our cemetery - this wasnt a safety inspection.\"Scottish Borders Council is responsible for  cemeteries across the region.And they have health and safety obligations for all employees, contractors and visitors to each of the graveyards.Although headstones are the responsibility of the lair-holder, due to the age of many graves tracing families is dficult.A five-year rolling programme of safety checks began in September with  cemeteries earmarked for the initial checks.But for several families the heavy-handed testing regime -

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks. The application at Tweedbridge Court was refused."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-peer-lord-steel-suspended-from-lib-dems-after-giving-evidence-about-cyril-smith","story":"BORDERS peer Lord Steel has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats, pending an investigation into evidence he gave to an inquiry about child abuse allegations against former MP Sir Cyril Smith.The move, announced by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, comes after Lord Steel, a former Scottish Parliament presiding officer, gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseon Wednesday.The party had already announced they have started disciplinary proceedings against him, after he told the probe a conversation with Smith left him \"assuming\" the allegations were correct, but the party did not investigate them.The decision followed a meeting of senior figures within the Scottish party on Thursday evening.In a subsequent statement, the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: \"Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on th March , the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed.\"The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence.\"It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it.\"We appreciate the dficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole.\"At the inquiry Lord Steel denied he had been \"hiding his head in the sand\" over the child abuse allegations made against the former Rochdale MP.Lord Steel said he asked the late politician in  about claims that he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel, and found they dated back to Smiths time as a Labour councillor in the s.He told the inquiry he came away from the conversation with Smith \"assuming\" he had committed the offences, because he did not deny them.Lord Steel recalled Smith had told him police had investigated the claims and taken no action.The IICSA heard no formal inquiry was then held by the Liberal Party into the claims.On the suggestion that no action was taken then because Lord Steel did not want to get involved in a nasty confrontation with Smith, he told the hearing: \"I wouldnt have been hiding my head in the sand.\"These allegations all related to a period some years before he was even an MP and before he was even a member of the party, therefore it did not seem to me that I had any position in the matter at all.\"Smith, who was an MP for Rochdale between  and , is accused of sexually abusing a number of boys.Allegations against him found a greater public spotlight after he died in .,params: .pushLord Steels conversation with Smith was prompted by a story in Private Eye.It came after the Rochdale Alternative Press published a story in  saying police had investigated Smith over allegations of abuse against teenagers at the Cambridge House hostel in the town.Lord Steel told the inquiry: \"He accepted the story was correct. Obviously I disapproved but as far as I was concerned it was past history.\"In a statement released before he was suspended on Thursday, Lord Steel said he wanted to \"clary what happened in  when I asked Cyril Smith about the report in Private Eye\".He added: \"As I told the inquiry yesterday, I did not have that report with me when I tackled him, nor did we discuss the details in it.\"He admitted to me that the report was correct, in that he had been investigated by the police at the time and no action taken against him.\"I had already told the inquiry in writing that in my opinion he had been abusing his position in Rochdale Council , but that had been properly a matter for the police and the council, and not for me, as he was neither an MP nor even a member of the Liberal Party at the time.\"I was in no position to re-open the investigation.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the decision to suspend Lord Steel was taken by the party in Scotland \"quickly, properly and in an orderly way\".He told BBCs Newsnight: \"There was very serious concern about what he said, serious allegations, they have got to be investigated.\"Richard Scorer, a specialist abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, who is acting on behalf of some victims at the inquiry, said: \"My clients will welcome the news that Steel is finally being made to face the consequences of his inaction.\"His failure to stop Smith in , allowing him to go on and abuse more young boys, is inexcusable and he must be held to account.\""},{"url":null,"title":"mountain-bike-trail-plans-unveiled-for-galashiels","story":"THE blueprints for a series of community bike, pedestrian and horse riding trails have been published, sparking concerns from local residents.Plans for a network of trails on Blaikiersquos Hill, above the Langlee area of Galashiels, were first proposed in  by then Gala councillor Bill White.But it has taken until now for detailed plans to be drawn up.The proposed network will connect Ladhope golf course in the northwest, to Langlee in the southeast, and Langlee Mains on the northeast face of Blaikiersquos Hill.The land on which Ladhope golf course sits is owned by the Galashiels common good fund, as is the land containing Langlee woods, while the rest of the hill is privately owned.Trail designer Peter Laing appeared at a meeting of the Galashiels common good fund sub committee this week to unveil the proposed network.He told councillors: ldquoWersquove spoke to all of the landowners and theyrsquore all quite positive about the use of the land for recreation and the upgrading of paths through their ground.ldquoWersquore going through the consultation process which is contacting interested parties and getting their opinions on the scheme.ldquoThere is already existing rights of way, maintained by the council, from Ladhope to Langlee, and one that travels north up to Stow.ldquoThe section on the north west face of the hill will be for families and recreation. There will be easy climbing, and therersquos two possible loops one at Ladhope and one at Langlee, so there is good potential at both ends for family route.ldquoThe other type of route we call lsquofit familyrsquo. Higher grade cycling, running, and walking, on higher ground.ldquoTherersquos loads of potential, itrsquos a big area, the views are fantastic, and people will want to get up there. The only dficulty at the moment is getting up the steep slopes.ldquoSo the bulk of the multi use trail network will be building easy climb trails to get people to the top without too much stress.However, horse riders have voiced concerns over the plans which will could see more mountain bikes sharing the paths with horse riders.And local residents Diane Leaver and Susan Burrow, both of Langlee Mains, attended the meeting.Ms Leaver told councillors: ldquoWersquove already had a handful of incidents with bikes coming down the road to Langlee Mains fast and with dferent residents coming round a steep corner, and the bikes coming the other way.ldquoFortunately they have been far enough away to be able to stop so there hasnrsquot been an accident yet, but, you cannot see cars coming up until yoursquore almost at the junction.Ms Burrow added: ldquoThe main concern is the specic mountain bike tracks, because although where they join the core paths there will be bits for them to slow up, Irsquom not sure that will be enough.,params: .pushldquoMy question is, will I be able to rise safely  Sometimes when wersquore riding along they go lsquooff-pistersquo so to speak, and so therefore therersquos nothing to slow them up.Galashiels and District councillor Harry Scott also voice concerns at the plans, but his main concern is that there isnrsquot ample parking for visitors.He told the committee: ldquoI have mixed feelings about this, Irsquoll be honest with you. The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound - and Humphries, who earns pound, a year from his salary as the Iceland store manager - was allowed to pay it off in instalments of pound a month.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said afterwards: \"This court case sends out a message that Scottish Borders Council will take action against drivers who fail to pay a parking charge issued in any of our Pay and Display car parks.\"To avoid matters going to court, drivers should pay a parking charge notice within the -day deadline.\"Alternatively, to avoid a penalty altogether, simply pay the appropriate parking fee for your vehicles stay.\"It is also a criminal offence for the keeper of a vehicle to fail to give the identication of the driver to the Councila parking charge notice has been issued.\"If anyone is concerned about an outstanding parking charge notice they have received please contact the Councils parking team on    or visit our website.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lorry-driver-accused-of-being-four-times-legal-limit-on-a7-and-a68","story":"A LORRY driver has been accused of being more than four times the alcohol limit while driving through the Borders.Sixty two year old Donald Russell denies driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes -

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"kspbs novice b band impresses","story":"Last Sunday#s Livingston performance was the first time a pipe band of any grade from Campbeltown has taken part in these championships and it was dficult for them to know what to expect.The band was in a category of  others and they needed a good performance, to get a place, as there were a number of top bands playing.Kintyre Schools Band, the top band from a non-fee-paying school, gave a great performance playing Sweet Maid of Glendarual, Greenwood side, Fairwell to Aberdeen and Campbell’s Fairwell to Redcastle.After everyone had played it was over to the judges and the Novice B band was placed as follows: piping adjudicatorone: J Wilson # , PA two:  J Connor-, drumming adjudicator: A Dudgeon-, ensemble adjudicator-D Brown-.When added together this gave the Campbeltown band a total of  points and gave them a very credible fourth place and only two points off the second placed band.After the results were confirmed Pipe Major Fiona Mitchell said how proud she was of her young band and thought th place was a very good start to the season.Both KPBA bands, KSPB and Beinn an Tuirc Kintyre are now practicing hard for the first major pipe band competition of the season when the bands perform at the British Championships in Paisley on Saturday May .KSPB Novice B band perform at Livingston.

proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this.

Some were not told full details until this year, when the case reached the professional watchdog.The council claims it did all it could to keep families informed, but the problems were largely down to one rogue teacher, and the schoolrsquos former deputy head who failed to pass concerns on was disciplined and has subsequently left the profession. Further delays were caused by the school holidays and allowing the police investigation to run its course.But between March and June  when police were finally called in, pupil Arsquos unsuspecting parents had agreed to him having daily one-to-one lessons with Mrs Mackie.

Investigations were launched into this case, but were dropped after the woman left teaching.An education insider at South Lanarkshire Council, has claimed Mrs Mackiersquos mistreatment of pupils would have been reported earlier, but other staff were ldquoafraid of her reactionthey intervened.The claims come as autism and learning disability charities warn that behavioural problems in pupils who are non verbal or on the autistic spectrum are often leading to children being restrained, isolated or mistreated. In fact, parents and charities say such misbehaviour is often an attempt to communicate rather than to be lsquobadrsquo.South Lanarkshire council officials believe the mistreatment was a one off and is not evidence of a pattern within the councilrsquos schools.The council says it runs four tailored programmes for autistic children of dferent ages, delivered in partnership with the National Autistic Society.It has a dedicated resource in Hamilton for people with autism and their families, and has given , primary and secondary teachers training in meeting the needs of autistic pupils.A council spokesman said: ldquoPupil safety and wellbeing is of paramount importance in South Lanarkshirersquos schools.ldquoWe always act swtly and appropriately when any allegations of inappropriate activity are brought to our attention, and that is exactly what happened in this case.Once the concerns were brought to the attention f the headteacher in June , a formal investigation was launched immediately and disciplinary action was instigated, while the matter was reported to both the police and the General Teaching Council.ldquoAt every stage we were as open with parents as possible, given the restrictions imposed on us by the police investigation and subsequent court case, ldquo the spokesman said.ldquoThe school continued to meet parents regularly to work together to help their children, and as part of this we have apologised for any incidents where the high standards that we set, and which parents rightly expect, were not delivered by iniduals.He added: ldquoWe are pleased that all of the pupils referred to in the GTCS hearing, and those whose cases have been raised by the Herald, remain in our schools, with parents and staff working together to give them the best possible educational experience."},{"url":null,"title":"bumper-shetland-oil-fields-could-be-in-production-for-decades","story":"The company has launched a drilling programme that will target two big prospects that could help unlock the potential of a frontier area that sector watchers reckon could help ensure a bright future for the industry.Success for Siccar Point in the programme would encourage other firms to step up the hunt for finds off Shetland.

It just wasnrsquot the person we were expecting.But thatrsquos le on the fictional isles for you. Like Forrest Gumprsquos box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get, apart from the nut cluster that is murder. This series has dealt with the topical subject of people trafficking, with DI Jimmy Perezbeing put through the emotional wringer. While he has encountered some right wrong lsquouns before, the buying and selling of human beings brought him face to face with real evil. Even his beloved daughter Cassie was threatened, which in Perez terms is grounds for declaring global thermonuclear war.Letters: Henshall has a cheekThe story began with a brother looking for his kidnapped sister. Five weeks in and Perez, Tosh and Sandy still hadnrsquot found Zezi. Time was running out, as was the will to live of Zezirsquos mother . Writer David Kane extracted every ounce of tension he could from the will-they-wonrsquot-they find her in time situation, culminating in one devilishly manipulative, and highly effective, scene.While one does not like to cast doubts on his professionalism, Perez has been rather distracted on this case by the presence on Shetland of the lovely Alice, who reckoned she couldnrsquot live without him, and to heck with her husband.Meanwhile, Toshdecided the IT manager at the local fish factory was quite a catch, but with the place closing down it looked like he might have to move south, unless Tosh could learn to trust again and declare her feelings.With all this hearts and flowers nonsense going on you can see why poor Zezi had to wait so long to be found. Then it was time for Perez to do what he does best: lock up the bad guys and apologise to everyone he had offended along the way. It is not easy being a non-caped crusader for justice. Mistakes can happen in the pursuit of truth, things are said that cannot be unsaid.How the series beganThe offer of dinner round at Perezrsquos was not enough to persuade Alice to stick around. ldquoYou need to be apart from the rest of us, she told Perez, condemning him to a letime of gazing out to sea with the collar of his reefer jacket turned up.Crushed like a grape by Alicersquos decision, there was nothing for him to do but go home, where Duncan, Cassiersquos birth father, Perezrsquos co-parent and lodger, and Maryrsquos estranged husband, was preparing to leave. Perez had upset Duncan in a previous series by arresting him during a murder inquiry. This time he had accused him of knowingly renting a property to people traffickers. Awk-ward!There had been enough love lost today, though. ldquoDonrsquot go, Perez pleaded, offering as a sweetener to invest in Duncanrsquos new bar. A cash-strapped Duncan accepted, which keeps him round for series six, where he will doubtless be unfairly accused of crimes against humanity and helicoptered to The Hague to stand trial.All that is in the television future.

It can come in other ways. I have always argued the most likely route for a Peoplersquos Vote is when the Government realises it has got a better chance of getting it through in a public vote in the country than it is in Parliament.

This underlines the importance of the value we place on meeting our environmental obligations as we plan and construct new infrastructure. This book, which provides valuable details on the archaeological finds, will be essential reading for everyone who has an interest in the North-East’s history.”Bruce Mann, Archaeologist for the council, explained: “This book provides more details on our fascinating discoveries from the archaeological works carried out on the AWPR site. For instance, a very unexpected discovery was the presence of Roman activity at Milltimber, likely dating from around   AD. Ninety bread ovens were uncovered, which were probably constructed by the Roman army at a time of invasion led by the Roman General Agricola. However, no evidence of an associated camp was found, which is unusual for these types of features. We can only speculate as to why the ovens were in this location.“Going back to the very earliest finds, there was also evidence of stone tool production dating between about , and , BC at Milltimber, a near unprecedented body of evidence which pushes back our understanding of human activity in north east Scotland by several thousand years.”Bruce continued:“Bronze Age activity was identied from Nether Beanshill in the form of a roundhouse and contemporary cremation complex dating from around , to , BC. The burial comprised of an urn in which the cremated remains of an inidual in their s had been placed. This urn was placed in a pit which was then marked by a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of timber posts.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At this busy time of year, the union is urging applicants to start filling out their SAF and is reminding them that, as things stand, it#s business as usual for all CAP schemes.The union has also said the online application process has seen signicant improvements in recent years and the clear majority of applications are now made online. By submitting your application online, the system will flag any errors before submitting your application.Paper forms will not be automatically posted out and must instead be requested from Local Area Offices. Iniduals can also go to their Local Area Office where staff will be on hand to assist those completing their form online.NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said: “Brexit chaos and confusion are dominating the headlines and generating uncertainty. The crucial thing for all farmers and crofters to bear in mind is that, as things stand, it is business as usual for all CAP schemes and that includes completing this year’s SAF.“The SAF window, which will run from  March to  May, will be punctured by Brexit headlines but we don’t want anyone to inadvertently be distracted from this important process. SAF forms are the most important forms that Scottish farmers fill out every year and I would encourage all members to begin working on their forms as soon as possible to ensure they meet the  May deadline.“For the second year, paper forms will not be automatically sent out by post, with the Scottish Government continuing to encourage claimants to complete their SAF online. Whether you are happy to switch to online or are sticking to paper, the important thing is to take plenty of time and not leave it to the last-minute. Remember, it is the most important day’s work in any farmer’s year.”• Online applications can be submitted via the Scottish Government#s rural payments and services website, at www.ruralpayments.org.A paper copy of the Single Application Form can be picked up at the Scottish Government#s office, in the Government Buildings, on Junction Road, Kirkwall.

The leboat’s entire crew of eight lost their lives as they selflessly headed towards the cargo ship.The crew lost were: coxswain Daniel Kirkpatrick, nd coxswain James Johnston, bowman Ray Kirkpatrick, mechanic Robert Johnston, assistant mechanic James Swanson, and crew Jack Kirkpatrick, Robert Johnston and Eric McFadyen.Longhope RNLI and Longhope Leboat Museum Trust have in recent months, been in the process of preparing for the commemorative events marking  years since the loss of the T.G.B. and her gallant crew.Those events will take place both on land and at sea today, including at the Longhope Leboat Museum, the former leboat shed in Brims, where Longhope leboats were based for many years, before being based at Longhope Pier.Commemorations will also take place in front of the Longhope Leboat Memorial at Osmundwall, and at the YM Hall, Longhope.It is planned that a flotilla of boats, including RNLI leboats from Thurso, Stromness, Wick, and the current Longhope Leboat, plus the Coastguard tug Ievoli Black, an Orkney Harbours tug, pilot boat, and vintage leboat from Ireland, will congregate in Aith Hope, to lower their flags as a mark of respect. The Coastguard will also be represented by one of their rescue helicopters.Flags at leboat stations around Scotland, the RNLI’s Divisional Base in Perth, and at the RNLI’s HQ in Poole will be lowered to half mast.Coverage will appear online on The Orcadian Facebook page today, and in a special supplement in The Orcadian, out on Thursday.Local company Cloudnet IT Solutions also plan to livestream aspects of the events live at: https:livestream accounts  TGBLonghope vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She writes of how appalled she is to learn that there is resistance to a ban on smacking in Scotland.I just had a haunting consultation with a patient who, in their fourth decade and following a diagnosis of lung cancer, started unpacking their box of trauma that had been filled – without their knowledge or consent – since their childhood.We all face adversities of some form throughout le and yes, some have it far worse than others. Although relative to our own personal circumstances, one cannot deny that exposure to high levels of stress and trauma in childhood impacts the quality and development of mental, emotional and physical well-being as we grow into adulthood.As a GP who gets insights into people’s evolving le stories and is fascinated with the root causes of disease, I often find that the seeds of the presentations before me, are often planted at the outset of that inidual’s le. We know that our environments play a huge role in our sense of well-being. For example, a supportive, nurturing and encouraging environment at work will allow an employee to thrive in their role. One where there is bullying and harassment will result in a loss of productivity and growth. The same goes with our personal environments. When we learn to treat one another with mutual respect, irrespective of age or superiority, we begin to see a sht in dynamics which benefits the whole unit.We know that there is a direct link between the types of food we are exposed to, our physical activity levels in childhood and the development of heart disease, obesity and type  diabetes later in le. Similarly, early exposure to trauma, abuse and violence gives rise to mental health, behavioural and emotional problems. We know it’s all connected.So it’s no wonder that I feel appalled to learn that there has been resistance to the smacking ban bill here in Scotland.Hitting a child is physical abuse. It doesn’t teach discipline. It teaches kids that physical assault is acceptableyou want someone to obey your wish. A light smack to one person means something completely dferent to another and, as a doctor working with young, vulnerable people, I’ve seen far too many “light smacks” go wrong. : Smacking ban ‘will change culture around violence’Children need protected and that is the duty of their care-giver but when children are exposed to adverse stressful experiences, it can have a long-lasting impact on their ability to think, interact with others and ultimately on their learning.The truth is thatwe can tackle the issue of violence and abuse against children, we can make waves in tackling some of Scotland’s biggest public health and economic development challenges.Adverse childhood experiences should not be seen as the destiny of someone. Children need to be given the safe space to be taught about the challenges they may encounter in the world someday but those traumas should not be on their doorstep.: Church leaders cite Bible in opposition to Scotland’s smacking banWe are going through epidemics of sorts with chronic diseases largely attributable to our lestyle habits. If we are to reverse these trends, we need to collectively go back to the origins of such diseases. If we eat badly, we cannot teach our kids to eat well. If we glamourise alcohol, drugs and smoking, we must not act surprised when our kids follow in our footsteps. If we use violence to express our frustrations, it would be naive to expect anything dferent from our kids.

I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously.

Mr Guidi claims he is now weeks away from losing the family home he has lived in for the past  years.CYBG said its decisions have been externally reviewed. The dispute was raised by Mr Guidi’s MP, Angela Crawley, in an urgent question in the House of Commons on Tuesday.“I’m  and I’m about to lose my house,” Mr Guidi told The Scotsman. “I’m a desperate man. I’ve been involved in litigation now for several years.“This seemed like the last option I could take. I’m prepared to stay as long as it takes.“The reaction from the public has been brilliant. I’ve received messages of support from as far away as Vietnam.”Asked what it would take to end his protest, he said: “I want the bank to sit down and recognise their fault in the loans they sold me, and subsequently sold on to an American hedge fund.”Speaking in the Commons, Ms Crawley, SNP MP for Lanark and Hamilton East, said Mr Guidi was only one of several business owners to have become entangled in similar legal disputes with lendors. The UK Government said it expected high standards across the financial sector.Ms Crawley told the House: “In  John Guidi built a business in the west of Scotland to a portfolio of almost  properties. Clydesdale Bank backed that business from its very beginning. He has told me how he was treated by bank chiefs as a model customer. In only  years he built a property business worth £ million.“He never missed a payment and was in regular communication with the bank and appeared to have a great relationship with the organisation.“My constituent has informed me that Clydesdale Bank changed the structure of his loans in  and introduced him to tailored business loans. Mr Guidi informed me that in  Clydesdale Bank sold its tailored business loans to Cerebrus Capital Management, an American private equity business.“He says they aggressively pursued the debt and subsequently put his company into receivership a few months after purchase.“As a result of my constituent signing a guarantee he has been made personally bankrupt and the company are pursuing his family home. He only has a few weeks until he is evicted and has taken the decision to start a hunger strike in protest.”Treasury minister John Glen confirmed that Andrew Bailey of the Financial Conduct Authorityhad spoken to Clydesdale Bank about the case in question.He added: “The Government has been consistently clear where there has been inappropriate treatment of SMEs by their bank it is vital these businesses can resolve their disputes and obtain fair redress.“At the Budget last Autumn, the Government set out its support for the FCA’s plans to expand illegibility to complain to the Financial Ombudsman service to small businesses, as well as micro enterprises. “This will ensure that from April  this year, well voter  per cent of UK businesses will have access to fast, free and fair dispute resolution.”A spokeswoman for CYBG told The Scotsman: “We have offered to meet with Mr Guidi to discuss his case.“We are confident the historic complaints raised by Mr Guidi against the bank have been properly reviewed and our decisions have been subject to external and independent review.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work. Intriguingly, some of the documents signed by Mary date from when she was still in France.Experts in the council’s museums and galleries service, which is responsible for the official archives of the city, said the recently unearthed documents revealed an “often overlooked “ aspect of her le.History curator Vicky Garrington said: “Together, the documents shed light on a key part of Scotland’s past. We all know the tragic story of Mary Queen of Scots, her eventful le and eventual execution in , but in these documents we see a dferent side to Mary.“Here, she can be seen carefully managing the everyday affairs of Edinburgh, both from France and Scotland. It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

Sir James said climate change means people should cut their water use by a third, half of all leaking pipes must be repaired, and huge new reservoirs, treatment plants and transport pipes builtEngland is to continue quenching its thirst. “Around  years from now, where those [where demand overtakes supply] lines cross is known by some as the ‘jaws of death’ – the point at which we will not have enough water to supply our needs, unless we take action to change things,” Sir Bevan told the . : Quality of drinking water in Scotland ‘among best in the world’Sir Bevan spoke to the newspaper before a speech at Tuesday’s Waterwise conference in London. He said attitudes to water wastage need to alter, and added that supply companies must understand that climate change is their “biggest operating risk”. Michael Roberts, CEO of strategists Water UK, agrees. : £bn plan to share Scots water with EnglandSpeaking to the iNews, he said: “A twin-track approach is the right way to go, reducing demand for water at the same time as increasing supply to deal with the challenges of growth on the one hand and climate change on the other.” Mr Roberts said water companies have committed to cut leakage by  per cent by  – which could be too late. While the Environment Agency has proposed building new reservoirs and distribution chains in England in order to maintain an adequate supply, others think there are alternative solutions, and bolder plans are required.Peter Murphy, director of consultancy firm UK Water , said Scotland is the answer to England’s problems. He told iNews: “Loch Ness has more water than all of England and Wales combined. And that’s just one loch – Scotland has more than , freshwater lochs, and most are unused. “Scotland has a small population and has about  times more water than it uses. The country’s hydrological cycle is only going to improve – climate change means Scotland is going to get warmer, and therefore wetter.“Scotland’s population will probably increase too, but we should all be thinking about investment and opportunity. Scotland lends itself to water collection – rerouting water to England would cost less than HS. There’s a lot of short-sightedness. “Birmingham would go dry in a dayit wasn’t for Wales. It’s the United Kingdom after all”. Climate change fears Mr Murphy was talking about the Elan Valley Reservoirs, a chain of purpose-built lakes, damns and rivers in mid-Wales, which supply England’s second city. The system was built in the s and finished in  at a cost of £ million. In , the BBC reported Severn Trent Water had begun the £m Birmingham Resilience Project, which will see water from the River Severn at Lickhill pumped into the city. The scheme, set to be completed in , means an emergency supply will be available when the Elan Valley Aqueduct is drained for repairs. Such work shows just how fragile England’s water supply is. By , Britain is forecasted to be regularly enduring summers hotter than the  heatwave, which Sir Bevan said will leave the country with - per cent less water in some rivers.

The design also included upgrading the foundation design in the building to accommodate the additional loads imposed by the fatigue testing. “For us, this really is a great industrial partnership. “Whilst we are still at the early stages of development I know we are creating something that isn’t just a great opportunity for us, it will have real benefit for all the companies using the facility in years to come.”shan.ross@jpimedia©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were.

I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it.

However, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind, Sean was subsequently arrested and convicted under the Terrorism Act  for carrying the flag in circumstances that state authorities deemed to arouse suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation.This week, Sean revealed that his suspended sentence had been quashed with a £ fine issued in its stead following a court appeal against the earlier ruling.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sean said: “From the start of this I was of the opinion that no matter what the outcome of the case was that I was going to be fighting it. If I was convicted, and eventually was convicted, then the benchmark was set and would have big repercussions for republicans right across the board. The point we made was that this was a commemorative event. It was advertised as a commemorative event so we were trying to unravel the agenda of the PPS and the cops.“We’ve been of the opinion that, this is all because we didn’t buy into the Fresh Start Agreement,” he added.“The IRSP has been getting hounded since then. This flag issue was just another signicant push in relation to criminalising the IRSP. On a personal level, I couldn’t accept carrying a flag to commemorate your dead being a criminal offence – it’s unheard of.”Sean’s solicitor, Michael Brentnall, said that while the case has “set the benchmark” in terms of sentencing, the legislation surrounding the conviction stands to be challenged.“I think it’s signicant, particularly the judges remarks at the end, who stated that no person in Ireland should go to jail for carrying a flag in Ireland. That’s signicant in itself and it has set the benchmark for how these matters be dealt with. We’re now seeking senior council’s opinion on whether there is a point of law that can be taken to the court of appeal on the basis of the conviction alone rather than just the sentence.” He continued: “Each case is facts specic, but in Sean’s case it was said during proceedings that every case of somebody carrying a similar flag to a commemoration could be criminalised. Sean was the only person this had been enforced against – there’s an issue with that in itself, but then Sean’s barrister made the point that this was a clear breach of freedom of expression and the sanction was entirely excessive in relation to the context of what had happened.”He added: “Another point that we still have to explore is that the legislation is very vague. The legislation says that you can be a supporter or a member of a proscribed organisation. If this is a means of circumventing membership charges and having somebody landed with a charge then that’s a dferent fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37894868.ece/beb79/BINARY/IUM-BRI-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"delay to brexit must be useful to get eu approval says negotiator","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Well, it’s either one or the other, isn’t it ”He added: “My feeling is … a longer extension needs to be linked to something new.“There needs to be a new event or a new political process.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said any extension to Brexit would have to be ‘useful’ Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the UK would need to provide a “very persuasive plan” to support any request for a long extension to the Article  negotiation process.He told reporters in Brussels: “If there is going to be a request for a long extension of Article  by the UK then there will need to be a very persuasive plan to go with that to explain why that’s needed and how they will use the time to conclude the outstanding issues that haven’t been able to be agreed in London in the context of the Brexit process.”If the EU agrees an extension, Brexit will be delayed by the passage of a statutory instrument through both Houses of Parliament removing the date of March  from the legislation.MPs will be given an opportunity in the House of Commons on Monday to debate how the process should go forward.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated that this will be the point to challenge the Government.Speaking after talks with other opposition parties and Labour backbenchers on the way forward, Mr Corbyn said: “If the Government can’t get a majority for its way on Monday, then I think that’s the time to challenge this Government.“The reality is that this Government has lost its authority, doesn’t enjoy the confidence of the House, can’t get anything through. Surely that is the time to step aside and let the people decide in a people’s vote that’s called a general election.”He added: “I hope that on Monday the House will come together and support some sensible alternatives that can be negotiated during an extension period with the EU.”At a meeting of Cabinet in Downing Street, Mrs May voiced her “absolute determination” that MPs should have another chance to vote on her Brexit deal, despite the bombshell intervention of the Commons Speaker.John Bercow provoked uproar at Westminster on Monday when he ruled that the Government cannot bring the Prime Minister’s deal back for a third “meaningful vote” without substantial changes.But Mrs May told Cabinet she wanted MPs to have another vote “as soon as possible”.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “What you can see from the Prime Minister and her colleagues is an absolute determination to find a way in which Parliament could vote for the UK to leave the European Union with a deal.”Nevertheless, there was said to be concern among some ministers that Brexit appeared to be slipping away.The Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom is understood to have told the meeting: “This used to be the Cabinet that would deliver Brexit and now from what I’m hearing it’s not.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Brexit was in a state of “flux” and that EU leaders will “try to react” to whatever Mrs May proposes on Thursday.Mrs Merkel appeared bemused by Mr Bercow’s decision to block a fresh vote on the basis of a convention dating back to .Speaking in Berlin, she said: “I’ll concede that I wasn’t actively aware of the British Parliament’s rules of procedure from the th century, so I took note of this with interest yesterday.”Downing Street confirmed discussions were continuing with the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up the Government at Westminster, in an effort to build support for the deal after last week’s -vote defeat.And Mrs May held talks on Brexit with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, one of the most strident critics of her Withdrawal Agreement.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  With just  days to go before Britain is formally due to leave, there was exasperation among the EU over the continued deadlock in Westminster.Arriving for a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Germany’s Europe minister Michael Roth said: “Dear friends in London, please deliver.

We didn’t want to give in,” said general manager Sandi Harding, who has worked at the franchise for  years and receives a lot of the credit for keeping it alive well past its expiration date.“We did everything we could to cut costs and keep ourselves relevant.”The store was once one of five Blockbusters owned by the same couple, Ken and Debbie Tisher, in three central Oregon towns.But by last year, the Bend franchise was the last local Blockbuster standing.A Blockbuster Video in Bend, Oregon is the last one on the planet after the only other Blockbuster in Australia announced it’s closing on March .The store is now booming with business from long-time locals as well as tourists. A tight budget meant no money to update the surviving store.That’s paying off now with a nostalgia factor that stops first-time visitors of a certain age in their tracks: the popcorn ceilings, low fluorescent lighting, wire metal video racks and the ubiquitous yellow-and-blue ticket stub logo that was a cultural touchstone for a generation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sandi Harding has worked at the franchise for  years “Most people, I think, when they think about renting videos,they’re the right age, they don’t remember the movie that they went to pick, but they remember who they went with and that freedom of walking the aisles,” said Zeke Kamm, a local resident who is making a documentary about the store called The Last Blockbuster with a friend.“In a lot of towns, the Blockbuster was the only place that was open past nine o’clock, and a lot of them stayed open until midnight, so kids who weren’t hoodlums would come here and look at movies and fall in love with movies.”The Bend store had eight years under its belt as a local video store before it converted to a Blockbuster in , a time when this high desert city was still a sleepy community with a small-town feel to match.Customers kept coming back, drawn by special touches like staff recommendations, a “wish list” for videos to add to the rental selection and even home delivery for a few special customers who couldn’t drive in.Dozens of local teens have worked there over the years.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The store makes a good income from merchandise Then, in , Blockbuster declared bankruptcy, and by , all corporate-owned stores had shuttered.That left locally owned franchises to fend for themselves, and one by one, they closed.When stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, shut down last summer, barely outlasting a Redmond, Oregon, store, Bend’s Blockbuster was the only US location left.Tourists started stopping by to snap selfies, and business picked up.Harding ordered up blue-and-yellow sweat shirts, T-shirts, cups, magnets, bumper stickers, hats and stocking caps from local vendors emblazoned with the words The Last Blockbuster In America, and they flew off the shelves.Then, this month, she got a phone call: The world’s only other Blockbuster, in Perth, Australia, would soon close its doors.A new T-shirt order went out, this time with the slogan The Last Blockbuster On The Planet, and the store is already getting a new wave of selfie-snapping visitors from as far away as Europe and Asia.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The store has become something of a tourist attraction On a recent weekday, Michael Trovato of Melbourne, Australia, stopped by while visiting his twin sister in Bend.After posing for a photo, Trovato said he misses a time when choosing a movie meant browsing hundreds of titles and asking a video clerk for insight instead of letting a movie-streaming service recommend one for him based on a computer algorithm.“I miss quite a bit being able to walk into a Blockbuster or CD store and have that social experience and see people looking at stuff and talking to people,” Trovato said. “It’s something you don’t get from the slick presentation of a music service or, you know, from the internet.”The Bend store doesn’t seem to be in danger of closing anytime soon.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Some parents find things in the store they can’t find online Its newfound fame has been a shot in the arm, and customers stream in to buy  US dollar sweat shirts,  dollar T-shirts and even  dollar yellow-and-blue beanies hand-knit by Harding herself.The store pays Dish Network for the right to use the Blockbuster logo and has several years left on its lease.People regularly send the store boxes of old VHS tapes and DVDs. They also donate Blockbuster memorabilia: a corporate jean jacket, key chains and old membership cards.Employees always send a thank-you note, store manager Dan Montgomery said.Recently, Harding has noticed another type of customer that is giving her hope: a new generation of kids dragged in by their nostalgic parents who later leave happy, holding stacks of rented movies and piles of candy.Jerry Gilless and his we, Elizabeth, brought their two children, John, three, and Ellen, five, and watched with a smile as the siblings bounced from row to row, grabbing Peter Pan and The Lion King and surveying dinosaur cartoons.“How could we not stop  It’s the last one,” said Gilless, of their detour to the store while on vacation from Memphis, Tennessee.“They need to see that not everything’s on the iPad.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man attempts to smuggle three tortoises disguised as pastries","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

Sometimes they even block part of it.

There have been problems with cars parking on the road ever since I moved in here four years ago. Irsquove tried everything in the past to get something done.

But the Department ruled out the installation of a yellow parking line around Cedar Court.He said: ldquoAs the entrance into Cedar Court is a private entrance and does not form part of the adopted road network, the Department is unable to introduce corner waiting restrictions at this location.ldquoIt is, however, an offence to park across a private entrance, or on a footway, in such a manner to cause an obstruction, whether waiting restrictions are in place or not.ldquoIn the past officials have spoken with Down High School to highlight the issue, the last time being in October, . This previously had a positive effect and as such the Department will again speak to the school to ask pupils not to obstruct entrances and footways in a manner that causes inconvenience or danger to local residents.ldquoHowever,this parking behaviour does continue, then it should be reported to the PSNI, who have the power to address these issues.The principal of Down High School, Mrs Maud Perry, said that she was aware of the issue.ldquoThe safety of pedestrians and road users is of utmost importance. Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that.

Those people talk of her apparent lack of remorse for joining Islamic State, which she did in  when she left her East London home as a -year-old and travelled to Syria. Others, including myself feel somewhat sympathetic towards her.I am abhorred by the views she holds but I donrsquot believe her decision to leave her home and her family and travel to Syria is a story without complexities. I see a vulnerable child who was radicalised by extremists while on British soil, in an area of East London I used to call home. I see a young teenager who was married to an IS fighter within two weeks of arriving in Syria and has been brainwashed perhaps beyond repair after witnessing levels of violence and destruction that most of us wouldnrsquot even be able to contemplate. But most tragic of all, I see a young mother who, at just  years of age, has lost three children in the space of four years. To me, thatrsquos an unimaginable level of trauma. And no, she doesnrsquot deserve it. No one deserves such pain.Irsquom not condoning her actions or her behaviour. She should face the legal consequences of her actions. She should be tried in a British court for the crimes she has allegedly committed. That is, after all, why we have the rule of law. But wiping our hands of her and failing to act to protect her son before he died of pneumonia in a grim refugee camp, shows just how much, as a country, the UK has lost its moral compass.Irsquove heard a number of commentators conflating her situation with that of the hundreds of innocent people whorsquove suffered at the hands of IS, particularly the vulnerable Yazidi women who were captured and are now being used as sex slaves. The dference, of course, is that they did not sign up to be a part of the caliphate, like Ms Begum. I am equally horried by the plight of these women and their children.But why do incidents such as this one always come back to whataboutery  Nothing was ever solved by this derailing and deflection technique. It is hypocritical to suggest we should have cared less about Ms Begumrsquos three-week-old baby than those captured or indeed killed by IS. Innocent people are innocent people and we should care equally about each and every one.Just because there are innocent victims still at the behest of ISIS does not negate the fact that the rights of a baby have been ignored and that child has now died, a death that couldrsquove been prevented by the Home Secretary, Savid Javid, had he chosen compassion and humanity over appeasement and pandering to rising populism.Indeed, Ms Begumrsquos case has highlighted a dilemma facing many countries in Europe, ided over whether to allow IS members or supporters to come home and face prosecution or block them. In the Republic, the Irish government may soon have to decide whether to intervene in the case of Lisa Smith, the Dundalk woman who travelled to Syria a number of years ago to join IS.She now has a two-year-old son and the pair are staying in the Al Hawl camp for the family members of Isis fighters.It is sadly too late for Ms Begumrsquos son. But there are countless other children in similar circumstances andnothing , this story should serve as a timely reminder that children are not to blame for their parentsrsquo actions.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

As a committee we want to reassure you all that we as a club will do all we can to help and support your kids andanyone wants to speak and seek help and support we’re here for you, so please speak up #itsgoodtotalk. Local girl Eimear Tallon summed up the incident in a moving and heartbreaking online blog.She wrote: “It started with pushing and shoving but everyone was still laughing and having a good time. Then the literal crushing started.“The people on the outside of this line were so determined to get in they felt the need to not only push us against the wall but push with all their strength. No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement.Teenage victims of the disco horror“Two of my friends fell to the ground. I tried to pull them up but at that point there was no room for them to even come back up. So I started screaming at the top of my lungs: “My friends are on the ground, move back!”“My friends have fainted, move back!” BM off to flying start as it open doors Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“My friends can’t breath, move back!”- nothing. Not one bit of movement.“I could still see people laughing with no idea what was going on. At this point I thought my friends were going to die, I was standing up and I couldn’t breath so I couldn’t imagine how they felt. I was hysterically screaming for people to move but it was only the people around me who knew the seriousness.“With more and more pushing, I also fell. But the thing about me was that I wasn’t on the ground, I was on top of someone, and this person was on top of someone . As I looked down I could see multiple bodies underneath me and as I looked up I could see multiple bodies on top of me. It was the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my le.“I was looking about for my friends and trying to keep my head up. As dramatic as it sounds, I closed my eyes for a little and accepted what was going to happen however, an elbow to my throat soon woke me up. People were scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breath. I think that’s what really shows the seriousness of it all, people were literally fighting for their lives.“It got to a point where even when I had my eyes open, I couldn’t see. It felt like this went on forever but eventually I felt bodies being dragged over me and beside me. It wasn’t the bouncers and it wasn’t the police, it was the young people in the line who pulled me out.“My leg was caught underneath someone and my hair was caught somewhere , my jeans were pulled down around my thighs and my jersey above my head but I was getting pulled out nonetheless. I lay on the ground and opened my eyes, I remember seeing some motionless legs, a few socks and shoes and then I was pulled up and brought away.“I rang my parents to explain what had happened and let them know I was okay, I then tried to find my friends. I ran about frantically. I seen a young boy lying motionless trying to be resuscitated by the ambulance crew and I seen his friends screech as they found out he wasn’t going to make it.“I don’t think I will ever experience more relief in my le than when I seen one of my friends that had fallen, I was shocked she was alive. We all eventually found each other apart from my other friend that had fallen. We heard people had seen him, that he was roughed up but he was okay, I needed to see him myself though. He then came running towards us sobbing and all we could do was hug him.“These ‘people’ aren’t just ‘people’, they were young people, teenagers at   years old. They were only children.“It could’ve been anyone.“Unfortunately, a friend of mine who I had seen in the line and chatted to minutes beforehand has died. Morgan and the two other angels, just like the rest of us, left their families last night for an enjoyable night out but unlike the rest of us, they didn’t make it home. My heart breaks for their poor families.“There is no sugar coating what happened last night. As it got serious, we banged the windows of the hotel and tried to get help. The people inside simply looked away. While this was happening the gates were still locked and the bouncers were no help. If it wasn’t for the young people doing the right thing and ringing the police, the situation could’ve been so much worse.“The truth is, this could’ve been prevented.

INLM-gcOften her fees were waived for those who might struggle to pay and the respect she was held in the town was unparalleled.Rosemary came to prominence as the solicitor for some high profile republicans, including Colin Duffy.She also represented the family of Robbie Hamill who was killed after a barbaric kicking in Portadown in .She also worked as a solictor for the Garvaghy Residents Association during the Drumcree disputes in Portadown in the late s.However the vast majority of her clients were ordinary local people.Rosemary was killed in March ,  after a bomb exploded under her car outside her home close to a local primary school in Lurgan.The murder was claimed by the loyalist gang, the Red Hand Defenders however there was widespread concern of security force collusion in the murder.Mrs Nelson had previously complained that she had received numerous death threats and had voiced these concerns with the United Nations and US Congress.A public inquiry into her murder found no evidence that the security forces had ‘directlly facilitated’ her murder but ‘could not exclude the possibility’ that inidual members had helped the perpetrators.On her th anniversary her children paid tribute to their mother.In a statement on Friday they said: “Today marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

Even in her younger years she noted that the odds were stacked, but that didn’t stop her from hurtling towards opportunities and dismantling the obstacles anyway – for herself, and others, too.“For those who witnessed Rosemary in a professional setting, it was her steely faith which drew attention – that unfaltering conviction which commanded her working days. She instilled belief in her clients, and they in turn placed their confidence in her. “When it comes to the many at the receiving end of Rosemary’s help, it’s hard to determine just what their lingering memories are – but perhaps that’s the point. Through the power of her compassion, the four walls of the Lurgan office transformed into a confidential haven whereupon sadness was shielded fears unleashed and faith restored.“But for those closest to Rosemary – and lucky enough to occupy that special, padlocked component of her heart – she was so, so much more. “She sprinkled her laughter and zest-for-le passion upon any occasion, and set more than one meal alight during her cooking forays.“Though Rosemary’s driving was impressive, her sense of direction left a lot to be desired, and the sounds of the Lighthouse Family and Mary Black were the backdrop of choice to any long journey.“She loved her family and friends fiercely, and through her parents, siblings, husband, and children, her greatest fuel was forged.“And as the darkness of each night reared, Rosemary gathered her children before her as she wiped off her make-up chatting, laughing, and ensuring that a reaffirmation of love lulled them off to a peaceful sleep.“Today on the th anniversary, we’re hugely saddened as we reflect on the loss of Rosemary’s le. We grieve for the milestones which we should have shared the lessons which we were yet to learn the unwritten chapters which lay before us with hope and expectation.“But mostly we’re grateful for the blessings which Rosemary’s letime brought us. And as we continue to pave our own paths, we will always take fuel from her, just as she did from us.“Thank you, mum. We miss you.”Also on her anniversary some of her colleagues paid tribute to Mrs Nelson.KRW Law Human Rights said: “Thoughts and prayers with the family and friends of our esteemed professional colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.”Madden  Finucane Solicitors said: “Fond memories of our friend and colleague Rosemary Nelson on the th anniversary of her murder.T”oday marks the th anniversary of the passing of prominent human rights lawyer, Rosemary Nelson.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there.

And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.”On the current political uncertainty, he says: “The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.”Meanwhile, lettings in Belfast are expected to remain buoyant this year despite the uncertain political climate, according to a report from Lambert Smith Hampton.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
