It is now 14.4 per cent and 25.5 per cent, respectively. Caroline Cerny, Alliance Lead at the Obesity Health Alliance, said: \u0027In 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised the nation he would make healthier choices easier for everyone.\u0027Rowing back on these promises now would leave him with the legacy as the leader who cancelled laws which would prevent thousands of children from developing obesity.\u0027 Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: \u0027We urge the Prime Minister to hold fast and put the nations\u0027 health first, not bow to industry pressure.\u0027 Professor Rachel Batterham, special advisor on obesity at the Royal College of Physicians, said: \u0027It is incredibly concerning to hear that the prime minister might row back on plans to stem the tide of aggressive marketing of unhealthy food and drink.\u0027This could have devastating consequences, particularly for children and young people.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"As zoo Johnny Morris childhood favourite closes CHRISTOPHER STEVENS reminisces","story":"Share this article        The outdoor sequences were shot without sound.

the UK, only five to 11-year-olds who have a weakened immune system, or live with someone who does, are eligible for two doses of the vaccine.The JCVI\u0027s update was originally due last Friday but it was pushed back to Monday before being delayed again.Normally the panel\u0027s recommendations are accepted by the Department of Health and implemented within a matter of days.But there are reports that No10 stepped in and blocked its publication last week so it could \u0027review\u0027 the advice.It is unclear what exactly is causing the hold up, but in the past ministers have expressed frustration at the JCVI\u0027s caution over jabbing children.The group initially dragged its heels on recommending jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds in September, citing a lack of safety data and concerns about side-effects. In the end ministers had to circumvent the JCVI, and relied on Professor Chris Whitty and the chief medical officers in the devolved nations to approve the jabs on the basis they would prevent further disruption to schooling. There is a suggestion the Government wanted to announce the roll out to five to 11-year-olds as part of Boris Johnson\u0027s plan for England to live with Covid like flu.That strategy is set to be unveiled in Parliament after the recess on February 21 and include radical plans to ditch even the most fundamental Covid rules.  But only half of 12 to 15-year-olds have received a Covid jab in England and just 20 per cent are double-vaccinated – raising questions about the level of public demand for the move.A JCVI source told MailOnline that opening the jabs to the age group will appease \u0027parents who are desperate to have the choice\u0027, but added that nobody on the committee was \u0027particularly vocal\u0027 about wanting to jab healthy children.Clinically vulnerable five to 11-year-olds were recommended two doses Pfizer jab in late December to protect them against the rapidly spreading Omicron variant. Reports over the weekend said the new JCVI recommendation stresses that the offer to healthy primary-aged children is presented as \u0027non-urgent\u0027.Healthy children face a vanishingly low risk of severe illness from the virus, with only six healthy children dying of the virus in England\u0027s first year of the pandemic. And two doses of a jab offers as little as 10 per cent protection against catching the antibody-resistant Omicron variant, UK data suggests, but it will have stronger effects on moderate and severe illness.Many scientists have questioned the need to vaccinate children when so many have already had Covid.The Office of National Statistics estimates nearly three-quarters of youngsters aged 8 to 11 had Covid antibodies as of January 10. "},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options

considered","story":"RTÉ brings in some €200 million a year in licence fee income, though the State broadcaster has long complained the rate of evasion and avoidance costs it huge sums every year.The Revenue Commissioners would be asked to collect the television licence fee in the future under a proposal to be considered later this month by Ministers. The move aims to bolster funding for public service broadcasting and reduce the numbers not paying the charge, with the rate of evasion estimated to be running at about 15 per cent. The Government is expected to reject a recommendation from the Future of Media Commission that the €160 annual fee be scrapped totally and replaced with direct exchequer funding for RTÉ, according to senior figures with knowledge of the discussions that have taken place on the issue.Instead, sources expect that the Revenue Commissioners would in future be asked to collect the charge. RTÉ estimates that it loses out on some €50 million a year in revenue because of non-payment of the fee. Evasion ratesIt is hoped that transferring responsibility to the Revenue Commissioners for collecting it will dramatically reduce evasion rates. However, sources say that detailed discussions with Revenue, and possibly legislation, would be required before the change could come into effect.All consumers of television programmes are required to pay the charge, with those who do not open to a fine of up to €1,000 (or €2,000 for subsequent offences). An Post is currently responsible for issuing licences and collecting payments. RTÉ brings in some €200 million a year in licence fee income, though the State broadcaster has long complained that the rate of evasion and avoidance costs it huge sums every year. An additional €140 million of its €340 million annual budget comes from commercial activities, principally advertising. Additional fundingGovernment sources say that no decisions have been made by the Cabinet yet, but that senior officials are likely to meet next week to prepare for a committee meeting on the issue. Once they can reach agreement, it is expected that the matter will come before Cabinet at the end of this month.With additional funding expected to be brought in under Revenue supervision of the regime, it is expected that part of this could be made available to other broadcasters producing public service content.Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin received the report of the Future of Media Commission, chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, last year but there was immediate opposition from Ministers to its recommendation to fund RTÉ directly from the exchequer.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"lot of road left in long running mica redress issue","story":"Mica-affected  homeowners have run a relentless and exhausting campaign highlighting the scale of the damage they are being forced to live with because of the material causing blocks in their homes to crumble, and the dangers posed by their defective homes. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Photos Dublin.Up until last Wednesday, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien was still referencing the most controversial aspect of his mica plan in responses to parliamentary questions.Reports had been rife that the Government was planning to drop the sliding scale – a way to calculate the level of redress available to owners of defective homes based on the square footage of the property – but O’Brien still mentioned it.Then on Thursday, he appeared before the Oireachtas housing committee and said it was “unlikely there will be a sliding scale in the final set-up”, with his comments going under the radar on the day.When the Government announced an enhanced scheme for mica-affected properties last November, it quickly became obvious that the scale was one of the most controversial elements. The proposal was that grants would cover rebuilding costs at €145 per sq ft on the first 1,000sq ft, €110 for the next 1,000sq ft and €100 thereafter. Homeowners swiftly said the scale would have to go as it meant they could be left footing bills of up to tens of thousands of euro.Political sources say that in an attempt to take the heat out of the issue, it was kicked on to the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland (SCSI) to ensure that the per sq ft price was a fair reflection of the cost.“The sliding scale was only ever supposed to be an indicator, but it shouldn’t have been put in there because it became this sort of holy grail,” a source said.Cost reportsThe latest fly in the ointment was the society saying it does not use sliding scales in any of its construction cost reports. And so, the most controversial element of the plan has been dropped in favour of a system which will see an estimated rebuild cost given for eight different types of houses. These range from a two-bed terrace house to a five-bed in a rural area.Questions have immediately arisen about whether this will leave the State exposed to a significantly higher bill than the €2.2 billion already set aside.“We don’t know yet, we won’t know until the SCSI come back at the end of the month with their final report,” one source said.Another Coalition figure said they would be “surprised” if the bill rises much beyond what was already budgeted for.Behind closed doors, it’s the same story as last year, with civil servants and officials trying to temper the expectations and desires of the political system.“There is massive resistance amongst the officials to any extra costs – they were uncomfortable enough as it was,” one source said.Indeed, some officials have expressed a belief that the demands of mica homeowners were previously “off the scale” in financial terms.ExhaustingThe homeowners have run a relentless and exhausting campaign highlighting the scale of the damage they are being forced to live with because of the material causing blocks in their homes to crumble, and the dangers posed by their defective homes.The same issues look set to arise again: a desire to ensure there are controls on spending versus homeowners protesting that they cannot afford to face large costs to repair their homes.Another pressure point building is that the works supported will only cover the cost of restoring houses to pre-2007 building standards. The Government says it was always intended that homes would be rebuilt on a like-for-like basis and it seems they intend to hold firm on this, for now at least.One political source also cautioned that another issue could emerge as a hot potato. The Housing Agency will, in time, act as agents for each local authority in assessing, testing and categorising the redress applications received. Crucially, they may also decide which of the worst-affected homes will be prioritised.“There is concern about this becoming a political issue, as homeowners compete with other homeowners to get their properties fixed first. What will the criteria be? What happens when disputes arise?” they said.With weeks to go until the SCSI issues its final report, there is still a lot of road left in this long-running issue."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator

understood to be continuing to offer its full co-operation to the politan Police.It has been alleged that Michael Fawcett, the former chief executive of the Prince\u0027s Foundation and one of the Prince of Wales\u0027s closest aides, tried to help secure a knighthood and British citizenship for a Saudi billionaire donor.The allegations centered on claims that Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei

knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.Mr Fawcett, who resigned from the Prince\u0027s Foundation in the wake of the claims, is

She told Senedd members: “We’re not going to do that as a matter of urgency, as we did over the Christmas period. That’s partly because the risk isn’t as great to that cohort.“And we’re also waiting to hear from the JCVI to see whether they’ll need a booster on top of the booster for older age groups in the spring.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: \u0026#39We don\u0026#39t see any withdrawal yet\u0026#39, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Risk of \u0026#39full-blooded\u0026#39 Russian invasion exaggerated by Western governments, says former MI6 chiefPrince Andrew \u0026#39set to keep remaining titles\u0026#39 after settling sexual assault case with Virginia GiuffreWelby claims he\u0026#39s \u0026#34not the Pope\u0026#34 – but he\u0026#39s acting like one\u0026#39Putin’s behaviour is explainable, but that doesn’t justify it\u0026#39: Sherelle Jacobs responds to readersMet launches cash-for-honours investigation into Prince Charles\u0026#39s charityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secrets number 10 front door","story":"As with so much to do with 10 Downing Street right now, establishing the facts about its famous front door isn’t always as straightforward. A  reader wrote a Letter to the Editor this week, to correct no less an eminence than Sandi Toksvig on the question of why the zero on the threshold to the Prime Minister’s residence is skew-whiff.On the BBC’s brainbox television show, QI, Toksvig had explained that the 37-degree tilt to the left on the numeral ‘0’ in question “had always been” that way since what had hitherto been 5 Downing Street was redesignated 10 Downing Street in 1779.  But the letter’s author, Malvern Harper, who had trained as a sign writer in the 1960s, recalled that his tutor had told him the slant was because the number ‘0’ was actually a capitalised letter ‘O’ in the same unusual typography used on Emperor Trajan’s Column in Rome in AD113.Both explanations can be found in the many histories of Downing Street written since Sir Robert Walpole took up residence there in 1732 at the invitation of George II. And there is even a variation that suggests the official Department of Works, as a result of another round of austerity which coincided with the renovation of Numbers 10, 11 and 12 in the early 1960s, had simply run out of ‘0’s. In the spirit of make do and mend, they substituted a spare Trajan ‘O’ as the next best thing.Which account is right? Even as one who has experienced that frisson – as if a very small footnote in history – of stepping over the threshold, I’ve no idea. But I can report some other secrets that the Downing Street door hides in plain sight. The original six-panel Georgian door, made of black oak, was installed in 1772 when Lord North was Prime Minister, as part of extensive renovations that saw three Downing Street properties knocked into one of suitable grandeur. Its 1991 replacement is made of black gloss-finish steel, installed for added security after an IRA attack, when John Major was PM, saw a mortar land in Number 10’s back garden. (When it needs maintenance, it has an equally robust twin that holds the fort.)If you can see past the press pack regularly gathered outside, the eagle-eyed will notice that there is no lock in which to put a key, and no handle. This is a door than can only be opened from the inside, where – because the brass door bell to its right is for decorative purposes only – a security guard is on duty 247, watching security cameras so it can swing open as if by magic on cue to allow in prime ministers, ministers, monarchs and assorted visiting dignitaries.  Or, on occasion, fail to open: as once when the Blair family were briefly left stranded on the doorstep, or worse in 2016 when US Secretary of State, John Kerry, came for his first meeting with Theresa May and walked straight into the door.  For those wanting to find a more discreet way into 10 Downing Street – and I will leave it to your imagination why that might be necessary – there is a back door, which does boast its own keyhole. If only they could train Larry the resident Downing Street cat to make use of it.There is something solid, serious and stately about today\u0027s glossy black door. Back in 1908, however, Herbert Asquith decreed – at the instigation, it is said, of his wife, the celebrated wit and socialite, Margot – that black was passé. Instead it was given a lick of what historical paint consultants have suggested was either Brunswick Green or Bronze Green, as popular then with those in the know as gold wallpaper is today.  The experiment didn’t last. Asquith\u0027s successor, David Lloyd George, known for his colourful turn of phrase and private life, proved to be more sober and traditional when it came to picking paint.If you have ever wondered why those delivering petitions to the Prime Minister can’t just slip their bundle of papers through the shiny brass letter box, there is an easy answer. Despite appearances, it is not a letter-box at all, but a shiny brass plate simply made to look like one (for security purposes) inscribed with the words First Lord of the Treasury. When Sir Robert Walpole took on the house in 1735, that was his official title, though he was de facto Prime Minister. All his successors since 1905 have held both offices simultaneously. The original lion’s head door-furniture was made of cast iron, the essential ingredient of the Industrial Revolution that began in Britain. At the outset of the First World War, soldiers about to depart for the trenches are reported to have walked up Downing Street to touch the knocker for good luck. During the 1960 renovations it was replaced by a brass lion\u0027s head painted black with Downing Street now out of bounds to the casual passer-by, it is in no immediate danger of being rubbed off.There are other alternatives at hand. Close by is the original door, on display in the Churchill War Rooms, or else wander down Whitehall, onto the Strand and turn into Adam Street, where a near identical front door, with similar frame and façade around it, is available free of charge at Number 10. But position yourself carefully for maximum authenticity. This door does have a lock.  More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: \u0026#39We don\u0026#39t see any withdrawal yet\u0026#39, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Risk of \u0026#39full-blooded\u0026#39 Russian invasion exaggerated by Western governments, says former MI6 chiefPrince Andrew \u0026#39set to keep remaining titles\u0026#39 after settling sexual assault case with Virginia GiuffreWelby claims he\u0026#39s \u0026#34not the Pope\u0026#34 – but he\u0026#39s acting like one\u0026#39Putin’s behaviour is explainable, but that doesn’t justify it\u0026#39: Sherelle Jacobs responds to readersMet launches cash-for-honours investigation into Prince Charles\u0026#39s charityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tory faithful have new darling not truss","story":"Few politicians have emerged from the events of the last few weeks with their reputations enhanced, but the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, is the exception. His cool and deft handling of the Ukraine crisis has impressed even those who felt that he was only appointed because of his long-term support for Boris Johnson.So impressed are some of his fellow MPs that they even whisper about him having become a contender for the leadership. They can’t have failed to notice that he has overtaken The Trussette in the monthly Conservative Home popularity polls, and he has done it without trying to take the form of a Margaret Thatcher reincarnation.Certainly, he has resisted the oh-too-obvious photo opportunities that his predecessors loved so much. He doesn’t need to prove his credentials. He just gets on with the job, a lesson some of his more iridescent colleagues could learn from.Wallace seems to be a natural conciliator and has been seen as the leader among Europe’s defence ministers. “What does Ben think,” is the question most often asked by them. The Baltic states almost worship him and his article posted on the MoD website a few weeks ago, outlining what was at stake, is considered a masterpiece.It is true that the Defence Secretary doesn’t have the flair of a Sunak or the television mastery of a Zahawi, but he has “bottom”, and in war situations that counts for a lot. So yes, he now has to be mentioned as a contender – but as a contender for what?One senior Conservative told me that he would like to sit Wallace down and tell him to forget talk of becoming prime minister. What he should be aiming for now is to be the next secretary general of Nato.A Briton hasn’t held the post in nearly 20 years – in fact, not since George Robertson, who was defence secretary under Tony Blair. The alliance has lost its way. Perhaps Wallace is just the man to rescue it.I’ve probably spent more hours on the radio than any other presenter in the country discussing the Ukraine crisis. We have had some fantastic contributors. Tom in Brighton gave a masterpiece of a lesson on the history of Ukraine which was so good that I invited him to record a 40-minute podcast on the subject with me. On Monday, we had Alex in Nottingham giving us a tour de force on Vladimir Putin’s desire to create a Greater Russia. He spoke for 10 minutes with barely an interruption from me.However, what I have noticed above all else is the dark side of some of these conversations, where people ring in with one aim – to give Putin the benefit of the doubt and to question the motives of Nato or their own government.In previous times, they would have been called quislings. They genuinely believe that Nato is an evil force, bent on attacking Russia, while Putin is a leader who is merely intent on looking after his own people and probably loves animals, too. The BBC is biased in favour of the Conservatives and Russia Today is the very model of balance, according to these misguided idiots.I give as good as I get, and then get accused of hating Russia and being a warmonger. What has happened to us when, among a sizeable proportion of the public, the default position appears to be to automatically take the side of the country’s enemies?Iain Duncan Smith once said that a new political leader has 90 days to convince people they have got what it takes. Seventy-three days after the Republicans picked her to carry the centre-Right banner into the French presidential elections, Valérie Pécresse has convinced no one that she can beat the eminently beatable Emmanuel Macron. She looks the part, but her stuttering campaign is close to collapse.She tries to portray herself as a French Margaret Thatcher yet she convinces no one. On Monday she gave a pedestrian speech in a hangar in which even Barack Obama would have found it difficult to whip up a crowd. It was full of nationalist dog whistles, but it ignored the fact that the type of voters which this rhetoric appeals to won’t vote for a pale substitute. They have got Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour to choose from already.It’s not too late to dump Pecresse. Perhaps Michel Barnier’s time will come, after all? Ze clock is ticking.Today, the good burghers of the North East will be facing the wrath of Storm Dudley. This is somewhat ironic given Dudley is in the West Midlands.I had always thought the point of naming storms was to make people sit up, pay attention and worry. So let me pose a gentle question to you. Does a weatherperson uttering the phrase “Storm Dudley” or “Storm Eunice” (Eunice is next on the alphabetical Met Office list) strike terror into your heart and make you ponder battening down the hatches? Thought not.What we surely all want is Storm Tyson, Storm Griselda or Storm Cruella. At least we’d know what we were in for.Iain Dale presents the evening show on LBC RadioMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: \u0026#39We don\u0026#39t see any withdrawal yet\u0026#39, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Risk of \u0026#39full-blooded\u0026#39 Russian invasion exaggerated by Western governments, says former MI6 chiefPrince Andrew \u0026#39set to keep remaining titles\u0026#39 after settling sexual assault case with Virginia GiuffreWelby claims he\u0026#39s \u0026#34not the Pope\u0026#34 – but he\u0026#39s acting like one\u0026#39Putin’s behaviour is explainable, but that doesn’t justify it\u0026#39: Sherelle Jacobs responds to readersMet launches cash-for-honours investigation into Prince Charles\u0026#39s charityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two glasses wine can contain calories burger","story":"Adults can exceed their recommended daily limit of sugar by drinking just two glasses of wine, experts have warned.Drinks can also be packed with calories and in some cases two glasses of wine can contain more calories than a hamburger.The Alcohol Health Alliance UK (AHA) said that product labelling on alcoholic drinks was woefully inadequate as it published new analysis on popular wines.It looked at the calorie and sugar content of 30 bottles of red, white, rose, fruit and sparkling wine sold in the UK.The alliance, which represents more than 60 health organisations, said that there is a wide variation of sugar and calories across different wines, but they said that with this information missing from most labels consumers are being kept in the dark about what they are drinking.It said that government guidelines recommend that adults should consume no more than 30g of so-called free sugars per day, but it is possible to reach almost this entire amount by drinking two medium glasses of wine.The AHA analysis suggested that many of the most sugar-packed wines were the ones which had the lowest strength of alcohol.It said that with no legal requirement to display sugar content on alcohol labels, drinkers may opt for a lower-strength alcohol thinking that this is a healthier option but could unwittingly be upping their daily sugar intake.The analysis also examined the calories in wine.The AHA said that just two medium-sized glasses of the most calorific wines analysed contain more calories than a McDonald\u0027s hamburger.Wines with high calorie content also tended to be higher strength drinks.The AHA said that none of the 30 products examined in the study displayed sugar content on their labels - information which is required for all non-alcoholic drinks.Calorie content was only displayed on 20 per cent of the labels examined.Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, the chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said: Alcohol\u0027s current exemption from food and drink labelling rules is absurd.Shoppers who buy milk or orange juice have sugar content and nutritional information right at their fingertips.But this information is not required when it comes to alcohol - a product not just fuelling obesity but with widespread health harms and linked to seven types of cancer.The Government must publish its planned consultation on alcohol labelling without further delay - which we have been waiting for since 2020.As well as calorie labelling and nutritional information, we need prominent health warnings and the UK Chief Medical Officers\u0027 low-risk weekly drinking guidelines on labels. Studies suggest that this could help reduce alcohol harm by increasing knowledge of the health risks and prompting behaviour change.Alison Douglas, the chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, added: Alcohol labelling is woefully inadequate in this country and allows the alcohol industry to decide what information it will and won\u0027t include on its products, despite alcohol claiming the lives of 70 people a day in the UK.The alcohol industry have dragged their feet for long enough - unless labelling requirements are set out in law, we will continue to be kept in the dark about what is in our drinks.People want and need reliable information directly on bottles and cans, where it can usefully inform their decisions.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: \u0026#39We don\u0026#39t see any withdrawal yet\u0026#39, says Volodymyr ZelenskyPolitics latest news: Risk of \u0026#39full-blooded\u0026#39 Russian invasion exaggerated by Western governments, says former MI6 chiefPrince Andrew \u0026#39set to keep remaining titles\u0026#39 after settling sexual assault case with Virginia GiuffreWelby claims he\u0026#39s \u0026#34not the Pope\u0026#34 – but he\u0026#39s acting like one\u0026#39Putin’s behaviour is explainable, but that doesn’t justify it\u0026#39: Sherelle Jacobs responds to readersMet launches cash-for-honours investigation into Prince Charles\u0026#39s charityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds curry houses may not","story":"Exclusive: Hundreds of curry houses may not survive huge £, fuel and ingredients hikeMonthly electricity bills for the UK’s , Indian restaurants are up £ to £, from £ to £ last year, says trade magazine SpiceDaraz AzizByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsHundreds of curry houses may not survive a £,-a-year rise in fuel and ingredient prices. Thousands of jobs and Britain’s favourite dish, tikka masala, are at risk, warns an expert. Monthly electricity bills for the UK’s , Indian restaurants are up £ to £, from £ to £ last year, says trade magazine Spice. Yet restaurant and takeaway owners facing a big financial squeeze fear that charging more will hit trade. Mango chutney has soared % in recent months from p to £. per kilo. Restaurants uses kg a month. A kilo of fresh chicken breast is up from £. to £., a kg sack of onions £. instead of £., and cardamom £ per kilo from £.  Industry figures want more Government help, such as VAT and council tax cuts and business rates relief. Enam Ali, founder of the Spice Business and the British Curry Awards, said: “These cost increases are unsustainable. “After years of pain caused by the lack of skilled chefs and the Covid crisis, the curry industry is now being hit by cost increases in everything from gas to cardamom, vegetable oil to mango chutney. “Unless costs come under control, many hundreds of curry restaurants will go under, thousands of jobs will be lost. “The great British tikka masala - the country’s favourite dish - is under threat as never before.”  Baabzi Miah, whose family has run takeaways and restaurants in Warwick for  years, said some monthly gas bills are up to £, and without Government action he would have to “lock the doors.” Daraz Aziz, pictured, runs three curry restaurants in Northumberland and the Passage to India railway dining experience, which takes diners from Newcastle to The Valley restaurant in Corbridge. He said he was unwilling to pass on price rises to customers and did not want to rely on more grants or temporary fixes. He said: “Businesses cannot sustain on grants from Government. They need to do something in the mechanism.” The International Chamber of Commerce said trade needs to be simpler, cheaper and faster for curry restaurants.” A Treasury spokesman said: “We’ve supported hospitality jobs and businesses through the pandemic.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryFoodCouncil taxEnergy billsPrice rises\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Serve the food you really want to eat by signing up for our tips and recipes and never be bored by your cooking againSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The radical idea gives people a set payment to replace the benefit system and prepare for an age of robots taking over jobs. Under ‘Universal’ Basic Incomethis money could even go to all adults, rich or poor, working or not. However, the pilot announced today will apply only to about  young adults who have just left the care system in Wales. The Welsh Government said young people leaving care who turn , across all council areas, will be offered the chance to receive £, a month for two years. The trial will begin by April  and the window to join will be open for one year. That means around  people are expected to become eligible.  They will also be given “financial well-being training” to “build up their confidence” for a le outside care. It is said to be the highest amount offered on a Basic Income scheme anywhere in the world. It will be taxed like income from a job, and replace most benefits.Tory ministers are opposed to a wider UBI, and last year the cross-party Work and Pensions Committee said we are not convinced it would be the right way forward for the UK. But the Labour-run Welsh government said it would help care leavers transition into everyday adult le - as inflation hit .% today but benefits rise by just .% in April. Minister for Social Justice Jane Hutt said: “We know we’re in the midst of a cost of living crisis and we’re determined to continually look at how best to support iniduals in Wales who live in poverty. “Care leavers have a right to be properly supported as they develop into independent young adults. “It’s also important to note that this policy is underpinned by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , emphasising our commitment to strengthening the rights of children and young people in Wales.” The Welsh Government’s Technical Advisory Group on Basic Income, chaired by Professor Sir Michael Marmot said: “We may have dfering opinions on how a basic income can work on a wider scale. [But] we can all agree that any scheme aimed at helping a particularly vulnerable group should be welcomed and intend to provide Welsh Government with the support it needs in making this a success.”Labouraposs Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary said in September that while he was “interested” in UBI, it is not yet “in any way feasible”. Jonathan Reynolds, who previously offered support for the idea, said: “I’ll always engage in the debate, but there’s obviously not a plan I can look at to implement and that’s not the conversation. “It’s how you take the best of that political debate and use it to build a genuinely real world, effective system for the future.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsLabour PartyConservative PartyJonathan ReynoldsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the judgement aposthe claim brought by Good Law Project fails in its entiretyapos, therefore highlighting the fact this group continues to waste the courtaposs time. He said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. He said: They accept these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of time. Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives. Mr Hancock resigned as Health Secretary last year after admitting to breaching his own Covid guidelines by kissing an aide in his office.

Boris Johnson will chair an emergency COBR meeting today after he cut short a UK tour to deal with the Ukraine crisis. The Prime Minister spoke to US President Joe Biden on Monday night, when both leaders agreed there was a crucial window for diplomacy but the threat of Russian aggression remained serious.More than , Russian troops are massed on the Ukrainian borders. But some units started toto their bases on Tuesday morning, offering a glimmer of hope for a diplomatic solution.  Ms Truss said Europe was teetering on the brink of war and time was running out to find a diplomatic solution. And she said the crisis could embolden other countries with military ambitions. The senior Tory told Sky News: If we saw an invasion into Ukraine, there would be severe costs in terms of a long-running conflict, we could see the undermining of security more broadly in Europe and could see other aggressors around the world see it as an opportunity to expand their ambitions too. This is a very dangerous moment for the world. Ms Truss said the stability of Europe was hanging in the balance. The big risk, of course, isthere is an invasion into Ukraine that will be hugely damaging for Russia and Ukraine. And it will further undermine the stability of Europe, she said. This, I fear, would not stop at Ukraine. This is an attack on the neighbouring states of Russia and other east European countries in trying to undermine legitimacy of them being part of NATO.  She said she was very worried about the situation, adding: We could be on the brink of a war in Europe, which would have severe consequences not just for the people of Russia and Ukraine, but also for the broader security of Europe. There is still time for Vladimir Putin to step away from the brink. But there is only a limited amount of time for him to do that. Mr Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have agreed to continue down the path of negotiations, prompting hopes that there could still be a way to avert war. A Downing Street source said there was some hope that diplomacy could work and Russia could step back.

She added: “All young people deserve access to the services capable of empowering them to achieve a bright future. “We cannot let location dictate these opportunities, and we must no longer expect youth service providers to remain in survival mode as their funding streams continue to be squeezed, or worse still dry up entirely.

Tegan Clarke, now , was just  when she started feeling unwell after starting her degree at London politan University in September . After moving down to the big smoke from Leeds, she partied during her first few weeks at uni just like any other student. But after burning the candle at both ends, Tegan began to feel exhausted.She said: I was tired all the time, so I put it down to exhaustion from moving to uni and leaving home. I wasn’t eating proper home cooked meals and I just assumed I was a bit under the weather.”Recalling her first trip to the doctor, Tegan said they also thought she was just adjusting to being away from home comforts. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereShe said: At first, like me, they just thought it was aposfreshersapos flu,apos which is a term given to these kind of symptoms in new students, but with further tests, they showed I had acid reflux or heartburn.But after revisiting the doctor several times, a visit in November  revealed Tegan had a shockingly high heart rate. “He said he couldn’t really send me home and advised me to go to AE. Once there I had an ECG, to check my heart rhythm and electrical activity and blood tests done, Tegan said. After an anxious wait alone for the results, she received some devastating news. I was on my own when they told me I had a form of blood cancer and that I would need a biopsy to determine exactly what type I had.  It was a completely devastating diagnosis. I burst into tears. While her mind raced, Tegan recalled feeling like sheaposd been given a death sentence. “I have had a lot of family members die from cancer, so I was really scared,” she said. After calling her sisters to tell them the terrying news, they rallied the family to hop on a train down to London from Leeds. Meanwhile, a biopsy confirmed Tegan had non-Hodgkin lymphoma - a blood cancer that develops in the lymphatic system in the body. The student was admitted to St Bartholomewaposs Hospital where her family came to visit.She said: “My family came down from Leeds to visit me in hospital, but I felt very isolated being so far away from home, so the doctors agreed to transfer me by ambulance to St James’s University Hospital in Leeds. “Once there I went onto a Teenage Cancer Trust ward, where the other patients there were all  to  years old. It was really nice to be surrounded by other young people who were going through a similar experience. “The trust really supported me while I was there. I was in hospital for a week and I made a lot of friends with the other patients.” A week after receiving her diagnosis Tegan started six rounds of chemotherapy. Once sheaposd finished chemo in March , she had three weeks of radiotherapy. Having dropped out of university, Tegan had a long wait for the results of her scan to find outtreatment had worked.  Rather than sitting around, she spent the summer of  fulfilling her bucket list - including trips to Disneyland Paris and Amsterdam. She also spent a week in Corfu, Greece, with her family and made sure she accepted invites to every party she could. Finally in September , Tegan was given the all-clear. I couldnapost believe it. I had tried not to get my hopes up so this felt like a dream come true, she recalled. I’d been so focused on the present, but this outcome meant that I could now look to the future. After missing out on her studies for so long, Tegan went to an open day at Leeds Beckett University, and was accepted onto an accounting and finance course days before the new term began. Due to graduate this year, the student is grateful for her health and relieved to be living cancer-free. She said: “I feel like I’ve been given this new lease of le, a new chance to achieve my goals and enjoy my le. However she had a warning for young people who suspect something might be wrong with their bodies - as research from the Teenage Cancer Trust shows awareness of the main signs of cancer in young people is shockingly low.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcTegan said: I would say to anyone who is concerned about their health to keep ing to their doctors until answers are given.

But after lockdown, residents of the block of  flats above the venue have claimed weekends have become a “nightmare” with bosses having revealed that it could become a live music venue on Fridays and Saturdays.And a mum-of-two, Rosie-Mae Deal, toldhow she has been brought to tears by the “ridiculously loud” music that was causing a huge amount of distress to her autistic son.“One night I sat crying in my home knowing I can’t do anything about this ridiculously loud music thumping through my flat, waking my children up, upsetting my little boy, who has autism so is very sensitive to sounds, she said.  “He sleeps in my bed because he’s scared. He covers his ears, he cries, he screams under his covers.” Rosie-Mae said the family should be able to feel “safe and at peace” in their own home. Another elderly resident, Ethelbert Crescent, has suggested the noise is bad due to it not having the correct soundproofing to manage the loud music. Ethelbert, who is in her s, explained that the blaring noise is affecting her health and had prompted her to avoid staying in her own home. When Georgina Powell and her partner moved into an apartment in the same block of flats, , they had been drawn to the idea of the arts hub that they could use on their doorstep.  Georgina said that the concept of the space had sounded “amazing”. But now, she and her partner - whose flat is directly above the venue - have now been forced to move out, and are now paying rent on top of their mortgage. Georgina compared parties held in the flat to the noise held in Fabric nightclub, with the floor vibrating and the couple able to hear “every word to Madonna”. Various noise complaints were logged by the Thanet District Council last year, prompting an application to review the licence to be submitted. According to the councilaposs environment and health team, the venue has not always adhered to their pm noise curfew. More measures were potentially necessary not to disturb the neighbours. However,  letters of support have reportedly been sent in favour of the venue, which some locals have called key to the community in the area. Representatives from eight of the  flats appealing to the council will appear in a council hearing due to take place on Thursday. Faith in Strangers has been unable to comment until a ruling is decided.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

A Blackpool council enforcement officer had caught the driver of the Cinderella horse drawn carriage looking at their phone while carrying passengers.The driver, who was not named, claimed to have been checking the time for the change over of horses according to the BBC Local Democracy Reporting service.But they had their licence suspended for four weeks and were slapped with a warning that the licence could be completely revoked in the event of any future similar incidents. The punishment was handed out at a hearing held behind closed doors by Blackpool Council public protection sub-committee, which heard the driver was also accused of switching lanes suddenly and not having proper lights on.  Members of the sub-committee said they were concerned passengers were being carried at the time of all three offences and the driveraposs actions had potentially caused public safety concerns. Solicitor Allan Cobain, who represented the driver at the hearing, said his client admitted having their mobile phone in their hand to look at the screen. They blamed a lack of familiarity with the vehicle for not having the side lights on, and said the failure to pull into the correct lane quickly enough had not caused other vehicles to brake sharply as claimed. The offence happened in October last year but details only emerged in the minutes of the councilaposs public protection sub-committee.

But a Manchester University study has shown it’s a ­relatively small group of patients who have been piling on additional pressure at surgeries. These “frequent attenders” account for a large proportion of a GP’s ­workload – % of appointments, including ­face-to-face consultations. The findings go some way to explain why it’s so hard to see a GP. Frequent attenders – classed as people having more appointments than % of patients at their practice, have more than doubled their number of clinic visits in the last two decades. The study ran from - and looked at million consultations from .million patients in  ­GP practices. It showed four out of  patients were frequent attenders. Co-author Dr Maria Panagioti, from Manchester University, said: “Frequent attenders also may have special health and social care needs but for a iety of reasons we do not yet fully ­understand how best to meet them.”Consultations with GPs by frequent attenders increased from an average of  in  to  in . But when consultations with other staff at GP clinics, such as nurses, were added in, the average figure more than doubled from  to . To cope with more requests for appointments GPs are using a iety of means, including non-face-to-face, such as telephone and online. It seems the traditional way of patients seeing GPs is being replaced by a new working model where other staff members are using dferent ways simply to cope with workloads. Co-author Professor Evan ­Kontopantelis from Manchester University, said: “This is the first study to show that frequent attenders, the top % of consulters, have largely and progressively contributed to increased workload in general ­practices across the UK over the last  years.” Co-author Professor Aneez Esmail, also from Manchester University, said: “Our findings show frequent attenders account for an increasing proportion of face-to-face consultations with GPs and are responsible for nearly % of consultations fairly constantly over time.” Dr Panagioti added: “But these ­findings may also suggest the increase in multi-disciplinary staff working in general practices is perhaps the only solution for sustaining primary care. “Indeed, the large increase in the general practice workload over the last  years means having extended multidisciplinary teams is necessary to meet a wide range of patient needs through a range of ways such as remote consultations.” Sounds like general practice will never be the same.

The government hopes to announce that an end to all Covid restrictions, including the mandatory period required for self-isolating, will be in place by the end of February.Parliament is currently on recess, but the Prime Minister is due to announce his plan for living with Covid when MPsnext week on Monday, February . Another change, this time to testing, is also likely to be announced. Boris Johnson looks set to unveil the change that could impact Brits up to £ at a time, as the UK looks to learn to live with the virus.So what is the change and why will Brits be charged   Will PCR tests be scrapped  Free PCR tests now look set to be scrapped and could cost people £they want to get their hands on one. The Living Safely With Covid plan is due to be published on February  and may well include the plans to scrap free PCRs.  PCR tests have been vital to determinea person has Covid, as they are more accurate than lateral flow testsand have become a requirement for travel to and from certain countries around the world at ious points during the pandemic. The hope is that LFTs becoming more widely available will mean PCRs will not be so heavily relied upon. Why are free PCR tests set to be scrapped   The Treasury will be hoping to save billions by announcing the end to free tests. Covid figures have taken a downward trend recently. The seven-day average has been falling since January .  However, UK Health and Security Agencywants the government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April and some experts are also concerned that the changes will be taken as a signal by people with Covid that they should continue to mix in public setting, despite having clear symptoms of the virus. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On a clip posted by Matthew Larino there is a message the reads: So apparentlyyou shine a light on your licence some type of anima l will show through...Then a licence is shown held up to a light, showing the shape of a fish, made up of light shining through tiny holes in the card. The video shows a stunned Matthew saying “Get outta town,” before running to get his own drivers licence.  Once he holds his card up to the light, sure enough, you can see the dotted shape of a bear shining through the plastic. The comments exploded with others finding their own secret animals. Yes I had to try it. Connecticut, wrote one commenter, including their licence with a picture of a whale made out of tiny perforations. A buffalo!!! In Oklahoma! said another excited viewer.  “Mine has a turtle, this is the happiest I’ve been in weeks,” said another excited comment. But not all licences have animals, some show a symbol representing that state, or a national tree or flower and some even have an outline of the state itself. Several include the stateaposs national tree or flower, or just a symbol representing the state. For example, Nebraska licences have a cornhusk, while New Mexico features the Zia sun symbol.According to theNational Notary,these distinct images are used as a security feature and are made during the production of the IDs.The site also noted that: These images are usually representative of the issuing jurisdiction.

In the video, which has been widely shared on social media, the gang of “ to ” kids and teenagers can be seen kicking and punching the girls as they lie on the ground screaming. A woman who witnessed the attack, by students from the Bishop Young Church of England Academy in Leeds, begged them to stop their assaut, shouting “leave her alone”.The gang of youths then turned on the bystander who said she ended up with some of the kids “on her” after she tried to intervene in the incident which took place near Arthur’s Rein Park in Leeds.The witness said the ambush involved over  students attacking the girls, who were reportedly thrown into a lake during the assault, Leeds Live reports. The witness described what she saw saying: “They were attacking her and another. I shouted ‘leave her alone’ and ‘what on earth are you doing ’ “I just saw around  to  kids coming towards me but I wasn’t bothered about me, just the young girls. I ended up with some of the kids on me.” She added that it didn’t last long. It has been reported that the girls were thrown in the lake during the assault and Bishop Young Academy has now issued a statement to parents about “poor behaviour happening on the way to or from school.”  The letter signed off by the headteacher Rachael Cole states: “Unfortunately, over the past few days, there have been some of incidents of poor behaviour happening on the way to and from school, and in the evening within our community. Although these incidents involve a very small minority of our students, they have had a negative impact on the local community and the reputation of our Academy. We are working very closely with parents, the police and the local community to address these issues and ensure that our students are responsible citizens who make a positive contribution to our society. “Please rest assured, that any time we receive information about the conduct of our students it is acted upon in the strictest possible terms, even when such behaviour occurs away from the academy. Should our students break the law, we actively encourage you to not only report it to us, but to also report it to the police and we will continue to work with the police to safeguard our students and our local community.” West Yorkshire Police have said they are making enquiries following the assault.They said: Police are making further enquiries following a report of an assault, which is said to have occurred in Dib Lane, Roundhay on  February. Anyone with information that will assist is asked to contact the East Leeds Neighbourhood Policing Team on , or by using the options on the West Yorkshire Police website.

Tiny Hannah is thought to be the smallest baby ever to survive in the UK and was given a  per cent chance of pulling through by doctors. Parents Ellie Paton, , and Brandon Stibbles, , are now finally able to hold the tot, who will stay in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, in Glasgow, until she is big and healthy enough to go home. The couple, from Newmilns, Ayrshire, were warned by medics ‘babies that small don’t survive’ - but Hannah was strong enough to breath by herself.They are counting down the days until Hannah can be transferred to Crosshouse Hospital, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, which is closer to home. Hannah now tips the scales at . ounces and her eyes have opened. Her delighted parents have been able to feed her through a tube - although one of her lungs has collapsed.  The couple are enjoying reading her stories and watching their baby respond as she now recognises their voices. Dad Brandon said: “We have both got to hold her a couple of times. “It’s a completely dferent feeling - you can either pick her up from the incubator or they can bring her over.  “We prefer that, she’s really really small. “Her eyes have opened and she’s pretty aware now. “She was waving at us, and we wave back. We are there all day, every day.” The couple have read her books including Dilly Duckling, and Giraffes Can’t Dance.  Ellie added: “It’s not just good for her, it’s good for us as well. We get to change her nappies quite often as well now. “Because she’s got chronic lung disease there’s a really high chance she will need oxygen when she’s discharged, but she’s done amazingly well.” The couple have yet to see their families, and have not been back to Ayrshire while no relatives have yet met Hannah.

With his lawyers’ help he came across as a debauched, entitled social reactionary from the world of th century princelings that America cast off in . Andrew seemed to believe his rank made him unaccountable. And the aggression of his defence team in the New York civil action brought by Virginia Giuffre made it much worse. There was also a feeling in America that Andrew had already been judged in another court: The one convened by his own family.  Their draconian steps to strip him of his titles and banish him from public duties may not be trial by jury but it rang out clearly as an unequivocal condemnation by those who know him best. That does not, however, pacy federal prosecutors. They still want Andrew’s help in shedding light on the world of sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By his own admission, Andrew had known and regularly met Epstein for two decades. In  the New York-based federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, said Andrew “sought to ly portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” in his investigation but had repeatedly declined to be interviewed. That was bad enough. But when Andrew’s legal team painted Virginia Giuffre as someone compromised by “her own wrongful conduct” rather than as one of the many victims of the depraved Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell menage, it reinforced a certain view of Andrew: That he was incapable of feeling any remorse for believing that he could circulate in that world without being tarnished by it.The Last Queen by Clive Irving is published in paperback by Biteback on Thursday, £..Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She added that she welcomed the Duke of York’s pledge to donate money to his accuser’s charity, but said his relationship with disgraced Jeffrey Epstein had damaged the city’s reputation. She said: “Although it is a relief that Prince Andrew has finally acknowledged and expressed regret for his close association with a convicted sex offender and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, his long delay in doing so and initial response to the charges and Ms Giuffre have been source of deep hurt and embarrassment to many people across the city.  “Carrying a title does create an ambassadorial relationship with that place, and for somewhere with a global reputation, such as York, this is extremely important. “It is to be welcomed that he has now pledged to support the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and it’s victims. “To demonstrate his seriousness in this endeavour, and his respect for those affected by abuse and the people of our city, I would ask that his first act of contrition is to confirm his support for the withdrawal of his ducal title.” Quoting a poll from York’s daily newspaper The Press, she highlighted how % of people in the city who were asked wanted Andrew’s association with it to be removed.  She has previously requested a debate into how aristocratic titles which take their name from a geographical locations are assigned.And she now wants Parliament to pass legislation which would enable people to vote for the withdrawal of Andrew’s title.It was announced on Tuesday the Duke of York and Ms Giuffre had reached a “settlement in principle” in her bombshell civil sex claim filed in the US. Court documents show the disgraced royal will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity, which supports victimsapos rights.Andrew has continuously denied any wrongdoing.Sources claimthe QueenandPrince Charlesput substantial pressure onPrince Andrewto settle his case. By avoiding a potentially explosive civil trial, it is hopedthe out-of-court deal– rumoured to be £million – will stop the scandal causing even more damage to the Royal Family.Andrew has not admitted Ms Giuffre’s allegations that she was forced to have sex with him on three occasions in  when she was  - a minor in US law.

The Duke of York will now pay a figure, thought to be around £million, in order to settle the legal action. He has always denied allegations against him. Now it has been claimed that Andrewaposs mother, the Queen, will help her son in paying the costs. Thereports that some of the agreed cash will come from his mother, with a source saying: Walls were closing in fast. After his deposition, he would likely have been so damaged, no one could save him or agree to fund his settlement.”So how much money does the Queen have and how does she have a vast personal wealth  Here we take a look...The Queenaposs net worthAccording to the  Sunday Timesapos Rich List, the Queen has a net worth of £million.This is £million more than the Sunday Times estimated her net worth to be in . In , the Sunday Times also calculated the value of the entire Royal Family - which they estimated to be billion, which is about £billion.However, working out the Queenaposs finances are far from simple, as there are many restrictions and technicalities on some of the things she has to her name.Queenaposs pots of cash Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .The Queen pays for her day-to-day le using three separate pots of cash - the Sovereign Grant, the Privy Purse and her personal money. The Sovereign Grant is the money the government gives the Queen every year to support her work and is made up of taxpayer cash. The Privy Purse is cash generated by the Duchy of Lancaster - a portfolio of land, property and other assets of about , hectares in England and Wales. It has existed since  to provide an income for the Sovereign – who is also known as the Duke of Lancaster.  But the Queen canapost do what she wants with the Duchy – it is managed and run for her – but she receives all the net profits, which is millions of pounds each year. This is generally considered to be her private income – although some republicans argue that it is money that would go to the Treasurywe didnapost have a monarchyand so should be considered public funds. The Queen voluntarily pays income tax on the profits. She uses the money to pay for private and official expenditure – including meeting expenses of members of the royal family such as Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne. She also uses it for the upkeep of Balmoral Castle. According to one royal expert,the Queen has helped out Andrew with the settlement it more than likely would have come from the Duchy of Lancaster, which is described as the Queen’s private estate”.  Royal finances expert David McClure, author of Royal Privilege: The Queen’s True Worth, said the source of any settlement funds to Andrew is of “tremendous public interest”, and called for the royals to “come clean and say where the money came from”. He said: I just would argue in view of the enormous public interest in it, in view of the fact that Prince Andrew is a public figure, he was in line to the throne, I really think that they should disclose the amount of money and where it’s come from.” Adding that he is “not optimistic” the information will be made public, Mr McClure said: “I wouldn’t be surprisedthey try and not say anything, because there’s a long history of secrecy to do with anything involving the royal finances, but given that it’s a public matter, given there’s so much pubic interest in the matter, I really think for once the royal family should come clean and say where the money came from.” Queenaposs other assets Many of the things Her Majesty owns, she owns as Sovereign on behalf of the nation rather than owning them personally. For example, while she owns the Balmoral and Sandringham Estates personally having inherited them from her father, the official Royal residences - including Buckingham Palace - must be passed onto her successor.This means Prince Charles will automatically own them, but again only as Sovereign, when the Queen dies.The same rules apply to many of the art treasures in the Royal Collection and most famously, the Crown Jewels.

Ms Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, made the claim against Andrew for damages in her home country of the US, claiming she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs friend, to have sex with the royal when she was , a minor under US law. Andrew denies the allegations against him. In a letter submitted to the United States District Court on Tuesday, Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer David Boies wrote jointly with Andrewaposs lawyers to say that the parties had reached a settlement in principle. Court documents show the Duke will make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. Andrew has also pledged to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Here, Royal author and former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond writes that Andrew is tarnished by his friendship with a convicted paedophile. And she notes how it will take more than a charity donation to clear his name... The cost to Prince Andrew of settling his long-running dispute over sexual abuse allegations will not be cheap. But the cost to his reputation is clear. Even though the civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre is over, the road back to official royal status for the Duke of York remains barred forever. It is a cleverly worded statement. The announcement of an out of court settlement avoids any suggestion that Prince Andrew was personally involved in any wrongdoing. But it accepts that Virginia Giuffre is a victim of sexual abuse and trafficking at the hands of the man the Prince once regarded as a useful friend. Ms Giuffre has not won the public apology she was seeking, but neither has she withdrawn her allegations that Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her on three occasions.  It is the Prince who has made the real concessions in this settlement, contritely stating that he never intended to malign the character of the woman he claims he has no recollection of meeting. His lawyers had been sharpening their knives and asserting that Ms Giuffre might suffer from memory lapses. They had raised the possibility of interviewing her husband and her psychologist about her mental health. But now the Prince acknowledges that she has suffered not only as a victim of abuse but as a result of unfair public attacks. Some might think that those attacks largely came from his own camp.  And, in a change of heart, the Prince now makes it clear that he does indeed regret his association with Jeffrey Epstein. In his car crash TV interview on Newsnight, he was asked directly by Emily Maitlis whether he regretted the friendship. “Still not,“ he replied, “and the reason being is that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful.” Andrew has always been an opportunist. He has now been persuaded to take this opportunity to show his support for the fight against the evils of sex trafficking by making a hefty donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity. He has also been persuaded to commend her bravery in standing up for herself.  This settlement avoids the humiliation of the Prince being interviewed next month for up to seven hours under oath about intimate details of his sex le. It also puts an end to the sensational prospect of a Duke on trial in a civil court in the States…with all the attendant publicity and damage to the monarchy. There’s no doubt that he was under pressure from the Palace to bring this corrosive episode to an end. In this of all years, with the Queen celebrating the historic milestone of her Platinum Jubilee, no one wanted any more lurid headlines about sexual abuse. She has already felt obliged to humiliate her son by sacking him from royal duties and stripping him of his HRH title and military appointments. The prospect of seeing him take the stand in an American courtroom was unthinkable.  The bluster of recent weeks, with the Prince saying he would fight as a private citizen to clear his name, was the usual grandstanding in civil cases. Virginia Giuffre was also said to be determined to have her day in court. In truth, the vast majority of these cases are settled out of court, and that was always the likely outcome. Is there any way back for Prince Andrew now that this has been agreed  Absolutely not. The Queen has already assured the smooth transition of the monarchy by expressing her wish for Camilla to be Queen alongside Prince Charles. And the new King will want a streamlined modern monarchy in which Andrew was already surplus to requirements.  He is, of course, a much-loved son and is adored by his ex-we, Fergie, and their two daughters. He will remain part of the royal family into which he was born, and I am sure the Queen will include him in family le. But there can be no public role for him ever again. The fact is that Prince Andrew will forever remain tarnished by more than a decade of speculation about his friendship with a convicted paedophile. As Ms Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, commented about the out of court settlement: “I believe this event speaks for itself”. And in the court of public opinion it will take more than a charity donation and some carefully chosen conciliatory words to comprehensively clear the Duke’s name.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The QueenJennie BondPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince Charles, Prince of WalesNewsnightRoyal FamilyCrimeCar crashes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ukraine has signalled a preparedness to sideline or abandon a desire to join Nato. Sustaining talks, however strained, is better than the alternative.  Prime Sinister The indefensible cover-up intensies as Boris Johnson arrogantly declares he will keep secret his responses to the police questionnaire on No lockdown parties. Voters deserve to know his excuses for attending boozy bashes when his Government was busy imposing draconian laws on ordinary people, punishing more than ,. If the PM claims he’s stupid, clueless, accident-prone, unfortunate or above the law, the nation has a right to see it in black and white. Johnson’s lies and reckless approach are why he is in a deep hole in the first place and why a law-abiding nation is absolutely furious.

Elle Vickers, , and Ellen Baldwin, , believe they were injected with an unknown drug at Fiction nightclub in Hanley, Stoke. The friends say they have no recollection of the night after blacking out - but claim they woke up with terrying symptoms and concerning injuries in intimate areas.Elleaposs woke up covered in bruises and scratches, with what appeared to be a puncture wound in her thigh, she told StokeonTrentLive.The teen, from Cheadle, said: Both of us blacked out and have no recollection of the vast majority of the night. My friend was taken to Royal Stoke by the police. I was alone for the rest of the night with no memory of what could of happened to me within this period of time. I woke up to find myself covered in bruises and scratches down the inside of my thighs and feeling the worst I have ever felt. I rang  to get advice on what to do. I was informed that  would ring me back when someone became available. At the point I made the call I was in a cold sweat, could not hold my own head up, my throat was closed making it hard to breathe and my legs and inside my mouth are covered in cuts and bruises. Ellen says she cannot recall what happened, but was told police had taken her to the Royal Stoke University Hospital amid concerns for her well-being.  She was discharged within half an hour, but the Keele University students ed twice to hospital later that day after seeking advice.Now Staffordshire Police have launched an investigation into the spiking incidents, which Elle and Ellen allege happened in the early hours of Saturday after arriving at Fiction at .am on February .Detailing her own recollection of events, Ellen said: From what I’ve been told I collapsed outside the nightclub. My friend then got the attention of two police officers, she and my other friends shared their concern to the police that I had been spiked. They shrugged it off, they did not take any names or details, they just bundled me in the back of there car with my boyfriend and dropped me off at AE. I do not remember leaving Fiction or any of the events that night. When we got to AE I couldn’t even hold myself. They put me in a wheelchair and covered me in a blanket. I wasn’t able to hold my head up and I was barely communicating.Within half an hour of being there I was discharged and told to come back sober. I believe they didn’t check me over or my body. It wasn’t until the next afternoon I found the puncture wound from the needle in my upper thigh. The next day I had spoken to my friend Elle who had a similar experience. She can’t remember huge chunks of her night and woke up with bruises all over her body with no recollection of what happened to her. Concerned, both Ellen and Elle ed to AE but were told to see their GPs instead to undergo blood tests After being passed from pillar to post, Elle says she was finally told to go to a walk-in health clinic.The frustrated pair say they have been passed around by the NHSin the hours and days following their nightmare night out.Ellen added: After speaking to the police and  they told us to go up to AE again so they could help us and get checked to make sure we were protected against diseases that could’ve been on the needle and protected against what was injected in us. We were there for  minutes before they turned us away, we didn’t even speak to triage they also didn’t even look at the puncture marks. They just said our GP should look at it. We then called our GP to then be told we need to go back to AE because the GP cannot take bloods from us and that it is also a police matter because it is an assault. After going back to AE for a third time we again were told that they could not do anything and our GP should sort it out. After again speaking to them they just gave us a call slot to speak to someone at a health centre about taking our bloods.  Me and Elle understand that the NHS is under a lot of strain and we know that we are not going to be able to know what was injected in our bodies that night because it is now too late. But we feel that from being turned away so many times from the people that are meant to help us and care for us that we are over-reacting or making it up and we were just too drunk. We are two teenage girls who have been injected by a needle with something we are not aware of and not one person in the NHS has asked to see the wound they have just passed us around. All me and Elle want is someone to look us over and check we are okay. Warning others to be on their guard, Ellen added: Please everyone be safe and be aware of your surroundings because it’s not just spiking through drinks anymore. Fiction says it takes all reports of alleged drink spiking very seriously and is offering anti-spiking devices to customers. In a statement, the nightclub said: “Everyone should feel safe on a night out, and they should feel safe in our club. We work hard to create a welcoming, inclusive and safe environment so that all our guests can enjoy a fun night out and will do everything we can to protect this right. “While there have been no proven cases of injection spiking in Hanley, as a responsible late night operator, we take all reports of this nature very seriously.Our teams are fully trained on the issue and have the support of our onsite medics, we operate our ‘We Care’ policy and support the ‘Ask Angela’ scheme. We are offering anti-spiking devices to all of our guests and operate % searches on entry.We also have extensive CCTV coverage throughout the venue and security teams wear bodycams and will pass on footage to the Police to help with any investigation.We would encourage anyone who sees suspicious behaviour, or suspects they have been a victim, to seek immediate assistance from a member of staff or security, who are trained to help and who also have the support of our onsite first aiders. We would also encourage them to contact police and seek medical advice, so that any allegation can be properly investigated.” Staffordshire Police are now reviewing CCTV. A spokesman said: We were called shortly after pm on Saturday following reports of a suspicious incident. At around am that day, officers working on Operation Safer Nights had assisted a -year-old woman to present at hospital after she reported vulnerability, following attending a nightclub in Hanley. She is being supported by specially-trained officers at this time while inquiries continue. Officers are currently reviewing CCTV footage of the area at the time of the incident and ask anyone with information to get in touch.Anyone with information is asked to call Staffordshire Police on Facebook, Twitter, or call , quoting incident number  of February .

As Storms Dudley and Eunice are set to batter the UK this week, weaposve taken a look back at some of the most dramatic weather events to hit the nation.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.The Great Smog -  Dubbed as one of the most severe air pollution events to ever affect the capital, The Great Smog hit London in December of . Lasting four days before clearing, a thick layer of smog smothered the city - making visibility dangerously low.In fact, around , people died as a result of the pea-souper and , more were made ill by the event. According to the Met Office, the smoke-like pollution was so toxic it was alleged to have choked cows to death in the fields.The Great Smog of  may seem more like a pollution issue than a weather event - but itaposs actually a combination of both. Winter had gotten off to a very cold start with plunging temperatures and snowfalls across the region. So, in a bid to keep warm and avoid frostbite, the people of London naturally lit their coal fires to stay toastie. Usually, this wouldnapost cause an issue as smoke rises into the atmosphere where it disperses. However, an anticyclone, ie. an area of high atmospheric pressure where the air is sinking, was hanging over London. As a result, the warm smoke leaving the chimneys, as well as all of the pollutants pumping out of factories, got trapped - creating the ideal conditions for radiation fog.Britainaposs first sting jet -  A sting jet is basically a small area of very intense winds. Now, weaposre not talking about those blustery days where you have to hold your brolly from popping out, or your hat flying away. Sting jets are usually winds that exceed mph. Britainaposs first officially-documented experience with the phenomenon occurred in October of  and has been classed as one of the most damaging events to impact parts of the UK. Southeast England was battered with winds reaching a staggering mph - reportedly killing at least  people and knocking over millions of trees. The then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd went as far as describing the sting jet as the worst night since the Blitz. Scientists have since warned that the number of storms with exceptional wind speeds, like Britainaposs first sting jet may hit the UK, may doubleglobal warming continues to accelerate.How many of these weather events have you lived through, and how many can you remember  Take part in the survey below to have your say. Similar wind speeds to the sting jet were recorded on January  in . However, the Burns Day Storm affected a signicantly larger area than the  disaster - sweeping across southern Scotland and creating severe gales across many parts of Wales and England. Millions were left without electricity as the hurricane wind wreaked havoc on power supplies and phone lines - and fallen trees caused major disruptions to public transport and roads. Commonly referred to as Cyclone Daria, the Burns Day Storm also killed more than double the number of people than the sting jet that came three years before as it struck during daytime hours when millions were going about their day-to-day business. After raging through the UK, the violent storm, which began as a cold front over the Northern Atlantic Ocean, tracked east towards Denmarks and caused more deaths across Europe, including the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as floods in Germany.The hottest day in history -  Brits moan when itaposs not sunny and then moan even more when it is. But the heatwave of  was unbearable for even the most dedicated sun-worshipper. In Kent, recorded temperatures hit a stling .°C on August  - which remains a record-high to this day. And Brits werenapost the only ones sweltering that summer - with many European countries affected by the lack of rain and record-breaking temperatures. And while that temperature may not seem alarmingly high for some countries - the August heatwave was actually associated with a large short-term increase in mortality, particularly in London. Environmental think tank The Earth Policy Institutionactually claim that , people died as a result of the Europe sizzle - and warns that such deaths are likely to increase. “Though heat waves rarely are given adequate attention, they claim more lives each year than floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes combined,” the EPI said. “Heatwaves are a silent killer, mostly affecting the elderly, the very young, or the chronically ill.Boscastle flood -  Nestled on the north coast of Cornwall, England, the small village of Boscastle was savaged by a catastrophic flood on August  in . It started with heavy rainfall - more than mm in two hours to be precise - which consequently resulted in two river banksbursting.According to the BBC, this resulted in around two billion litres of water gushing into Boscastle - causing thousands of pounds worth of damage and sending residents into a frenzy.Cars were swept to sea, trees uprooted and buildings were damaged. However, nobody was killed and the village received a hefty donation from Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall, to help rebuild the area. £. million has since been spent on a flood defence scheme - which includes making the river channel wider and deeper to be able to hold more water.Storm Kyrill -  Cyclone Kyrill was a low-pressure area that rapidly developed into a surprisingly violent windstorm that battered Europe. It originated in North America on January  and travelled across the Atlantic, hitting Ireland and England just two days later. Hurricane winds with gusts of up to a shocking mph then moved eastwards towards Poland and the Baltic sea - even managing to reach parts of Russia. An estimated , homes in England suffered power outages after pylons were damaged from the wind, and nearly  flights were cancelled at Heathrow Airport due to health and safety concerns.  people in the UK loss their lives from the storm - including a two-year-old boy who received severe head injuries and died in hospital after a wall fell on him. Across Europe, around  fatalities were reported, many from driving accidents caused by fallen trees or collisions.St. Jude storm -  Named after the patron saint of lost causes - St. Judeaposs storm saw winds touching mph pound the Isle of Wight as well as parts of Wales and England. Heavy rainfall also lashed areas of the UK on October  and  in  before crossing the North sea and reaching Denmark, where wind speed resulted in a record-high of . mph. Five people were killed from the storm - one couple losing their lives after a tree fell onto gas mains, causing an explosion. A -year-old boy was also swept out to sea. In comparison to the storm of  - five million fewer trees were destroyed and the total damage was nearly £billion less. Still, the gusts caused chaos to public transport and left , homes across the country without electricity.Hurricane Ophelia -  Forming in the Atlantic Ocean itself on October , , Storm Ophelia strengthened into a hurricane as it headed across the Azores, an autonomous region of Portugal. While it started to weaken on its journey towards the UK, it was still powerful enough to hit Ireland days later with record gusts of over mph recorded in Cork. Sadly, three people in Ireland were killed from the unprecedented storm and more than , people were without power. The arrival of Ophelia also brought Saharan dust to parts of the UK - which resulted in a hazy sepia-toned sky. Across parts of Devon, residents reported a strange burning smell which were attributed to forest fires over in Spain and Portugal.British Isles Heatwave -  June  was an extremely dry month across central and southern England - with London recording little or no rain for a staggering  days. It is this drought-like condition that contributed to drier soil, which can subsequently lead to increased temperatures. Similar to the heatwave of , Brits were subjected to scorching temperatures exceeding °C - resulting in a widespread drought, crop failures and a number of wildfires. There were fears of over , deaths during the heatwave - and warnings from experts about how intense temperatures will become more frequentglobal warming continues to accelerate.The heatwave was also blamed for record numbers of people admitting themselves to AE, as health bodies shed concern on how the NHS was under severe strain.

Two low pressure systems were originally expected to bring spells of very strong winds and potentially snow between Wednesday and Saturday, but Brits could feel the impact of sooner than thought after forecasters moved forward the warning period.Storm Dudley, which carries a danger to le weather warning, will likely start and finish earlier than expected, according to the Met Office, ahead of Storm Eunice moving in, bringing strong winds and potentially some snow for parts of the country on Friday.Gusts of up to mph are set to batter the whole of the country due to a jet stream which was originally forecast to hit on Wednesday and Thursday under a yellow weather warning.  But this has now been upgraded to a more severe amber warning bringing le-threatening gales to parts of Northern Ireland, most of Scotland and the north of England. Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said an active jet stream is driving low-pressure systems across the country, both of which are likely to cause some disruption.Winds are expected to be strongest on exposed coasts and hills of Scotland, with -mph possible further inland. This is applicable to southern and western Scotland, the north coast of Northern Ireland and northern England, where the strongest and most disruptive winds are expected.  Winds are expected to ease through Thursday afternoon and evening. The stormy conditions will barely have subsided before the next low pressure system, named Storm Eunice, will track across central areas of the UK. According to the Met Office, further impacts are expected from disruptive gale force winds - with - mph winds expected inland.  Heavy rain is expected to come alongside the system as well and there is a potential for some signicant snowfall over hills in the Midlands and further north.National Highways Head of Road Safety Jeremy Phillips encouraged drivers to check the latest weather and travel conditions before setting off on journeys, and considertheir journey is necessary and can be delayed until conditions improve.“If you do intend to travel, then plan your journey and take extra care, allowing more time for your journey,” he said. “In high winds, there’s a particular risk to lorries, caravans and motorbikes so we’d advise drivers of these vehicles to slow down. “Drivers of other vehicles should be aware of sudden gusts of wind which can affect handling and braking, and give high-sided vehicles, caravans, and motorbikes plenty of space. In the event of persistent high winds we may need to close bridges to traffic for a period, so please be alert for warnings of closures and follow signed ersion routes.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Met OfficeSnowWeatherStorms\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

There is also the possibility of widespread travel chaos including a good chance of power cuts and disruption to transport services. The amber warning states: Injuries and danger to le is likely from large waves and beach material being thrown onto coastal roads, sea fronts and properties. While there is also a wider yellow warning for strong winds, the more serious amber is in place from pm until midnight and covers a large belt across the middle of the UK, including regions north of Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire and south of Perthshire in Scotland. Forecasters have said residents in this region can also expect heavy showers throughout the afternoon and snow on high ground.  A yellow warning for wind, which could disrupt public transport and power lines, is also in place from pm on Wednesday, covering all of northern and central England, most of Wales and southern and central Scotland. This warning is in force until pm on Friday, and expands to cover Northern Ireland from Thursday. Met Office forecasters have said the conditions are caused by Storm Dudley which will move across the northern half of the country from Wednesday night into Thursday morning, before Storm Eunice follows it. Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin has warned people to brace for heavy rain and ever-strengthening winds. He said: Itaposs going to be a windy day throughout with those winds continuing to pick up through the afternoon and the evening.  There will be some snow on the hills across Scotland, but itaposs the rain and more particularly the wind weaposre concerned about in this storm system on Wednesday. Itaposs likely to cause transport disruption and dangerous conditions by the sea. Storm Dudley is expected to bring gusts of up to -mph on exposed coasts and hills of Scotland, with -mph possible further inland. Meanwhile, Storm Eunice is predicted to bring heavy rain and possible snowfalls on high ground from the Midlands northwards.  Where snow does fall, the high winds are likely to create blizzard conditions, the Met Office has said. Motorists have been urged to drive carefully, while electricity supply firms have issued warnings following the widespread outages in northern England and Scotland which followed storms earlier this year. Temperatures are milder than usual for the time of year on Wednesday, with highs of C predicted in London, C in Cardf, C in Belfast and C in Edinburgh. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Rain and hill snow over northern Scotland clearing, then dry and bright for a time. Further rain, some heavy, sweeping eastwards, followed by sunny intervals and squally showers across central areas. Windy with gales in places, locally severe later. Tonight: Very windy through the evening with rain clearing, leaving clear intervals and blustery showers, these frequent in the north and falling as snow over hills. Thursday: Sunny spells and showers, most of these in the north and west, where heavy at times. Wintry showers in the north. Winds easing through the day. Rain into southwest later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Storm Eunice is likely to bring a spell of disruptive strong winds to southern areas with snow further north. Remaining very unsettled with rain and strong winds over the weekend.

Today that isn’t the case. Today was brutal - a cruel reminder of just how nasty the English language can be.The word has left people desperate. Taking to Twitter, user @PNKNWHlTE wrote: “The word today being caulk…like who  was scared.”@mi_shmash went one further, saying: “Seriously what does caulk mean.” A third, @Official_N, chose to abandon sentences altogether, simply writing: “Caulk  Caulk  Iaposm sorry... CAULK!!!!! As the dust settles on one of the worst commutes since offices reopened, the confusion of the Wordle community has left a huge question hanging over the UK. What on earth does caulk mean  What does todayaposs Wordle word aposcaulkapos mean   According to the revered Cambridge dictionary, caulk, a noun, is defined as: “A substance used for filling in the gaps around the edge of something, for example a bath or shower.” Similarly, the ever-popular Collins Dictionary provides a definition for the word in the form of a transitive verb. It says: “If you caulk something such as a boat, you fill small cracks in its surface in order to prevent it from leaking.” Providing an example, the dictionary states: “Heaposd offered to caulk the windows.” So there you have it - caulk is the sealant that goes around the edges of your plumbing appliances in your house or,you’re lucky, the windows of your boat. How to play viral game Wordle  Wordle is a thrillingly simple game, which is no doubt part of the reason it is so popular. Every day a new five-letter word gets released for you to work out. You only get one word per day. Players have six attempts to work out what the word is, with each attempt providing clues about the correct place a letter must go. While you could guess the word in your first go it is extremely unlikely and instead, the skill comes from working them out in as few attempts as possible.  If you place a latter in the correct place it will highlight green so you know it needs to go there again on your next attempt. If a word gets highlighted yellow then the letter is in the word but you have placed it in the wrong place and will need to move on your next effort. Be warned though, because you will only get six attempts to guess the word, so choose your guesses carefully.

Nick said: You might not think that your door takes up a lot of space, butyou’re in a small area every inch of space really does help. Sliding doors can work in any room and look stylish. They are a good way to separate out spaces without completely shutting off an area, for example in the kitchen, they’re great when hosting parties or social events. Haven’t got much floor space  What can you put on the walls  Some spaces have extremely high ceilings, and although you might not initially think that it can help with space-saving, it can. If you’re smart about your decoration and storage ideas, you can create an aesthetically pleasing and practical area.  Add sturdy shelves where suitable and use these for decoration and storage. For example, why not store your mugs and plates on a high shelf in the kitchen  If you’re working from home still and have a desk area, invest in a desk that has shelving upwards. That way, you’re not imposing on the floor space as much. Nick went on to say that having light coloured walls can help a room seem spacious, and adding the odd stripe can accentuate the effect. He continued: Of course, you don’t want a completely white house or flat that looks clinical, but you do want an airy feel to your room. If you don’t want to add permanent stripes to your space, you can play around with rugs. If you do feel brave and decorate with stripes, don’t go overboard as too many patterns in a small space can end up leaving a space feeling cluttered.

The Mach . missile is known to NATO as the SS- Stone, but the Kremlin names it after the king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon - considered one of the greatest military generals in history. It can be fired at a tremendous range without warning and is capable of obliterating vital targets as a precursor to a lightning assault. It comes as the West attempts to determine whether Moscow is actually withdrawing troops from the Ukrainian border - orit is a Vladimir Putin bluff. Weapons like the Iskander would allow Russia to strike a sudden attack and at a substantial distance from the border, where US President Joe Biden claimed last night up to , Kremlin troops lay in wait. The missile uses advanced guidance and warhead developments and is a major threat to a multitude of targets, reports Forbes.  Its explosive warhead can weigh from -kg and comes in bunker buster, smart submunition, thermobaric and EMP versions. It even allegedly boasts a stealth coating, meaning it is almost invisible to radar, with one iant said to be able to manoeuvre continuously in flight to evade defences. The Iskanderaposs precision has also supposedly been measured at an incredible - metres, a feat normally only pulled off by laser-guided weaponry.  Added to this, Russia has spent a decade developing a reconnaissance drone which can work alongside the missile, feeding it target data.As the Mirror reported yesterday, Russia is also working on a monster -metre long submarine to go at speeds of  knots. The countryaposs state-owned design bureau for marine engineering, Rubin, has unveiled the project, with the sub to be multial after the government reduced its defence budget due to the Covid pandemic.  The vessel - the size of about  London buses - is a modied version of the companyapossmodel which is already in development. It comes as Russian war games continue unabated in multiple locations, including Belarus, as the Kremlin keeps its forces in a high state of war readiness. Defence ministry sources on Wednesday told newspaper Izvestia that units and subunits of the rd, nd and th Motorised Rle Divisions are being sent back to their permanent bases after the “partial completion of large-scale exercises of the Russian army and navy”.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

Before joining farming, I had no idea the community was so heavily impacted by bad mental health.#If one person reads about Mind Your Head and decides to reach out or to check in on a loved one, that’s a step in the right direction.#Please, be that person and start the conversation.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it - with  minutes remaining to end the match as a contest, giving the score line a harsh look from a Pupils# perspective, having competed well with their lofty opponents for an hour of the contest.And while such defeats are always tough for a team#s players and management, they still offer valuable on-field experience for the young Pupils players in the squad, as they adjust to a higher, more physically demanding level of football in the West of Scotland FL.The Pupils have nine fixtures left to play this season – five at home and four away – and are on the road again tomorrowagainst second-placed Finnart FC, at Springburn Park.

spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough,

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for spring by carrying out basic maintenance.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, this month there are signs of the approaching spring, with bulbs appearing and wildle waking up as light levels and temperatures increase.There#s plenty to do indoors this month to prepare for the season ahead.Outdoors, as the garden comes to le, it#s time to prune shrubs and climbers, such as wisteria, as well as evergreen hedges.CAPTION:If one of your gardening new year resolutions was to plant a tree, now is the time to make that a reality.

avoiding fines.Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council transport spokesperson, said: “For those who don’t have a safe place to park and charge at home, seeing live, on-street status in their

Haddington for premises on the town’s Mitchell’s Close.The group, founded  months ago, supports those in the Haddington area who are struggling financially to feed themselves and, potentially, their families.Since being formed, the organisation has helped about , people,  per cent of them children.Volunteers have put in more than , hours, with more than  cats and dogs also being fed.Pat Lemmon, who co-founded the group alongside Linda Mitchell, said that they moved into their new home shortly before Christmas.She said: “We encouraged the community to become more resilient by supporting its most vulnerable people in the ward.“Thanks to an initial donation from the community council we had start-up funds and, because of the brilliant relationship we developed with the Bridge Centre, staff and the Lamp of Lothian, we were allowed to operate from there.“From February to December, we gradually built up our name in the area through leaflet drops, social media and dferent appeals, and have been involved in Christmas, Easter and Mother’s Day appeals.“Then, in November last year, the referrals went through the roof – the hardship of ‘heating or eating’, and in some cases trying to make sure their kids were having a semi-decent Christmas, at the expense of the adult’s health and welfare.“Also round about this time, we realised with groups ing to The Bridge Centre we would have to find alternative premises.“The search began to find new premises and Mitchell’s Close became available.”Discussions are already under way between the group and East Lothian Council for retrospective planning permission at the new premises, previously used by a cake-making company, for a change of use and the installation of a handrail.East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, reported earlier this year that it had recorded its busiest ever month since opening nearly a decade ago.In December, close to , people were helped by the county charity.Mrs Lemmon told the Courier that the Lammermuir Larder, which supports people from throughout the Haddington and Lammermuir ward, had also been busy.She said: “In an ideal world, there would be no need for us.“What has also developed is we see ourselves as being the go between.“Occasionally, we have people we have built up trust with and they like to talk on the doorstep and we can help signpost them on to other agencies that can help.“We don’t just drop the food at the door, we build up a relationship with some of them as well.”People can be referred to the Lammermuir Larder by a range of professionals, as well as by the person themselves, by simply filling out a referral form.Mrs Mitchell stressed: “We are not just supporting people who are unemployed – we are supporting people that are working and still not able to feed themselves or their families.”The Lammermuir Larder has received support from a number of businesses and community groups in the town.Financial donations, as well as collections of food, have been made to the good cause.The group continues to look for donations of items, including small jars of coffee, diluting juice, tins of hot dogs, tuna and potatoes.Donations can be made at a range of businesses, including Kevin Watt Butchers in Haddington and the town’s Co-op store on Hopetoun Drive.For more information about the group, go to

Many of the women interned there, though, aren’t mad at all, but committed by their families for the sake of convenience. Geneviève has nursed there faithfully for  years, but her dedication takes a knock when she discovers that -year-old patient Eugénie, who claims to be able to see and hear the dead, is actually telling the truth.Every year, the Parisian elite attend the voyeuristic Mad Women’s Ball at the hospital, and Geneviève reckons the event will be the perfect cover to sneak Eugénie out to freedom.Mas highlights the camaraderie among the inmates, and her depiction of Salpêtrière is reasonably even-handed – for some patients, it’s a refuge from a much worse fate outside – and in this sumptuous tale of injustice and defiance, she endows the asylum with all the vividness she brings to her characters.BUILD YOUR HOUSE AROUND MY BODYViolet Kupersmith Twenty-two-year-old Vietnamese-American Winnie arrives in Saigon with the intention of reconnecting with her Vietnamese heritage whileteaching English.

Were the white-toothed, perennially cheerful brothers too nice and squeaky clean to have had a pop le worth writing about What of the music, Jay  How did the boys from Utah feel when Donny’s arrival onto the stage dragged them from the pop- rock world into the land of ‘bubblegum And what of the dynamic of The Osmonds  How do you keep seven egos in check, decide who holds the power  And there’s the religious factor. In the s and s, The Osmonds were rarely described without the adjective Mormon attached.We begin however with a chat about how the musical came about. “Five years ago I was thinking of writing a book about our story when a producer friend of mine said he thought the story should become a musical,” says the band’s drummer. “And he said it should be told from my perspective. Now, I’ve never written a musical before. And we’d been approached several times over the years with offers to create a musical based on The Osmonds. But the timing felt right and he encouraged me to go it alone.”Jay Osmond met with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s producers and five years later the story has been completed. He recognised immediately, however, it couldn’t be just a series of links to connect the  songs performed in the show.“I wanted to show people the dferent sides of The Osmonds. People knew we had a tight-knit group but no one knew the reason for this. I wanted to reveal what made us tough [dad George instilled this] and how we managed to get over the obstacles.”The story begins in  when the brothers were hired to appear on the Andy Williams Show and took America by storm.We flash forward to the s and then back to the s, which suggests the script is far from simplistic.Osmond also had to trace the group’s evolution, from iety act to pop rockers, to chart toppers. The shting tones gave the band longevity but must have created schisms  “I love that question because it sums up the reality of conflict exactly. It was hard, because we played as The Osmonds, and then Donny joined and we became his backing band.“It was hard for people to categorise us. You know, we’ve put out  albums over the years, we’ve sang and danced and done it all, but because of that you have identity issues.”In the same yearwhen Donny came out with Puppy Love, the brothers released the rocking Crazy Horses. And when you add to that little Jimmy Osmond’s Long Haired Lover From Liverpool, the team were covering all the bases, but radio station playlist schedulers found them hard to pigeon hole.Jay Osmond knew that the show, which features two sets of Osmonds,had to address that dilemma.But he also had to deal with their personal lives, holding relationships together, all the time remembering they were a family unit, as well as a band.“We had a voting system,” he reveals, with the hint that democracy wasn’t always smooth.And there was the Mormon tag.

We’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘Wow, what a boy band!’ And they’re talking of a band that was in the charts  years ago.”Indeed. The Osmond’s story is tale of longevity. And fun. And some very good songs. But with some searching into how it was all possible.There’s little doubt that Wyoming-based Jay Osmond has loved the family band journey, even coping with all the competition that came their way, such as the Bay City Rollers. “The boys were great,” he says with real generosity of spirit. “The Jacksons were our buddies.”His voice becomes a little more serious. “You know, the hardest part of my career has been putting this musical together, so that it’s real and heartfelt.”The reviews suggest the drumming Osmond has pulled it off. And it’s a chance to showcase his own talent.He adds “I’ve always been a team player, never one to go up front but this has changed that. And I feel great about it.”The Osmonds - A New Musical, Kings Theatre, Glasgow, runs until this Saturday .

Now Scotland has the possibility of producing an equally large and skilled set of workers whose experience of renewable energy systems, notably offshore wind farms, which will produce career opportunities here and much further afield. Let’s not throw away this huge opportunity that we have.With regard to the cost of fuel, as mentioned by Leonard Maguirethe increase in cost is not the fault of the renewable energy companies, it is profiteering by the major oil and gas companies. A windfall tax on these companies could help alleviate the dficulties that many people are having heating their homes. In the mid to long term these dficulties will be overcome by relatively cheap renewable energy. In addition, it will be no longer possible for foreign countries, and indeed the big oil companies, to literally and metaphorically hold us over a barrel and increase prices once renewables become our main source of energy.And,your correspondents cannot see the signicance of reduced carbon footprints and preventing climate change, let them note the serious storms that we have been having recently which may well be a portent of increasingly dficult weather problems coming our way.So, come on Scotland, let’s lead the world in renewables the way we did in offshore oil and gas.John Palfreyman, Coupar Angus.* IT is dficult to see how a reduction to Scotland’s minuscule . per cent of global emissions could make any dference to our climate, and I suppose Lorna Slater and her party would not be able keep the lights onoil production stopped as they intend. If Ms Slater actually believes what she is doing is worthwhile, then she is fighting on moral grounds.

Whose freedom are we talking about exactly Freedom in the purest sense is only possibleyou live in a bubble, alone, or on a desert island where your actions have no bearing or result on others.Now, people are entitled to their own opinion, as long as it is not coercion to their own world view. Presumably, since these freedom fighters think that most people dont die, they dont mind many more filling hospital beds unnecessarily. And,they are one of those needing hospitalisation, they dont mind sacricing their hospital bed for others and suffering or even dying horribly in their own home, without causing a fuss. Or,they find their hospital bed is filled, when they need an urgent operation for an unrelated matter, they dont mind waiting in pain.Tellingly, this protest is more about themselves, not others.Trevor Rigg, Edinburgh.TELL THE PENICILLIN BACK STORYI HEARTILY endorse the wish expressed by Alastair Clarkthat you and other publications will commemorate the centenary of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming.The story is well known: Fleming had ed from a holiday, and was tidying up his laboratory, disposing of old petri dishes and their contents. However, he was struck by seeing that one dish, in which had contained a culture of a very virulent micro-organism, had been contaminated by mould, and this mould had markedly disrupted the germs growth.Most peoplewould probably have thought How interesting\" and simply dunked the dish into the bucket of disinfectant. Fleming appreciated the signicance of this finding, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.He thought that this discovery could be used to identy germs, but its development into a drug followed a rather convoluted path.It was not until  that the therapeutic aspects of penicillin began to be explored in Oxford by Howard Florey, from New Zealand, and Ernst Chain, a refugee Austrian Jew . Florey and Chain cultured the mould, and extracted penicillin from it, successfully treating patients for as long as they could maintain supplies, but they were working on a very \"cottage industry\" basis.In order for penicillin to become widely available, it was necessary to enlist the help of the US pharmaceutical industry, which could produce it on a large scale. Even so, they had much dficulty, because the penicillin molecule is fastidious.Thus, I hope that any journalistic production would, as well as praising the pioneers, spare some effort to celebrate the contributions made by many others which must have saved countless lives, and prevented much disability.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.ON NEUTRAL GROUNDPERHAPS it might be an idea to revert to some previous post-revolutionary gender-neutral terms for everyone: for example, Citizenor Comrade .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Our camp neighbours were from Germany and asked us about the flag as they did not recognise it. We were very proud to explain where we came from and how new the flag is to the Isle of Skye.#I also work seasonally as an instructor at ACE Target Sports, Portree and we have photos of playing cards customers have won at ACE and taken with them around the world. I have taken a couple of ACE#S with me, taken photos and sent them back to Mattto add to the album! So, we are flying the flag for ACE as well.#Melanie and Bob are due to arrive back on Skye next Wednesday #All in all, an epic trip, never to be forgotten and full of amazing memories. Even the eye-wateringly cold Antarctic plunges we have both done down here!# she addedThe couple#s flying of the Skye standard will no doubt be a proud moment for young islander Calum Alasdair Munro from Kilmuir. The youngster’s design was selected as the official flag following a competition which lasted  months, attracted  entries and received more than , public votes.Calum Alasdair raised the flag at an official and socially distant unfurling ceremony at the Nicolson memorial in August ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CALMAC-DOLANS-100TH-4-scaled.jpg","title":"centenary sailor dolan caps his 100th birthday in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident in An Acarsaid care home in Broadford, Skye, ‘Dolan’ as he is known, was asked by staff what he wanted for his special birthday He was proud to wear his answer at Armadale Pier, where he was greeted on the MV Loch Nevis by master and fellow Lewisman Iain Mackenzie, who lives in Kyleakin.As well as the cap, Dolan was also given a bag of CalMac goodies. February  at Flesherin, Point, Dolan worked with his dad making Harris Tweed before getting an apprenticeship with a bakery in Stornoway.However, his ambition was always to join the Merchant Navy, which he did in  in Glasgow.Not long after, he joined the crew of the British-India ship SS Manela which sailed to South Africa during World War Two.Dolan said: “I also went to America, Canada and Australia while at sea and could be away for up to two years at a time, but it was always great to get on the boat in Glasgow and head home to Lewis.“I ed to Lewis for a time after the war and spent many happy years living with my sister Mary Ann down in Back.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1606908037252.jpg--remaining_northern_ireland_coronavirus_laws_lifted.jpg?1606908041000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220214newsremaining northern ireland coronavirus laws lifted","story":"The remaining coronavirus restrictions and face-covering regulations are to be scrapped, Health Minister Robin Swann has confirmed. They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.

Credit: Liam McBurney PA WireFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen the books are written and history students look back on the early s, they’ll be forgiven for thinking they’re studying science fiction instead.Had a man with a sandwich board been shouting “the end is nigh” outside Belfast City Hall in February , it would have looked like he had a point. It was the end of the world as we knew it.Read MoreNiamh Campbell:OpinionImportant day forto some kind of normalityNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidance“The end is nigh” means something dferent today, and we can all breathe a little easier.There is no doubt that without the restrictions we would be looking back on a lot more lives lost to Covid than the official figure of over ,.For many, their last moments were spent alone. For those who mourned, they watched from afar. That was one of the hardest restrictions to bear.Pulling our bedroom curtains closed on Monday, March , , we did so wondering what sort of world would await when we opened them the next morning.The UK death toll stood at , three of them here.St Patrick’s Day had already been cancelled, giving the first hint of what was heading our direction. Then lockdown started.Farewells were said to those in nursing homes as the doors closed to visits. Businesses shut, save for those deemed essential.The queues outside supermarkets started. Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation. The mental state of people was a constant concern.Sure, it’ll be over by Christmas, we said in . We said the same in .It wouldn’t be this placethe ending of restrictions didn’t bring with it some added confusion and doubt.With the Executive unable to meet due to the lack of a First and Deputy First Minister, the issue became a legal matter.In years to come there’ll be plenty of stories told starting with the words: “Do you remember the time ”Those history books  years from now will be filled with the facts and the figures, the bumps in the road, the scandals of those in public office.But we’ve lived with it all, lived through it all, and come out the other side.We can all see a little more clearly now.The dark clouds have been replaced by that hopeful rainbow we’ve been teased with several times over the past two years.There does come a time when we have to learn to live in the world as it is, as close as we can to the way we did.We might not be quite stepping into the brightest of bright days.Restrictions will change to guidelines and recommendations.There will still be many content to take the precautions they feel they need, and everyone should move forward at their own pace.Hopefully the last two years have taught the majority of us to appreciate the things in our lives that are most important to us — our family and friends.Le moves fast. Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years onCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveMost ReadStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Do I have to wear a mask Watch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCrown Court trials that were halted by pandemic set to resume this weekBusinesses annoyed work from home guidance remainsNorthern Ireland’s Covid rules scrapped and replaced with guidanceLatestUltimate goal is to have a bed for every domestic violence victim – McEnteeBafta nominee Ann Dowd: America has lost its wayAverage price of some household items ‘has surged by nearly % since ’Why is the UK suffering a cost-of-living squeeze and what action is being taken Oisin McConvilleOpinionGAA’s unsavoury scenes are threatening to get out of control… the very ethos of Gaelic football is being challenged,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That in my mind makes a nonsense of the whole thing.”He argued that on-the-ground businesses such as cinemas suffer from rating regulations, but online services don’t, and compared them to gambling laws, which mainly apply to in-person adult gaming centres, but not online casinos.“I’m a board member of the UK Cinema Association and we#ve asked the BBFC to reconsider changing the rating to a A,” he said.“The reason I go to Belfast City Council is to try and convince them to address this sooner.“It will still have a  rating, butyou’re with a parent or responsible adult, then you can watch it, which I feel is a fair and reasonable compromise.”Mr McAdam further noted that cinemas in the Republic of Ireland will be showing The Batman with a A rating, meaning viewers in Northern Ireland could simply travel over the border with their children to watch it there anyway.Belfast city councillor Brian Heading said Mr McAdam’s “request has been made and the committee will look at the evidence and make a decision” based on it.“I watched the trailer last night because I was actually hoping to bring my grandson to it,” he told BBC’s Good Morning Ulster radio show.“He’s only five, but is a big Batman fan. Only looking at the trailer, it’s a bit dark. Certainly his mother and father wouldn#t allow me to take him anywhere near it.“Over the last couple of years children have had new experiences that a lot of us never had. Hollywood should be producing something that children can go and see and have a positive message,” he added.Belfast City Council has never changed the rating of any cinema releases historically, but movies here have been banned from being shown in the past.Conservative religious and political leaders from both sides rallied to block the erotically charged Last Tango in Paris when it first debuted in , and Monty Python’s Le of Brian was banned by Belfast, but authorities in Derry bucked the trend and granted it a licence in .Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years on PremiumMark BainOpinionThe end is nigh, and thankfully the world is looking brighter than two years agoCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveMost ReadStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Do I have to wear a mask Watch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandOisin McConvilleOpinionGAA’s unsavoury scenes are threatening to get out of control… the very ethos of Gaelic football is being challengedWinds pick up ahead of two storms set to batter the UKCinema chain launches bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanJordi Murphy’scould see ‘exciting’ back row combination for Ulster Rugby but coach stresses strength in depthTyrone are set for show of defiance over dismissals against Armagh as former referee appeals for ‘politics’ to be taken out of GAA disciplineLatestKey questions answered about Covid- jabs for five to -year-oldsQueen holds in-person audience day after Andrew settles sexual assault lawsuitUltimate goal is to have a bed for every domestic violence victim – McEnteeBafta nominee Ann Dowd: America has lost its wayAverage price of some household items ‘has surged by nearly % since ’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s about breaking down barriers and accommodating and facilitating their culture.”Mr Wells believes the Irish language is “not simply an expression of a cultural aspiration” and claimed it is part of an “ongoing political campaign”.“We all know Sinn Fein made it very clear that Irish is crucial to the republican struggle. Irish has allowed itself to be cynically used as a political weapon by one political party.”Mr Mulgrew responded: “Those who see ision in this issue are those who see the Irish language as being isive, and that says more to me about those people, who look for ision.“Can we please move away from pointing the finger at each other’s traditions “I would assume that a lot of these students [living in the residence] would be Irish language students who would be taught in Irish anyway.”Sinn Fein has been contacted for a response to Mr Well’s comments.The proposals have faced further criticism from the TUV, and the Student Orange Society at Queen’s, along with its student and alumni lodge, who issued a joint statement claiming the proposals were encouraging “ision”.Joshua Patterson, Worshipful Master of Queen’s LOL , said that universities should be a shared space between students of dferent political and religious backgrounds but the residency scheme “encourages ision, further isolating those from a Unionist background in University le and wider society.”Responding on Twitter, the Cumann Gaelach group said the inspiration for the scheme had actually been taken from the Orange Order.The message read: “Despite their depressing view on our new scéim chónaithe, when we began plans for a living scheme, one of the first examples we looked at was ‘Croom Elbow’, the Orange Society’s own university living scheme.”Referring to information on Queen’s University LOL  website, the Croom Elbow property is used by the lodge for meetings, events and also by the Orange Societies of both of Ulster’s universities.There are also said to be vacancies for tenants at competitive rates each year open to members of the institution and others.An Cumann Gaelach added: “Everyone owns the language. Our proposed living scheme will be a welcoming environment for all, it will help normalise the language and soften such sharp views.”A Queen’s spokesperson said the university is “currently considering the development of a residential language scheme that will be available to students studying degrees with languages or a language element offered by the university”.This initiative is based on similar programs currently available in other universities to help promote and develop a deeper understanding of languages and linguistic ersity,” they added.​“Students who apply for this type of accommodation option will be selected in accordance with the eligibility criteria set out in the current University Allocation Policy, and must have already secured an accommodation place.No institutional decision has yet been made on the request, which will follow our standard governance, approval and equality screening processes, following the development of a robust proposal.”Related topicsJim WellsQueen’s UniversityMore On Jim Wells PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Donaldson is gambling with his future and the Union PremiumSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategy PremiumAction is clearly needed on climate change, but farmers fear they’ll reap a bitter harvestWatch: ‘I’m taking hit on my own after being ousted in blaze of publicity’, says DUP MLA Jim WellsDUP selection process: How does it all work Most ReadStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Do I have to wear a mask Watch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandOisin McConvilleOpinionGAA’s unsavoury scenes are threatening to get out of control… the very ethos of Gaelic football is being challengedWinds pick up ahead of two storms set to batter the UKCinema chain launches bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsJordi Murphy’scould see ‘exciting’ back row combination for Ulster Rugby but coach stresses strength in depthLatestWhy is the UK suffering a cost-of-living squeeze and what action is being taken Oisin McConvilleOpinionGAA’s unsavoury scenes are threatening to get out of control… the very ethos of Gaelic football is being challengedNato sees no sign Russia is pulling back troops near UkraineCharles to visit Wales as he emerges from isolation after catching Covid againCalum Best ing to TV with football series for BBC Three,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Patrick’s sister Charley was their surrogate and they used a donor egg.It was a long and expensive process for the family, with heartache along the way after a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. There were also delays caused by the pandemic.Shortly before Wren was tucked into bed at the family home, Patrick and Jon told this newspaper about the emotional moment Charley offered to carry their baby five years ago.Patrick, who had assumed that fostering or adoption was their only choice, said: “We didn’t really think this would ever be an option for us. “We’d heard of people going to America for surrogacy but had heard it could cost , . That was something we could only dream of. “When we were talking about it, people would say, ‘I would love to do that for you, but...’.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up A few weeks after Charley had mentioned in passing that she would help, she sat the couple down to say she was serious.Jon recalled: “From that point, it felt like a possibility. She told us her thoughts on it, how her family and her partner felt about it and how it would be for her children.”The couple had considered using an egg donor clinic in Kiev but were encouraged to advertise in a local newspaper.They were stunned when they received a reply after a week, with the donor stipulating the egg should go to a gay couple. They subsequently attended a clinic in Belfast, with all family members having to go through counselling.Patrick said: “It was actually a really good gateway to open up questions that you might not have wanted to ask.“Charley [was] telling her children what way we would do things when she had the baby. “[We were asking], ‘Whatthere’s something wrong the baby  Who would decide what happens ”Jon said the couple were also prepared for facing intrusive questions about who the father of the baby was.“Who would ask that  But I’m sure plenty of people will be thinking it without saying it, so how do you manage people’s expectations ” he asked.Patrick added: “But the way the counsellor put it, why would we tell anyone who Wren’s ‘real’ daddy was before she knew “But it doesn’t matter. We’re both her daddy regardless of what has happened. “There’s loads of dferent ways to make a family. Just because ours is a little bit dferent doesn’t make it any less of a family.“It also prepared us to tell people that it wasn’t a very nice question. And a lot of people did ask, ‘Whose sperm did you use ’”Jon added: “It’s a natural reaction, but we can tell people the boundaries about that. I have to say it was nieces and nephews that were the easiest to tell because they just accepted it.”Patrick said that Charley’s then three-year-old daughter was quick to correct anyone who congratulated her mum for becoming pregnant.He explained: “She would turn and say to them, ‘She’s not pregnant. That’s Jon and Patrick’s baby’. Charley would be killing herself laughing.”After the “heart wrenching” pain of losing the first pregnancy, Patrick faced dark timesHe recalled: “I was in turmoil some of the times, but when you look back, it was all just washed away when Wren was here.”When the couple announced the new pregnancy, their families were delighted. Jon said: “I had never seen our parents and siblings cry with that kind of joy — they couldn’t believe it.”The day of Wren’s birth was a “surreal” experience filled with hope but also concern.But they had little reason to worry because after Wren was born just before am, the new family was at home together by dinner time.Jon said: “On that drive home and going into the house, you’re thinking, ‘Right we’re supposed to know how to look after this baby’.“It was a lot to take in, but it was amazing at the same time to know that she was ours.” Jon and Patrick are sharing their parenting story on their Instagram page.

If they don’t want to wear it, that’s up to them. “At the start, I would’ve been a bit like, ‘Why are you not wearing your mask ’ Now, as long as I’m doing it, I don’t mind what other people do.” On the other hand, Stephanie Crilly and Minnie Brown, from Ballymena, were glad to see the back of face coverings.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Personally, I don’t think masks are hygienic. You find them lying around the streets all the time,” said Stephanie . “I just don’t think people are using them correctly. I think it’s much better that now it’s everyone’s own preference.”The pair also stressed that they would be adhering to social distancing, which they feel is more important in controlling the spread of the virus.Englishman John Addy , the assistant director of the Open University in Ireland, joked that while he was “not a pessimist normally”, he would be wearing a mask because it “is a socially responsible and caring thing to do”.“I don’t think this pandemic is over yet. We don’t know what’s coming around the corner. I also quite like not getting colds, which I haven’t done in recent years, so for the time being I’m going to carry on,” he added.Echoing his sentiments, John Murray , from north Belfast, said he would “definitely” keep wearing a mask after recovering from Covid last Friday, following  days of positive tests.He explained: “At the end of the day, you’re protecting yourself and protecting others from youyou’ve got the infection.“It’s all very well taking away restrictions, but after working in the health service for over  years, it’s about what happens next. At the minute, the present version [of the virus] is not killing too many people, but who knows what’s round the corner.

The vaccines are clearly doing their job — while it is still possible to catch or transmit the virus after vaccination, the risk of this happening is reduced.More importantly, they are stopping as many people from becoming seriously unwell.Q Will restrictions  Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up  A It is impossible to rule out completely another lockdown or theof some restrictions at some point in the future. We have already seen evidence that Covid- can mutate at any time and experts have warned there will be further iants, which may result in a more infectious and virulent strain of the virus that requires extraordinary measures to keep people safe. No-one can predict when this could occur — as Professor Martin McKee from Independent Sage said: “It could happen next month or in  years.” However, the vaccines are succeeding at breaking the link between infection and serious illness and death, while work is constantly ongoing to improve the effectiveness of the vaccines and find better treatments for those who do become gravely unwell. Q Why is it important to continue to use face coverings A The evidence is clear — Covid- is an airborne virus and face coverings provide a barrier that helps to reduce the risk of transmission. The more people who wear face coverings, the more effective they are, and not only do they protect the person wearing them, but they also reduce the risk of onward transmission.As restrictions are lted, an increasing number of people who are considered vulnerable to the virus will want, or have to,to work and other public environments, and they will be better protected from becoming seriously unwellpeople around them are wearing face coverings. Q Will GP surgeries reopen to the general public A It is incorrect to say that GP surgeries have been closed throughout the pandemic. Rather, they moved to a dferent way of working with the introduction of the phone first triage system.This enabled family doctors to assess whether a patient required a face-to-face appointment, as well as ensuring they didn’t have Covid symptoms before coming into the building.Most recent figures show % of phone consultations result in face-to-face appointments.The system was actually already in operation in a number of surgeries prior to the pandemic and given the pressures on primary care have increased further without a rise in GP numbers, it will remain in place as it is considered the best way for an overstretched workforce to cope with demand.At the same time, it is likely face coverings and social distancing will be necessary in GP surgeries to reduce the risk to vulnerable patients and staff.Equally, restrictions in hospitals are likely to remain.Most ReadStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Do I have to wear a mask Watch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandOisin McConvilleOpinionGAA’s unsavoury scenes are threatening to get out of control… the very ethos of Gaelic football is being challengedWinds pick up ahead of two storms set to batter the UKCinema chain launches bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsJordi Murphy’scould see ‘exciting’ back row combination for Ulster Rugby but coach stresses strength in depthLatestRussian invasion would ‘shake the foundations of international order’ – No Cabinet Office asks Met ‘partygate’ photos will be publishedKey questions answered about Covid- jabs for five to -year-oldsQueen holds in-person audience day after Andrew settles sexual assault lawsuitUltimate goal is to have a bed for every domestic violence victim – McEntee,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its official announcement is expected later on Wednesday.– What is going on with the disparities across the UK In this case, it appears that the JCVI guidance has been given to ministers but not yet been announced.A bit of political wrangling in Westminster could be to blame and it may be that Whitehall officials wanted to announce the decision on offering jabs for five to -year-olds when then set out their Living With Covid plans next week.Now Wales and Scotland have jumped the gun on the announcement, it has forced the hand of Westminster officials and the JCVI decision is expected to be published on Wednesday.Announcements from ministers in England and Northern Ireland will follow.– Can you tell me more about this “paediatric formulation” Children aged five to  will be offered a much lower dose of the vaccine – lower than that offered to adults or children aged  and over.They will be offered a  micrograms dose compared with  micrograms.The MHRA said the vaccine is given as two injections in the upper arm.

Hugo Melville and Kyle Patterson worked well up the right side before crossing the ball across the circle only to intercepted by PSNI.Both teams were able to win short corners throughout the quarter but neither were able to convert their chances.lsquoHinch were quick to attack and go looking for the elusive goal as the third quarter commenced, with Adam Dodds sending alovely cross circle ball to Ross Connolly, who narrowly missed the goal with at the back post.Craig Harkness and Zack Patterson kept PSNI at bay on both wings with super tackles although Ballynahinch knew they had to go for it and pressed higher up the pitch leaving space at the back.lsquoHinch lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell was able to deny the opposition by making a one on one tackle before clearing the ball out of his circle.However, PSNIrsquos counterattacks continued and they were able to win a penalty stroke after the ball found a lsquoHinch foot on the goal line.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs. Mairead ed and performed like she never had been away.Senior youth worker Yvonne Maguire congratulated everyone connected with the production mdash the cast members, production team, friends of Patrician, parents, and families for supporting members, children and young people.She extended a sincere thank you to Mairead for standing in at the last minute and also paid tribute to Shona, who had worked so hard in preparing for the performance and regrettably did not get the opportunity to star.A recording of Shona singing will be available on Facebook.The principal cast members were: Mairead OrsquoHare , Aaron Mullan , Aedan OrsquoHare , Annie May OrsquoHare , Eamon OrsquoHare , Eva Bailie , Tyler Fung , Zoe Gaines .Chorus, dancers, monkeys, trees and crows: Caitie Cunlfe, Caragh Moore, Conal McDowell, Ella Grace Cunlfe, Emily Douglas, Georgia Savage, Jack McDonald, Katie Fegan, Kayleigh Rogers, Lilly Boyd, Maria Rooney, Megan Megahey, Molly Boyd, Molly Madine, Oisin OrsquoHare, Poppy Baggley, Poppy Woodall.Patrician Youth Centre would also like to thank the following staff team and friends for making the production possible: Caitriona Smyth, Anthony Frew, Bridin Wells, Eamonn Hanlon, Charlie Hanlon, David McBennett, Melissa Poland, Paddy Watters, Mark Hassett, Anna Murray and Teresa Sweeney.Thanks are also extended other team members and the centre trainee leader membership who supported the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Sea.jpg","title":"Drive for better sea swimming facilities  ","story":"A SERIES of measures to improve the safety of sea swimmers in Newcastle have been suggested to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority has been asked to address the needs of the increasing numbers who enjoy swimming at the resortrsquos harbour.Council officials met recently with Mournes councillor Laura Devlin who is working to secure improved access to the water and the needs of those who enjoy cold water swimming.Cllr Devlin said while sea swimming has always been popular in the resort, there is an increasing number of people taking to the water as a result of Covid which prompted many people across the district to be more active.She said Newcastlersquos Harbour Heritage Association is bringing many people who use services at the harbour together to provide them with a ldquounied voice with the group including representatives of the sea swimming community.ldquoCold water therapy is now an established activity and the coronavirus pandemic will unfortunately have a lasting impact on mental health, continued Cllr Devlin.ldquoThis type of therapy is seen as a successful line of defence and even treatment for many, notwithstanding the superb physical benefits and enjoyment that cold water swimming brings.Cllr Devlin says there are many activities at Newcastle harbour which can sometimes lead to a congested slipway, explaining that there are ldquosignicant safety concerns when swimmers, boats and jet-skis are in the water at once.The local councillor, who met recently with council officials and was joined by local sea swimmer Fiona Davey, has also highlighted parking problems at the harbour which she said are ldquocontinuing to deteriorate.She continued: ldquoI have also consulted with The Harbour Heritage Association and we agreed a list of issues that need to be addressed which the local authority which is considering improvements to the water access point on the harbour side of the Rock Pool or at the Back Shore.ldquoAn extension of the ramp leading to the water is also required to allow for disability access, while a handrail to assist people entering and exiting the water as well as hooks for clothes and storage, and a seating area for changing is also required.Council officials have also been asked to provide buoys near the pier to section off the area for those jumping into the water and sea swimming in general.Cllr Devlin also highlighted the need for height markers on the pier wall in order that those who jump into the water will know the depth, explaining the water depth can be an issue during the summer months.Council officials have also been asked to provide distance markers, so swimmers know how far out they are.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThis is a flavour of our asks and really is just a starting point. I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment. At long last we are to get these light, he said.After meeting Roads Service officials, Mr Biggerstaff also announced progress on a number of other projects in the Saintfield area.He said the provision of a footpath along Middle Road is to go forward to the Departmentrsquos forward planning section, as well similar provision on the Ballynahinch Road, Saintfield, as far as Ballymaconnell Road.Mr Biggerstaff said he had also been assured that a footpath extension from Lislane Park to the new build on the Listooder Road, taking in the primary school area will ldquodefinitely happen this year.The Ulster Unionist councillor has also asked officials to carry out a study into a serious flooding problem during periods of heavy rain at Carsonstown Road Killybawn Road.NEWCASTLE ndash Down councillor, Mr John Ritchie, has claimed that the Eastern Health Board consultation process is the ldquokiss of death for Mourne House.In a strong address to the Eastern Health Council attacking the closer plan for Mourne House, Mr Ritchie said that in his experience consultation rarely results in a change to such a proposal.Mr Ritchie claimed the unit of management has looked at the Mourne House scenario from a narrow perspective and he voiced concern about the future of the elderly people in the outlying parts of the community.It was the local councillor who asked for the Mourne House issue to be put on the Council agenda for Thursdayrsquos meeting and he dominated the  minute discussion.During his address Mr Ritchie suggested the implementation of a two-year programme to deal with the renovations and the building could then be used as a base for a community care programme.Mr Ritchie explained that Mourne House first came to light in the dying days of the last Eastern Health Board when the policy and planning committee considered a plan for the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management.The proposal included reducing the number of beds to  and developing Mourne House as a base for a community care package with respite care, a  place day centre, and meals on wheels.Mr Ritchie said there were a whole range of suggestions which the Board felt made a ldquovery attraction option.CLOUGH ndash The Presbyterian congregation in Clough held a thanksgiving service on Sunday to bid farewell to their  year-old church hall which is being replaced.The hall which was built in , is being demolished to make way for a new hall which will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.The services was conducted by the Rev Robert Craig, church minister, who researched the origins and construction of the hall at the turn of the century.The hymn, psalm and ure reading were the same as those used at the opening service.The ious organisations which used the hall over the years were remembered, including the Scouts and Guides, Boysrsquo and Girlsrsquo Brigades, the Girlsrsquo auxiliary, and the badminton, bowls and table tennis clubs.The congregation also remembered the many services and church socials which were held in the hall.In his address, Mr Craig pointed to the strong links between the current congregation and that of a bygone age.He said many of the original families still reside in the Clough area and belong to the congregation.Mr Craig said the congregation is still industrious and is currently busy erecting and paying for the new hall.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league. We work hard every Tuesday and Thursday night and itrsquos a credit to our manager, Michael Carvill, for the shape hersquos pulled us in to.Kilmore: C Turley, J McCarthy, M Stewart, J Larkin, G Kennedy, B Walsh, J Smyth, N McCarthy , J McKinney, A McGrattan, E McGrattan.Subs: C Magee, M Monan, M Carvill.Yellow cards: C Magee, A McGrattan, J McKinney.Comber: A Topping, M Gibson, L Walker, B Porter, R Whittle, S Moore, B Nelson, S Hanna , D Wilson, M Tumilson, G Keenan.Subs: S Fleck, C Gillan, K Gaw.Yellow cards: S Moore, C Gillan, B Porter, S Hanna..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Knockevin in £75k funding initiative  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special Schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association has unveiled details of an ambitious pound, fundraising initiative.The school has bases in Downpatrick, Dundrum and Castlewellan, with the parent and staff group hoping that the ldquoenchantment project will raise vital funds to purchase essential outdoor play and learning equipment.In addition, some of the pound, will be used to meet school bus running costs and other essential items at Knockevinrsquos three bases.Announcing details of the new fundraising initiative, the parent and staff group said pupils are in need of ious items to help combat social deprivation as a result of the ongoing pandemic.ldquoOur children may not always have the same opportunity for social inclusion as those in mainstream education, but to be able to provide them with an outdoor space they can safely and comfortably enjoy together which is fully accessible and tailored to all their needs would be a dream come true, said a spokesperson for the group.ldquoOur children and young adults are most deserving of this. and, as with all specialist equipment, a large price tag is included and we aim to hold as many fundraising activities and events as possible to ensure that we reach our goal.As Covid restrictions continue to ease, the highly acclaimed special school will be able to hold its th anniversary at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel on September , with entertainment provided by the Booze Bros and Finbarr Keaveney the compere for the evening.ldquoWe are looking forward to getting together again to celebrate all that has been achieved in the past  years.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it.

As we emerge from the pandemic, more people will choose to visit the resort where there are exciting plans in place to provide even more for things for people to do and see.ldquoNewcastle and many parts of the wider district boast some of the most spectacular scenery anywhere in the world and the one thing that people can be assured of when they visit is a warm Irish welcome. ldquoCllr Clarke said that over recent years, investment to overhaul the promenade and the Main Street through the heart of the resort has paid a handsome idend.ldquoWhile the resort enjoys many international visitors, Newcastle is also a top destination for day-trippers which provides the townrsquos economy with a signicant boost and helps safeguard many jobs, he said.ldquoWe have the Mournes, the sea, forest parks, golf courses and nearby Murlough which all add to the great package Newcastle has to offer.ldquoThe calibre of cafes, bars and restaurants are top notch and it is no surprise that the resort is noted for the high level of its hospitality services. These all add to the experience that the town provides.Cllr Clarke said while Covid had a major impact on the tourism industry, with spring and summer on the horizon, Newcastle will be ready to offer the warm welcome to visitors that the resort is noted for.In addition, he said the fact that Newcastle is regarded as one of the top friendliest visitor destinations is testament to the efforts of so many people, from tourism providers to local businesses and residents to a raft of statutory organisations, including Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoIt is tremendous that the collective efforts and ard work of so many people has been rewarded with the people who come to Newcastle voting it one of the most friendliest places they have visited..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Owl.jpg","title":"Rare barn owls return to  nest at Finnebrogue estate  ","story":"RARE and vulnerable barn owls have ed to nest at the Finnebrogue estate, near Downpatrick.There are believed to be fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls in Northern Ireland, but their population has been given a much-needed boost with the discovery of a new nest site.The Finnebrogue estate is nestled along the banks of the Quoile river with an expanse of  acres of mixed farm land with half given over to the environment.In January last year, bird boxes were placed around the farm in the hope of attracting breeding barn owls over the winter.Following the use of thermal imaging in April, a pair were discovered nesting in one of the boxes.Commenting on the exciting find, Mark Sandford, Finnebrogue farm manager, said: ldquoHaving only placed nesting boxes up in , it took no time for a barn owl pair to settle. This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population. The wet and extremely hot weather meant that most of our barn owl nest sites failed, so we were thrilled to hear this news.ldquoLuckily, this pair couldnrsquot have chosen a more sympathetic farm to set up home with wild bird cover, meadows and mature hedgerows providing plentul foraging habitat and food for barn owls to thrive.She continued: ldquoWith fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, farmers and landowners play a key role in securing their future.ldquoBy working together, we can help protect precious nest sites, monitor these beautul birds and provide help and advice on owl-friendly farming.The chicks were kindly ringed by David Galbraith, a licenced volunteer ringer from the British Trust for Ornithology .This will generate important information on the birdsrsquo survival, productivity and movement - and is non-invasive as the birds remain sleepy during the process.Barn owls are legally protected and can be sensitive to disturbance, soyou find a nest site, please leave it alone and get in touch with Ulster Wildle.Tell-tale signs to look for include distinctive whitewash pings, feathers and regurgitated pellets of bones and fur. Any information provided is strictly confidential.If you are a landowner and think your land is suitable for a man-made nesting box, or you would like advice on owl-friendly farming, contact Katy Bell at Ulster Wildle on    or email barnowls@ulsterwildle.org.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12262744.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Along with people from the area I immediately began digging at the rubble to free those trapped underneath. We were then joined by members of British army patrols who also tore at the wreckage. Mr Donaldson says that the RUC helped in the rescue.

Mr Donaldson stresses that Paddy McGurkthanked the RUC for their help in the rescue. I know Paddy was thankful afterwardsto all who helped but Paddy was buried under the rubble and when rescued would have been immediately taken to hospital. He would have been unawares as to his surroundings and also who was present. It was also pitch dark with only the lights from army and ambulance vehicles helping the rescuers. I don’t know how long I stayed there but I can honestly say that I didn’t see any RUC. To me Mr Donaldson’s letter reeks of whataboutery in a reverse psychological way. At a time when the RUC has been put in the gutterby the ombudsman’s reportI think he attempts to shine a halo of light on a completely discredited force at the expense of the McGurk’s atrocity and it’s victims. Let’s not forget that the RUC were quick to discredit the victims even before they were identied. The RUC lied when it stated that the bomb was inside the bar. The RUC victimised the victims. Mr Donaldson reveals that the RUC officer brought home pictures of the dead of our loved ones and left them in an unsecure place to be found by anyone, in this case a child, which begs the question who  shared these images and for what purpose  Again remember that the RUC was spreading lies about our loved ones at this time. Recently we have learned of security force members using the personal items from victims of Ballymurphy as spoils of war. We also know of the montages of innocent people have in the past been over to paramilitaries by the security forces. Why were pictures of my mother Kathleen and the other victims in the house of the policeman to whom Mr Donaldson refers  What  did he and his colleagues bring home  Does this still happen today  Finally I would ask Mr Donaldson that in any future reference to victims that he please study the circumstances of their deaths .Sam Irvine, Belfast BTFty years ago Northern Ireland was in the early phase of three decades of killings that never needed to happen——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Mr Murphy says it is an insult to describe the discrepancy as sectarian but it is not surprising that many football fans will interpret the dferent treatment in that way, particularly when the party defending the stadium decision is so reliably tribal and so reliably opposed to proposals that unionist politicians hold dear.It is appalling that the £ million earmarked for sub-regional stadia is not progressing.It is a huge setback for clubs such as Coleraine FC, which have waited so patiently for improvements, and which had drawn up feasible plans for them.As the IFA CEO Patrick Nelson has said see our back page, local football needs investment.Mr Nelson points out that the sub-regional funding was included in the  New Decade New Approach deal to restore Stormont.The only part of that deal that a Conservative and Unionist government intends to rush through is the part that Sinn Fein demands, relating to the gaelic language.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It cannot be reformed it must go. Any unionists who do not believe me, need only look at the nationalist position on the protocol. They wholeheartedly support it because it promotes a united Ireland and a broken United Kingdom. Second, vocally declare their opposition to it. Indeed, all pro-unionists need to shout their opposition from the roof tops. And third, cooperate with other unionist parties to ensure unionism wins a thumping majority of seats in the May elections.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Abandoning those elections in protest against the protocol is not an option. Nationalists and Westminster would both sell such a move as unionism accepting it has lost popular support. They would take the opportunity to set the protocol in stone. Indeed, anything short of a thumping victory for unionism would be similarly promoted. Votes cast for nationalist parties in May will be sold as votes for the protocol. If the nationalists win there will be no ditching or even ying the protocol. It will have been confirmed. There is meant to be a vote on the protocol in Stormont in . There is only one poll that matters, the forthcoming elections. The poll for and against the protocol is already upon us. If nationalists win now, the poll in  will be academic. A victory for nationalism will result in their next pushing for a border poll. In their shoes that is exactly what I would do. I would cite victory as proof that there is now popular support for a united Ireland. There is only one policy which matters in the May elections: what is your position on the protocol  Everything  is of subsidiary importance right now. And anything less than total opposition to it would takes us closer to a border poll and a united Ireland. We are where we are because successive British governments, particularly the current administration, have turned their back on Northern Ireland. When it came to Brexit, Boris Johnson had no qualms about throwing the province under a bus to deliver his faux exit from the EU. Even now, after more than a year of damage from the Irish Sea border, Johnson refuses to acknowledge the constitutional threat posed by the Protocol. He says it is a technical problem one that could be resolved by the EU being pragmatic. His naivety is deliberate and disingenuous. He does not want to face the problem and he does not need to face it. The thing which matters most to Johnson is remaining in office and there are no votes for him in Northern Ireland. He will not be coming to our rescue. The responsibility to save our union falls to pro-unionists in Northern Ireland and their leaders.Make no mistake,unionist parties do not win big in May, we will face a border poll as soon as this year. No unionist party could surely want such a thing. Now is therefore no time for weakness or party politics. Unionist parties must set aside their dferences and work in union for our union. We need a Grand Alliance of Unionism. Doug Beattie, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister carry the hopes and expectations of pro-unionists not just in Northern Island but across the British Isles.• Ben Habib is a former Brexit Party MEP——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We opened in the middle of things before a second lockdown – it was a harsh time to open a shop but hopefully it’s going back to normal now.”Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he wanted to get to a position where there was no need for any Covid- guidance.“We look forward to a time that we can remove all restrictions, and all guidance becomes a thing of the past,” he said yesterday.“But the pandemic is still going on, there are still people dying, there’s still people contracting the virus. And so there has to be a degree of caution in relation to that.”Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed on Monday that all legal restrictions in the Province would be replaced by guidance from yesterday.Mr Swann, who tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, was advised by the attorney general last week on the potential legal complications of him replacing Covid regulations with guidance amid the current political crisis in the Province.But the lting of Covid- legal restrictions should not be viewed as “freedom day”, Stormont’s chief scientic adviser said yesterday.Professor Ian Young urged people to continue to wear face masks in certain public settings, even though it will no longer be a legal requirement.“When something changes from regulation to guidance it doesn’t mean that our behaviours need to change, or indeed that they should change,” Prof Young said.“I think most of our population are acutely aware of the dangers and risks which Covid has brought, the huge harms that have been done.“We all want people to get back to living as normally as possible – wearing a face covering in appropriate settings doesn’t stop that.”He added: “I would absolutely not use the term ‘freedom day’. This is not freedom day.”Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill, meanwhile, welcomed the change.“After nearly two long years, the hospitality industry will be relieved that they can begin to trade without pandemic restrictions limiting the viability of their businesses,” he said.“We must have full focus on rebuilding consumer confidence and supporting the hospitality industry as a key driver for the wider economy.”He continued: “The lting of the remaining restrictions, including mandatory passes at nightclubs and recording customer details, will hopefully signal a major turning point for the industry and see theof the thriving industry we once had which contributed over £bn annually to the local economy. “We want to see local customers ing and visitors from where with the opening of greater tourism opportunities. That buzz has been missed. “Now, attention must turn to the plan of action on how to best rebuild and revitalise the industry to ensure that it s to its former position as a signicant employer and economic generator. “Through a dedicated hospitality strategy, innovative plans and actions can be implemented which will help hospitality regrow, and help create further jobs and opportunities for the sector as we emerge from the pandemic.”Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said: “We can now reopen our economy and accelerate the recovery of our High Streets.“However, we are disappointed that the statement does not include a clear commitment toto the workplace. Safely reopening offices and workplaces is not only vital to boost footfall for our high streets, but also for our economy and ing our society to normal.”He added: “Northern Ireland needs to catch up with other parts of the UK with its -to-workplace message.“Retail NI want to see the Executive establish a working group to produce a clear and co-ordinated plan for the safe and timelyof public and private sector staff.”Northern IrelandConor MurphyRobin SwannBelfastColin Neill  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularFormer UUP chairman asks when party ‘moved away’ from DUP-TUV position on transfer votes ‘Chilling warning that stopped me selling explosives to the IRA’ - ex-gangster John Lawson tells how he escaped a le of brutality and crimeNorthern Ireland Protocol could see a wide range of new regulations imposed on NI, says committee of MPsUUP rejects DUP-TUV election deal to ‘maximise unionist votes’ in Assembly electionRuth Dudley Edwards: Doug Beattie’s engagement policy gets a boost from AllianceMost PopularUnderwear for men UK : boxers, briefs and y-fronts from Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Armani and Nike best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandBest Valentine’s Day gts for her UK : romantic gt ideas she’ll love, for we, girlfriend, or friendsRoyal Mint releases commemorative £ coin to mark  years of FA CupBest sports bras UK : best high support, shock-absorbing exercise bras, from Lululemon, Freya, and Nike                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeFormer economy minister Paul Frew accused Sinn Fein’s Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey and Finance Minister Conor Murphy of making “sectarian decisions” as he claimed they were treating one project dferently to the other.Mr Murphy responded by describing Mr Frew’s comments as an “insult”.“Neither the GAA or the soccer fraternity are sectarian,” he said.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe law changes on Monday, March , removing the legal defence of reasonable punishment and opening the possibility for anyone who smacks a child to be prosecuted for assault.The Welsh Government passed the law change two years ago, seeing off opposition in the Senedd to win a vote - on what was described as a “landmark day for children in Wales”The government said the law change would help “protect children and their rights, and give them the best start in le”. By banning smacking, ministers argue children in Wales are now given the same protections from assault as adults.Physical punishmentis \"not a necessary part of disciplining children\" and \"doesn’t help children learn about self-control or appropriate behaviour\", the Welsh Government advises, adding that such punishments can hurt children and give them the message violence is an \"appropriate response to strong feelings\".The new law will apply to everyone in Wales, including visitors, and £. million is being invested in parenting support services.Advice and support for parents and s is available on the Welsh Government’s Give It Time website https:gov.wales parenting-give-it-time.Children’s charities like Barnardo’s Cymru and the NSPCC have supported the law change, but the ban has not been welcomed universally.As well as some opposition in the Senedd, mainly from the Welsh Conservatives, a campaign group called Be Reasonable argued the move would “inevitably catch ordinary, loving parents and turn them into criminals”, and their petition against the government’s proposals collected nearly , signatures in Wales.And the Welsh Government’s own studies suggest members of the public are equally ided over the issue.Researchers carried out three surveys between  and  to gauge public opinion on banning the physical punishment of children..removeWhile support for a smacking ban grew in , research shows that level fell slightly a year later. If anything, people’s opinions have become less rigid, with more people in  than in previous years saying they would need more information before deciding whether they agreed with the law change.Among those members of the public who said they supported a smacking ban in the last survey, more than one-thirdsaid they did not agree generally with the physical punishment of children.Other common reasons for supporting the ban included the belief there were other good forms of ensuring good behaviour and discipline , and the belief smacking was abuse, or could lead to abuse .Meanwhile, one in four peoplewho said they opposed the smacking ban in the most recent survey did so because they believed physical punishment was needed to control behaviour, the discipline a child, to teach respect or to show boundaries.Other common reasons for opposing the law change included the belief smacking doesn’t do any harm– including cases when people said it hadn’t done themselves or their own children any harm – and that smacking was OKit was a reasonable punishment and doesn’t go too far.Not everyone who smacks a child from March  will be automatically prosecuted. Wales four police forces have been encouraged to consider a \"rehabilitative alternative to prosecution\"this is more appropriate.\"In cases where the police decide it is appropriate to offer an out of court disposal, there will be an option of tailored parenting support to encourage positive parenting techniques and help avoid re-offending,\" the government has advised.Those parenting support schemes will be offered by councils. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBute Cottage Nursery is set to merge with Evenlode Primary under Vale of Glamorgan council plans opposed by hundreds.The council’s cabinet was urged to rethink the merger, with some councillors claiming not enough attention was given to a public consultation where most people opposed the plan.Cllr George Carroll, leader of the Conservative group on the Vale council, called in the merger decision to be looked at by the learning and culture scrutiny committee.He said: “That’s a clear and signicant majority of consultees who were opposed to this proposal. Insufficient consideration was made regarding those consultations responses.”The scrutiny committee, which met on Thursday, February , also heard from parents, governors and trade union representatives about their concerns over the merger.Richard Disley, chair of governors at Bute Cottage, said: “It’s been dficult to get our voices heard during this process. Our concerns have always been about the wellbeing of our staff. If the amalgamation happens, the current positions of the majority of nursery staff are only guaranteed for  months.“Long-serving permanent staff members who are in our current budget have job stability, will now only have guaranteed work for  months. Staff haven’t been offered any support from the local authority during this very stressful time.“Bute Cottage should be held up as an example of how things should be done, not merged into a primary school with the sole purpose of fitting into a – year model, for which there is no proof of improved outcomes for children. We have asked for evidence on a number of occasions but none has been forthcoming.”Kate Rees, a parent whose children went to Bute Cottage, said: “It was disappointing that there wasn’t more consideration for the issues we raised. Bute Cottage has its own headteacher, budget, governing body, and specialist staff. Those are the magic ingredients that come together to create the exceptional setting for education..remove“I have three children. All three of them were lucky enough to go to Bute Cottage, and they all attend Evenlode now, and Bute Cottage was just a really wonderful experience for them. I got to know that nursery really well. Because of that I’m absolutely passionate about the provision there.”Concerns over the merger include the possible relocation of the nursery to the Evenlode Primary School site, although this would be several years away and only a potential move and a change in the teaching style. The Vale council has said the merger would help provide continuity and stability for pupils to attend the same school from three to eleven years.Cllr Rhiannon Birch said the concerns were overblown and “disappointing”, and added high teaching standards would be kept after the merger.She said: “They will have the same staff, there will be the same guiding ethos, there will be the same standards of professionalism. To hear some of these speakers, you would think these children are going to be put in a field to poke each other with sticks, rather than having an education.“It’s very disappointing their lack of trust in teaching professionals who will continue to maintain high standards, to provide pastoral care, education and all the dferent aspects of nursery education. It seems to me incredible to believe that all of this should be going out of the window simply because we’re talking about the governing body.”Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said no changes to staff will be made as part of the merger, which would be restricted to how the school and nursery are governed.She said: “A consultation is not a referendum. It’s where we listen to views to see whether there’s any reason why the agreed policy … should not be applied. The nurseries would only be merged at a governance and leadership level, and there would be no change to where they’re operating. Those nurseries are not moving.“There will be no change to staffing or surroundings. There’s no reason to think that anything in terms of teaching and standards of learning in these schools will be altered in any way at all.”Asked about a potential future feasibility study into relocating the nursery next to Evenlode, she said: “Because you would want to see whether you have the best model, and whether it would be betterit were on one site. I’m on record as saying I don’t think it would be feasible.“But there were comments of people who don’t have cars, who live in the Evenlode catchment area, and actually walk from lower Penarth up to the nursery every day and back.“So you have to do a feasibility [study], to see whether or not that would work. But there is such a workload on the st Century Schools team, that unless it was prioritised, it would be a number of years before we could even look at it with the amount of other work.”If approved, the merger of the nursery and the primary school would take effect in September this year. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdfcddbbcaca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddaabeaaabaeddbede   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?164484979600","title":"covid  mon th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.
