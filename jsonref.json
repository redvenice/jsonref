Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Nobody trusts nobody no more,” says a long-haired young man, building a wall (or perhaps a tomb). “Everybody’s like, ‘Don’t come near me bro, you might have the infection.’” But this isn’t lockdown Britain – nor indeed lockdown anywhere in 2020. It’s the Derbyshire village of Eyam during the 1665-6 plague outbreak, as imagined by artist Nick Burton in the exquisitely doomy new comic strip Our Plague Year.Burton has a flair for the bittersweet. The two-page comic Lily that he showed in the Manchester Open Exhibition at Home last year was a romance between a bicycle and the woman who first rode it. Recalling Lily, Bren O’Callaghan, the curator of Home, contacted Burton in March asking if he might consider producing a comic “addressing some of the themes that were prevalent in our society at the moment”.Home will release new episodes from Our Plague Year on its website every Friday from 29 May (the impatient can subscribe to an email that will reach them two days earlier.) “Each is a vignette that dips into a small moment,” says Burton, who has built up enough plot and material for Our Plague Year to stretch to 100 episodes. A book seems likely. God help us all if the serialisation is extended and we reach that many episodes while still under lockdown.Researching similar events throughout history, Burton came across the story of Eyam, a village in the Peak District that famously isolated itself from surrounding communities after the Black Death arrived in a cloth delivery from London. “You could immediately see the connection with what was going on in our society,” says Burton, who notes the irony that, although he’s just constructed a dramatic universe around Eyam, circumstances dictate that he’s never set foot in the actual village.It’s no bad thing that the setting of Our Plague Year exists only in Burton’s imagination as “an alternative-world Eyam”. It frees him to redraw phenomena of our present time as historical fiction: a population struggling with confusing guidelines from on high nosy neighbours avidly policing local behaviour kamikaze amblers using bodily proximity as a threat.Drawn as lockdown continues and moods shift, Our Plague Year can marry the long narrative arcs of a graphic novel with the responsiveness of a strip cartoon like Peanuts or Doonesbury, which are more “read one day and in the bin the next”, notes Burton.The parallels with plague-beset Eyam are darkly, comically real. “Just like today, we’d have some people who adhere to the lockdown and others that think it’s ridiculous,” says Burton. He describes how the wealthier residents of Eyam swiftly departed for other residences, and how the boundaries of the village were policed.Contemporary conspiracy theorists may be wigging out over 5G towers and secret labs in Wuhan the residents of Eyam looked to the superstitions of their own time for the source of their suffering. “It was the end of the age of magic and the beginning of the age of science,” says Burton. “So you still had people blaming the fairies for it: they were such capricious, evil creatures in those days, people were scared of them.”The most touching evocation of Eyam has happened on Burton’s own doorstep. William Mompesson, the vicar of Eyam, closed the church and instead led his congregation to worship in the open, by a rock called Cucklet Delf. With the synagogue shut in Burton’s Salford neighbourhood, the local rabbi has become equally inventive. “I live in a three-storey flat here, and my kitchen window looks into an open space bounded on all sides by townhouses and flats,” he says. This space, usually populated by kids and trampolines, has become an ad hoc synagogue, a Cucklet Delf for our times: “The rabbi in the middle, and everybody in their windows reading from the scriptures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8864cba6106260ce9e616a161f598911d3f22e2b/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=52ca97ef366dd09f1fa55f2fa94050ae","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from people about the return to schools, whether to teach or take their children, from MondayPrimary schools will begin their phased reopening to all pupils on Monday after more than two months of general closures, prime minister Boris Johnson has announced.Schools are already open to vulnerable and key worker children, who will gradually be joined by their classmates – though many primary schools will not be open to all eligible pupils right away.We would like to hear from teachers and parents of children who are returning to school next week.How is your school preparing for children to return?

I have been out, and I’m not sure I like it. The new world has lots of rules and they’re largely opaque. And the dining out options are lousy. I began with a trip to a newly reopened fish and chip shop in Chingford, while resembling an extra from prison camp drama Tenko, hair-styling, mascara and bra-wearing having fallen off my agenda several months ago. Nowadays, only Rita Ora and women on TikTok wear actual makeup. The rest of us have grown too accustomed to not caring. Pre-lockdown, I wore more makeup than your average rodeo clown right now, bothering even to tweezer a ision in my monobrow feels fancy.No one will see me in the chip shop, anyway. The rules –\u0026nbspbecause there are chip shop rules these days – say queuing in a confined space is forbidden. “Two people only permitted inside the shop,” the sign said. Everyone found this confusing. Did that mean two people from one household? Or two strangers? Did it mean that, if two people were inside the shop, I could stand outside and shout my order? Everyone’s confusion about the new rules made the woman serving us livid. Although I’m not sure if she was mad about us breaking the rules or mad that the rules meant she had to wear a mask.Alas, those chips, which I’d dreamed about and plotted over for more than 60 days, were lukewarm and soggy by the time I’d driven them home. The rules strictly forbid leaning against the ledge eating them hot and fresh in the chip shop while helping yourself to extra salt and vinegar, which, now that I think about it, was one of life’s sweetest, simplest pleasures. Yes, eating in a layby is, technically, permitted, but let’s face it, I’d look like a carb-loading dogger. I’m trying hard to love life in the new world, but my feelings are presently tepid.Along with chip shops and takeaway coffee, we seem to have been given back the right to have picnics. This is great news for fans of eating Sainsbury’s coleslaw somewhere that has no working toilet, throwing a scotch egg into a bush to re-route hornets, drinking too much warm rosé with friends of friends you have never really liked, and inevitably stinging your va-jay-jay on nettles while weeing. It’s a no from me, but many people are devotees. The rule seems to be that you can eat mini-quiches outdoors, but mind who you do it with. And do not, whatever you do, attempt to use a picnic bench in the park for your picnic, because they’re all still taped up like crime scenes.It could be time for us to question many of these things, and what we possibly need right now are more rule-breakers. The most useful thing Dominic Cummings could do for his country right now is to flout lockdown again, only this time do it in a pub beer garden. He needs to take one for the team. There are few sadder sights across the land than these much-loved but now abandoned sun traps, their tatty wooden benches baking indolently in the sun. All these unseasonably glorious May days have been going to waste, and for a man so fiercely Brexit, that is about as anti-British as it gets. I drove past a dozen pubs on my way home with my lukewarm chips, and my heart was colder still.Cummings’ last jaunt made us question our pilfered right to wander in forests and even take a pleasant day trip to Barnard Castle, but we need him for a much bigger job. He should start this Saturday morning with a swift drink on the lovely sun terrace outside the The Albion in Islington, before sinking four or so more – possibly with his top off – over lunchtime.Yes, the fallout would be incendiary, but once the quacking had stopped, something magical might happen. Perhaps we could prise these spaces open again. Although we’re grateful for car showrooms and golf clubs, these things mean nothing to the majority.\u0026nbspAnd, obviously, there would need to be some rules – most of us have proved we’re good at following those – but there would also be cloudy cider with friends, giant Jenga, hot chips in a plastic basket, cheap ketchup in sachets, bad jokes and lots of sunburned forearms. Things will move on, but I know I will never take my right to loiter and languish, to laugh with friends or to drink lager from a pint glass for granted ever again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa4acadb33d7c7608cd6cfbfa5200732b0ac76f/0_110_4350_2610/master/4350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=074ab4160a88803971a56b9db5d84c25","title":"it makes everything taste better how to buy and cook with fish sauce","story":"Ask anyone who grew up with fish sauce and they’ll tell you anything from ragu to beans on toast can benefit from a splash or twoYes, on its own, the olfactory experience of fish sauce might remind you of standing in the middle of pungent, damp fish market, knee deep in fishy detritus. But when it is part of much greater whole, fish sauce has a magic power: it lifts the rest of a dish.\u0026nbspFor a Thai diner, great service is not being fussed and fawned over. It is not being taken through the menu details blow by blow – it comes in the form of a little dish filled with freshly chopped birds eye chillies, immersed in fish sauce, which arrives at your table before your food is served. That action alone has the power to make the diner return. This is no joke. A condiment made of variants of fish, fish parts, salt (and sometimes water) is an important ingredient for a majority of world cuisines, whether they’re calling it nahm pla, shottsuru, nuoc mam, garum, patis, ayu gyosho, colatura di alici, teuk trei, kecap, Worcestershire, or terasi.The names may vary, but what is universally agreed upon is that, if you’ve got a deft hand, fish sauce makes a good dish infinitely better, and instantly gives something ho-hum an X-factor.\u0026nbspIf the cook is the conductor of a dish, then fish sauce is the first violin, defining and carrying the melody, adding character. But its inclusion is often unknowable. Unless you are a well-versed home cook or chef, the thing that makes a dish taste amazing can’t quite be placed.If your heritage means you grew up eating food where fish sauce is a ubiquitous ingredient, you probably have the proclivity to souse nearly everything savoury with it.\u0026nbspI grew up thinking fried eggs came complete with fish sauce, the lacy fried whites and creamy half-cooked yolks were the perfect vehicle for the deep, rich, salty mineral taste I craved. That was where the flavour and satiety was.I was shamed into submission by a visiting school friend who pinched her nose on a play date when she saw me eat said eggs with relish. Afterwards I asked my mum to please cook something “normal” when friends were over like canned beans on toast.Experiences like this mean that, in the past, many of us added fish sauce to our cooking timidly – in the presence of our friends of paler shades – for fear they’d unfriend us if they knew what we were actually eating. So perhaps it is on us that it’s been kept secret for so long.\u0026nbspFast forward 30 years and much to my chagrin it’s suddenly very hip for white ladies and gentlemen to write fish sauce into their recipes, well dang that!\u0026nbspNo, I’m not bitter, I’m mainly glad that it’s out in the world more broadly, and has become a pantry staple. Now we’ve arrived at the state of maturity where we can all eat more delicious food – without judgemental stares – we have power in numbers. We can demand better quality fish sauce.First, the basics: fish sauces can be same, same but different. Their tastes vary on factors like the species of fish used (most commonly oily fish varieties) whether it is fresh water or from the open sea how salt much is added whether or not fish is the only protein (there are versions that include krill, squid, prawns, soy and even wheat) what kind of vessel was used during the ageing process the method of extraction and so on. Speak to a connoisseur, and they will tell you that these are all crucial to differentiation between sauces. Most of us don’t look at the fine print – but it’s worth it.Some of my favourite South East Asian fish sauces are made in Phu Cuoc, Vietnam and the Traat region of Southern Thailand.\u0026nbspMegachef brown label premium fish sauce: This is a collaboration between Megachef and the venerable chef David Thompson. It has many fans including, but not limited to chefs Christine Mansfield, Prin Polsuk and Andy Ricker.Red Boat premium 40N: This is my go to. I love it so much that I started stocking it at our grocery store, so that I can have access to it without shortage. It has a lovely clean flavour, and is light enough to simply dress greens without overpowering the delicateness of freshly picked leaves. Chef’s Thi Le and Jerry Mai also are fans of Red Boat. If you’re interested in the different types of by-products that can come from fish sauce production, I urge you to look them up. They’ve put out an interesting fish salt which chef Andy Ricker likes to use when grilling meat.\u0026nbspThere are codes of conduct that you must be aware of if this is your first foray – go in gently. If you are using fish sauce, start with a few drops, and keep tasting until you hit the right balance.\u0026nbspDon’t mix your salts, start as a puritan. If you are using fish sauce, often that will be enough, no need to go overboard and use soy sauce or salt in the same dish. When your hand is deft, that is when you can experiment.\u0026nbspWhen your next dinner guest comments on how wonderful your cooking is, you can whole-heartedly tell them “why, I just added fish sauce” and know you have been inducted into a tradition that goes back thousands of years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eb49630ef3f03e719349fcf3d8164641120c889/0_331_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a711dad3050a787aacf2b7f49a984e06","title":"transfer news paris saint germain psg inter agreement mauro icardi","story":"Paris Saint-Germain are set to land their first major signing of the summer after reaching an agreement with Internazionale for Mauro Icardi.The Argentinian striker has spent the season on loan at PSG and the clubs have struck a deal worth €50m (£45m), plus €7m in add-ons, to make the transfer permanent.The fee may be an indication of the effect that coronavirus will have on the summer transfer market. PSG had negotiated a clause to buy Icardi for €70m, but the ongoing financial uncertainty in European football means the price will be significantly lower.The Inter sporting director, Piero Ausilio, said earlier on Friday: “Icardi wants to stay at PSG and we are in talks to make that happen.”Icardi joined Inter in 2013 and was the joint top scorer in Serie A in 2015 with Luca Toni on 22 goals but he later fell out with the club’s hierarchy and fans and it was unlikely he would return to the club after joining PSG on loan last year.At PSG he has scored 12 goals in 20 Ligue 1 games and, significantly, five times in six Champions League matches.

He has made considerable progress, clinching the confirmations of two supreme court justices and seing a broad transformation of the justice system to conservatism.“This is an historic opportunity,” Graham told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday. “We’ve put over 200 federal judges on the bench … If you can get four more years, I mean, it would change the judiciary for several generations.“So if you’re a circuit judge in your mid-60s, late 60s, you can take senior status, now would be a good time to do that, if you want to make sure the judiciary is right of center.”Graham added: “So do it now … I need some time.”McConnell has made the confirmation of new judges a priority, even during the coronavirus pandemic.Experts agree it would be possible for judges to be confirmed during a lame duck period, meaning the time between Trump losing the presidency to Joe Biden and Democrats retaking the Senate, in November, and the resumption of business in January.In the supreme court, Trump has appointed Neil Gorsuch, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia, and Brett Kavanaugh, to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy.The court thereby has a 5-4 conservative majority, with the health of 87-year-old liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg watched keenly from both sides of the aisle.Hewitt asked Graham if he had any knowledge of a supreme court justice planning to retire this year. No, the senator said, but he added that if a vacancy does arise, filling it before the election “would be the goal”.McConnell famously refused to replace Scalia with Merrick Garland, Barack Obama’s nominee, a moderate, the Senate leader citing contested precedent when claiming vacancies should not be filled in an election year.McConnell has said no such strictures would apply in what could be Trump’s last year in office.“So if a vacancy did occur, and I don’t expect one to, I hope everybody has a long, healthy 2020 on the court … you would see an effort by Republicans, I’m sure, to fill the vacancy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f50d146515d8f8b50e819d672918938ace28795c/0_133_3991_2395/master/3991.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d445f8b840a71ff4af44d48a0e5ee006","title":"my partner has been seeing another woman for years","story":"He is psychologically abusive towards me but treats her much better.

Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

But it’s a sliding scale –\u0026nbspand one that certainly mattered less when she was knocking out undeniable dance-pop party starters like Poker Face and Just Dance, or cementing her status as pop’s freaky outlier on the twisted Bad Romance. That she appeared in alien-like form in that song’s video made perfect sense: here was a chameleonic pop superstar in the vein of Bowie, Prince and Madonna opening a portal to an escapist dimension. Later, it made sense that she would lean into the imagery of hair metal on 2011’s gloriously OTT, Springsteen-referencing Born This Way. Yet on 2013’s bloated Artpop – billed as an exploration of the “reverse Warholian” phenomenon in pop culture, whatever that may be, and featuring at least one performance in which she employed a “vomit artist” to puke green paint on her chest – the aesthetic felt more like desperate distraction tactics.Seemingly bruised by that album’s relative commercial failure (2.5m global sales compared with debut album The Fame’s 15m), she disowned dance-pop altogether on 2016’s Joanne. Ludicrous lobster hats and sinewy meat dresses were swapped for pink stetsons and denim cut-offs, while early producer RedOne’s churning synthpop was replaced by Mark Ronson’s rustic warmth. Collaborators included Florence Welch, Josh Homme and Father John Misty, while the album’s stripped-back sound pushed the rockist assumption that quieter somehow equals more authentic. Its middling success was quickly superseded by the Oscar-winning, chart-topping movie A Star Is Born, in which Gaga’s character Ally was locked in a plastic pop v heartfelt rock authenticity war.But, as ever, it’s all about packaging, and Joanne was as much of a pose as Artpop. In many ways, the ballad-free, dancefloor-primed Chromatica represents not only Gaga’s most personal record, but her most straightforward. Obviously there’s a conceptual framework – that title, despite sounding like a Mac software update, actually represents a planet anchored by equality and inhabited by “kindness punks” – but it feels much lighter than before. As Gaga said in a recent interview with Zane Lowe, she prioritised “simple messaging”, a phrase that would have been reverse-Warholed up its own backside a few years ago.Fun and dumb lead single Stupid Love aside, the majority of Chromatica’s 13 short and to the point songs (ignoring three orchestral interludes that feel beamed in from another album) dig into the person behind the facade. On dark centrepiece 911, she details her reliance on antipsychotic medication (“Keep my dolls inside diamond boxes  Save ’em ’til I know I’m gon’ drop this”) over a chugging swirl of industrial synths, while opener Alice dismisses Gaga’s damaging obsession with perfection over a sugary house confection. Babylon, meanwhile, buoyed by classic house piano and a soul-stirring choir, pulls off the very Gaga trick of conflating the big and the small, touching on the Bible, ancient mythology and, as she’s done ever since the start, the complexities of fame. The healing power of dance, cruelly frustrated by the current lockdown situation, rushes through the album like cheap poppers, with the 90s house pop of the Ariana Grande duet Rain on Me acknowledging trauma before dragging it on to a sticky provincial nightclub floor. The ludicrous Elton John collaboration Sine From Above – which, with its panpipe-inflected beat and unstoppable euphoric rush, would win Eurovision on any given year – digs deeper into this simple idea that music can soothe even the most damaged soul.That song ends with an unexpected shift into cranium-rattling drum’n’bass, a fleeting taste of experimentation that feels oddly missing elsewhere. While some of Gaga’s best work was made quickly, often on the road in tour buses, the songs on Chromatica were passed around from producer to producer apparently to free up the process. (Strangely, this is the first album not to feature Gaga as a listed producer, with the credits naming everyone from BloodPop to EDM producer Axwell to noise merchant Skrillex, while maximalist alt-pop producer Sophie – who confirmed her involvement back in 2018 – is noticeably absent.) At times, as on the generic Eurodance double-whammy of Free Woman and Fun Tonight, it means the songs feel overworked: sometimes their often short running times deny them space to breathe (the claustrophobic Plastic Doll). Sour Candy, a collaboration with K-pop girl band Blackpink, falls disappointingly flat: aiming for the sweaty throb of deep house,\u0026nbspit ends up sounding like a dashed off, cheaply produced interlude.\u0026nbspGaga is on much safer ground gliding around the joyous French house swirl of Replay, which has a startling lyric about burying trauma in graves and scratching at the dirt of her psyche. It’s another example of how, after years of using her music to try to heal other people – be it her gay fanbase on Born This Way, or her family on Joanne, an album named after her dead aunt – Chromatica finally turns that gaze inwards without ending the party. Unsurprisingly Gaga’s truest self was always going to be as loud as possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4abe85afc46f0f0cae0762e7b92f20ea06a5a13/0_306_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1009240f862ec30c02ee7883f4272a6f","title":"brexit is the uk headed for a no deal","story":"For the past few months UK and EU negotiators have been locked in talks trying to thrash out a trade deal before 1 January.

The numbers were either provided in response to the ’s request for figures, or in statements MPs had released to constituents.Johnson has repeatedly suggested it was time to “move on” from the Cummings row, despite about half of Tory backbenchers – more than 100 MPs – calling for his most senior aide to resign or be sacked, or criticising Cummings. Many said they were motivated by their constituents’ anger.“I do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance,” she said.Several Conservative MPs in marginal seats said they had received more than 1,000 emails about Cummings, in some cases dwarfing their majority. While the average number of emails each MP got was 271, the Tory MPs analysed by the  received 590 each on average.Many MPs said the emails were from people writing to them for the first time and not the common copy-and-paste messages on a campaigning issue, and for some it has been the most significant volume since the Brexit crisis in parliament.“Not one has been computer-generated, they are all inidual observations. This is not about Brexit, or a Labour party campaign, none of this is orchestrated.”Richard Fuller, Tory MP for North East Bedfordshire, wrote to constituents: “I have been struck by just how many emails I have received from constituents about the actions taken by Mr Cummings and the strength of sentiment.“Most emails contained strong criticisms.\u0026nbspThe words used by constituents to express their feeling – ‘disgust’, ‘incensed’, ‘disgraceful’, ‘shameful’, ‘anger’ – convey clearly how deeply hurtful this revelation has been for them.“Many constituents included personal stories of sacrifice and loss a number sharing the searing pain of bereavement in this extraordinary period of isolation and confinement.\u0026nbspI have read fully each of the emails sent to me.”He added: “The explanation of this human dilemma has not been communicated in such a manner as to heal the hurt that has been felt.\u0026nbspAn apology is not always needed as a concession that you did something wrong but sometimes to show that you understand the pain to others that may have been caused.”Diana Johnson, Labour MP for Hull North since 2005, said: “Other than Brexit, this is the biggest postbag I’ve had for many years. And it’s still coming in.”Polling suggests most people were unconvinced by Cummings’ explanation of his movements, delivered in a hastily arranged press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday.Among the Conservatives receiving more than 1,000 emails about Cummings were Alex Chalk, MP for Cheltenham, who has a majority of 981 Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon, whose majority is 628 and Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and and Kincardine, with a majority of 843.Not all of the correspondence was negative, although many MPs said their mailbox was overwhelmingly weighted towards criticism of the adviser.Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and Oxford University fellow teaching politics, said the crisis had touched a nerve akin to the MPs’ expenses revelations. “The real worry for government is when something that they do politicises people who normally wouldn’t ever write to their MP about something like this, who never really engage in politics,” he said.He added: “I think what’s happened is our daily lives are dominated by what’s coming out of No 10.\u0026nbspSo we’re hanging on the words of the prime minister and his top team in a way that you normally would never ever get, and that does bring politics into your life much more vividly. So people then inspect the credentials of the people doing that in a much greater way.“The thing that makes this so poisonous for Boris Johnson and the top team is that we’re in this incredibly unusual crisis moment where everything the government does relies on our trust, because everything they do is essentially asking us to change our behaviour. And that requires faith in the integrity and the authority of the government.”One Tory MP said they had received 400 emails, mostly against Cummings. In the Tory stronghold of the south-west, Selaine Saxby, MP for North Devon, was hit with 800 messages and Cherilyn Mackrory, of Truro and Falmouth, said she had received nearly 1,000.Elliot Colburn, 27, the Conservative MP representing the marginal Carshalton and Wallington seat, wrote to Johnson to say he had received more emails on this issue than any other. He said “many hundreds of messages from concerned constituents” had called on Cummings to resign.At the other end of the UK, the leader of the Scottish National party in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he had received more than 1,000 emails. “At the peak I was getting one email a minute. It’s easily more than 1,000,” he said.Labour’s Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, said she had had 117 emails, with “so many powerful stories of sacrifice”. One of her constituents wrote to say how her mother had died alone of Covid-19 in a London hospital on 8 April and “every instinct” in her body had told to go to be with her for her final moments, but she had abided by the government’s rules.The Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, Neil Coyle, said he had received 227 emails, only one in support of Cummings. He said: “They are all unique and many are very sad as they explain their anger based on what they’ve been through – including missing relatives at the end of life.”Chris Bryant, Labour MP for the Rhondda, said he had received 20 messages a day and has had a constituent tell him he now has no intention of abiding by the lockdown rules since Cummings’ drive to Durham and later to Barnard Castle.

It was hoped a meeting of key stakeholders on Thursday would provide more clarity but a date for returning to training is now not expected until next week. Different clubs have varying views on how many weeks of training will be required before matches can begin with a number believing four will be sufficient. The study published on Friday is likely to lead to a further delay, however.“A period of around six weeks of preparation is likely to be sufficient for most athletes to return to being competition ready,” reads the study. “Although this will ultimately depend on the length of governmental social distancing policies, which differ by country.”Premiership Rugby still hopes to complete its entire season – nine remaining rounds as well as the play-offs – but increasingly that is looking unlikely. Indeed, the Northampton chairman, John White, admitted that it may end up being the case that only play-offs take place, based on current league positions. He said: “As time rolls on, we may not get nine rounds in – it may go down to just play-offs eventually. But there is a determination to see the season out, so I think we will do that.”The fact that Kemp co-authored the new study is significant because he is responsible for drawing up a list of stringent protocols that clubs must adhere to before returning to training. The present hold-up is in the main because of concerns over testing but the study raises additional issues of the dangers of players suffering injuries after a lengthy lay-off. Drawing on comparisons with the NFL, which was shut down for 20 weeks in 2011 and saw a significant increase in achilles injuries upon returning, the study also warns that the length of the lockdown could lead to more injuries next season.“A key concern arising from a period of enforced modified training due to Covid-19 is that athletes cannot maintain physical qualities that likely protect against injury,” continues the study. “A 20-week shutdown of the National Football League in 2011 was associated with a four-fold increase in achilles tendon ruptures in the first 29 days of a condensed return to competition period. Over the subsequent season, soft tissue injuries were higher than preceding or subsequent seasons.\u0026nbsp“In professional rugby union, even after a short off-season typically lasting four-to-five weeks during which athletes have opportunities to train, there is a greater frequency and burden of training injuries in the early, compared with later, period of pre-season. This highlights one of the challenges when athletes return following an extended period of enforced modified training.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/496deaf80b12060bbeb7ff7008c85ecb8e05dc38/40_34_3457_2074/master/3457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71246ff9861b8138145253366f4f7221","title":"guardian to stream unicorn theatre anansi saturday family shows","story":"Trio of stories about Anansi, the spider from West African and Caribbean folklore, will be available free and with accompanying activities has partnered with the Unicorn theatre to present a free digital theatre series inspired by its acclaimed 2019 production Anansi the Spider.Three tales about the mischievous folkloric webspinner, designed for audiences aged three to eight, will be streamed on Saturday mornings on the  website and the Unicorn’s YouTube channel in May and June. The episodes, which will then be available on demand for three weeks, reunite the original cast of the production, Afia Abusham, Juliet Okotie and Sapphire Joy, who filmed themselves performing in their homes.The theatre’s artistic director, Justin Audibert, who staged the original production, said the Unicorn’s first entirely digitally created theatre experience was designed to be a “treat” for young audiences confined by the lockdown. Audibert said that the Covid-19 restrictions had denied children “the sense of special occasion” you get from a trip to the theatre: “It’s strange for young people to suddenly not have that at all.” He said it is important for them to come together “with other young people at the same time”, as they will for the 11am launches of the streams. “There is nothing like seeing young people lining up outside to see one of your shows,” said Audibert, who hopes that Anansi the Spider Re-Spun will “create a sense of an event in your own home”.The Unicorn keeps archive recordings of its past shows but Audibert said that a film shot with a static camera would not “capture the essence of what we made with the show”. Instead the creative team have embraced the limits of lockdown and explored how the three performers can tell a story virtually, collaborating with the independent production company Illuminations. Although filmed separately, the actors will sometimes be seen together in split-screen.The three films come with a range of creative resources for parents and teachers, as well as activities including a singing workshop. Further digital productions, including for older children, are also planned.Audibert said the many tales that have been told featuring Anansi, the trickster spider from west African and Caribbean folklore, have a “wicked fun” about them. Their morals are tangled inside the scheming hero’s spirited adventures. The director grew up hearing the stories and said “the thing I love about the character is that he always ends up going one step too far.

In a video of the subsequent arrest, taken by one of the many members of the public that witnessed the violent event, Floyd, who was black, can be seen on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him while a white officer, Derek Chauvin, presses him to the pavement with his knee on Floyd’s neck.Chauvin can be seen holding Floyd down for minutes as Floyd complains he can’t breathe, speaking with greater difficulty and then becoming unresponsive, as witnesses beg the officers to release him. The video ends with paramedics lifting a limp Floyd on to a stretcher and placing him in an ambulance.Floyd, 46, grew up in Houston’s Third Ward, one of the city’s predominantly black neighborhoods, where he and Harris met in middle school. At 6ft6in, Floyd emerged as a star football player, positioned as the tight end for Jack Yates’ high school team, and played in the 1992 state championship game in the Houston Astrodome.Donnell Cooper, one of Floyd’s former classmates, said he remembered watching Floyd score touchdowns. Floyd towered over everyone and earned the nickname “gentle giant”.“Quiet personality but a beautiful spirit,” Cooper said.His life later took a different turn and in 2007 Floyd was charged with armed robbery in a home invasion in Houston and in 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison as part of a plea deal, according to court documents.Harris, Floyd’s childhood friend, said he and some of their mutual friends had moved to Minneapolis in search of jobs around 2014. Harris said he talked Floyd into moving there as well after he got out of prison.Floyd landed a job working security at a Salvation Army store in downtown Minneapolis. He later started working two jobs, one driving trucks and another as a bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as “Big Floyd”.“Always cheerful,” Jovanni Tunstrom, the bistro’s owner, said. “He had a good attitude. He would dance badly to make people laugh. I tried to teach him how to dance because he loved Latin music, but I couldn’t because he was too tall for me. He always called me ‘Bossman’. I said, ‘Floyd, don’t call me Bossman. I’m your friend.’”Harris said Floyd was laid off when Minnesota shut down restaurants as part of a stay-at-home order to curb the Covid-19 pandemic. He said he spoke with Floyd on Sunday night and gave him some information for contacting a temporary jobs agency.“He was doing whatever it takes to maintain going forward with his life,” Harris said, adding he couldn’t believe that Floyd would resort to forgery. “I’ve never known him to do anything like that.”“The way he died was senseless,” Harris said. “He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn’t designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can’t get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands.”Floyd leaves behind a six-year-old daughter who still lives in Houston with her mother, Roxie Washington,\u0026nbspthe Houston Chronicle reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7aea04b53767856278eddb23fd453bc3a683f4/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=10119833672de56e499fe6f9751e8c8e","title":"coronavirus symptoms not isolating sage track and trace","story":"Scientists say failure to follow advice raises questions over test-and-trace policyOnly half of people who develop coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for at least a week, according to government science advisers, raising urgent questions about the test-and-trace strategy aimed to contain future outbreaks.The new system, which launched this week, requires people to self-isolate for 14 days if they are told by tracers that they recently came into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus.The revelations appear in the latest tranche of documents and the first minutes of meetings published by Sage. The minutes from 34 meetings held from January to May were released with other documents submitted to Sage by its modelling and behavioural science subgroups.The minutes reveal a sense of rising anxiety at Sage as scientists saw the number of cases grow faster than expected, with the experts recommending on 13 March that household isolation and protecting older, more vulnerable people should happen “soon”.Three days later, the advice changed: the committee heard there could be 10,000 new cases a day, prompting them to recommend further physical distancing “as soon as possible” adding that a “significant increase in testing” was needed.The group of experts considered further documents on the track-and-trace system, with one report from behavioural scientists warning that they “anticipate major behavioural barriers” to people using the NHS contact-tracing app, that would prevent it from being the primary method of containing outbreaks.They go on to warn that foreign powers will seek to capitalise on any weaknesses they spot in the UK’s response to the outbreak.Many of the documents include redactions, mostly of names of people on the Sage secretariat and others who participated directly in the meetings.A further meeting on 18 March said that evidence supported school closures on a national level “as soon as practicable to prevent NHS intensive care capacity being exceeded”, warning that the UK appeared to be a few weeks behind Italy in the pandemic curve. The advice added: “If the interventions are required, it would be better to act early.” Boris Johnson announced immediate schools closures in England that day.The chronology of the minutes shows how rapidly events overtook planning. On 3 March, a Sage meeting said there was “currently no evidence that cancelling large events would be effective”, and that closing restaurants and bars “would have an effect, but would be very difficult to implement”. But only a week later, the next Sage meeting said the UK could have up to 10,000 cases, spread nationally.Other points raised by the documents include:This would need about 30 contacts to be tested per case, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which reports to the health department, said in meetings in April, adding: “Beyond that, benefits would be marginal.”The documents are the latest to be released after No 10 came under pressure to publish the membership of Sage and the advice it provided to ministers. In April, the  revealed that Cummings, the prime minister’s senior aide, had participated in Sage meetings. His presence at meetings “shocked” the government’s former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who said: “If you are giving science advice, your advice should be free of any political bias.”The minutes show that Dominic Cummings attended six of the 34 meetings, mainly ones in later April and May, as a government representative.

But if R reaches one, and allowing more social mobility could easily allow it to rise, the number of people becoming infected each day remains the same.It was for ministers to decide what to do, he said. That impact on health had to be set against the wider impact of the lockdown on society and the economy. “That’s clearly a political decision. It’s not a scientific decision,” he said.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the\u0026nbspUniversity of Edinburgh and also a member of the Sage modelling group, Spi-M, said there was very little chance of eradicating the virus. “That was the World Health Organization’s strategy in the early stages of this pandemic. That’s a strategy they only formally abandoned a few weeks ago. And given that yesterday saw the highest number of cases reported globally ever, global eradication doesn’t look like happening any time soon,” he said.The relationship with Covid-19 we have had for five months “might turn out to be a lifelong relationship”, he said. It is not possible to maintain physical distancing for ever and there is no vaccine yet. “A second wave really is a clear and present danger,” he said.He was not making predictions, he said, but intensive surveillance, large-scale screening, effective contact tracing, isolation of cases, quarantine for international arrivals and some residual physical distancing “is a possible new normal”, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6859643604e4c21d4e3c2ca26e2a4ad29916869b/0_249_4142_2486/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef44d728affa5b9122e5a499f4c8d13c","title":"covid 19 surgisphere hydroxychloroquine study lancet coronavirus who questioned by researchers medical professionals","story":"Surgisphere issues public statement defending integrity of coronavirus study published in the LancetMore than 120 researchers and medical professionals from around the world have written an open letter to the editor of the Lancet raising serious concerns about a large and widely publicised global study that prompted the World Health Organisation to halt several Covid-19 clinical trials.On Thursday  Australia revealed that the Australian data in the study, published last week,\u0026nbspdid not reconcile with health department records or databases.The study found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug.Questions about\u0026nbspthe paper’s statistical modelling\u0026nbspwere also raised by Columbia University in the US, prompting Surgisphere, the company that manages the database of patients used to inform the study, to\u0026nbspissue a public statement defending the integrity of the study.But now further questions have been raised about the Surgisphere database and the study methodology. The signatories to the open letter, directed to the Lancet and the study authors, include prominent sceptics of the value of using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19. The letter lists 10 major concerns about the statistical analysis and data integrity of the study.“The authors have not adhered to standard practices in the machine learning and statistics community,” the letter states. “They have not released their code or data.”The Lancet is among the many signatories to a statement on data sharing for Covid-19 studies.“There was no ethics review,” the letter continues. “There was no mention of the countries or hospitals that contributed to the data source and no acknowledgments to their contributions. A request to the authors for information on the contributing centres was denied. Data from Australia are not compatible with government reports. Surgisphere have since stated this was an error of classification of one hospital from Asia. This indicates the need for further error checking throughout the database.”The letter also expressed concern about unusually small reported variances in baseline variables, interventions and outcomes between continents, despite significant differences in demographics.There is currently no strong, replicated evidence that any drug is effective for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19. This includes hydroxychloroquine, which has long been used for malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its safety and harm profile for treating those illnesses is understood. It is not well understood for Covid-19.Governments around the world have warned against using hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing the virus, highlighting the drug’s potentially toxic side effects and potential to cause heart abnormalities. There have been serious reports of harm due to people self-medicating\u0026nbspwith hydroxychloroquine\u0026nbspand related drugs during the pandemic.\u0026nbspResearchers are not calling for clinical trials to be halted in the light of the Lancet study. There is a consensus that more strong studies are needed exploring treatments including antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials. Australia has contacted the Lancet, Surgisphere and the authors of the study for a response to the concerns outlined in the letter.Surgisphere founder Dr Sapan Desai, also an author on the Lancet paper,\u0026nbspsaid before the release of the letter he appreciated the “enthusiasm and lively discussion with respect to our important multi-national observational registry study published in\u0026nbspthe Lancet medical journal”.“We appreciate the highly complimentary responses that we have received and the requests for data-driven partnerships as well as clarifications,” he said.“The analyses were carefully performed, and the interpretations provided were intentionally measured. We studied a very specific group of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 and have clearly stated that the results of our analyses should not be over-interpreted to those that have yet to develop such disease or those that have not been hospitalised. We also clearly outlined the limitations of an observational study that cannot fully control for unobservable confounding measures and concluded that off label use of the drug regimens outside of the context of a clinical trial should not be recommended.”Do you know more? melissa.davey@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba4e518b5da5ad1816cf6697ffc8ebebe138650/0_100_3305_1982/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5fb4b57fdd791c83db792420f42e39c","title":"demand is huge eu citizens flock to open air cinemas as lockdown eases","story":"From Berlin to Madrid the movies are back, albeit with hygiene and distancing restrictionsAs Madrid’s spring evenings warm into summer nights, cinema-goers are parking up to watch Grease. In Munich, they are taking al fresco seats to follow the adventures of a communist kangaroo with a penchant for boozy chocolates, and in Prague they are witnessing a croaky vigilante work out some profound childhood traumas.As Europe begins to stir from its Covid-19 lockdown, people bloated by two-month boxset binges have a new way to feed their entertainment needs as they emerge, blinking, into the daylight. Or, rather, the twilight.Open-air cinemas in Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic and Greece have re-opened in recent days, albeit at reduced capacity and with the novel strictures of physical distancing.The Autocine Madrid Race drive-in welcomed 200 customers back on Wednesday night with a screening of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John’s appropriately escapist and nostalgic paean to 1950s high school life.In normal times, the outdoor cinema screens films for 1,500 people at a time, but its co-founder, Cristina Porta, isn’t complaining. “It’s been very, very good this week and we’ve have a very warm welcome back,” she said.“Our customers were mad keen to get back and the demand has been huge. Drive-in cinemas are kind of made for life in the time of this virus.”As the Spanish capital emerges further out of lockdown, the drive-in’s capacity will grow to 475 and then 850 people. Among the films slated for the coming weeks are Ghostbusters, the Goonies, Mamma Mia and Pulp Fiction.“People are thrilled and are saying they want to spend the whole summer here,” said Porta. “If you’re in Madrid, it’s a bit like going to the beach.”Open-air cinemas will begin reopening across Germany on Friday evening, and indoor cinemas are expected to get the go-ahead from July.Operators say they welcome the chance to be among the first cultural institutions to be able to inject joy back into people’s lives.They also recognise the responsibility they have. If successful, their navigation of hygiene and distancing regulations will serve as a blueprint for other cultural venues such as concert halls and performance venues.“We do this with both a laughing and a crying eye,” said Christian Bräuer, the manager of the Yorck Kino cinema chain in Germany. “What we’re doing doesn’t make sense financially … but it’s important that cinema comes back into our lives.”Revenue will be slashed because of the reduction in seating to ensure spectators maintain the required 1.5 metre distance. Cinemas such as the Friedrichshain Freiluftkino in north-east Berlin, which usually has room for 1,700 people, has been reduced to just 500 seats.Cushions taped onto benches determine where people can sit, and with every other row kept empty, cinema goers will be able to enter and exit without coming close to others and are advised to buy tickets online to avoid queues.Disinfectant sprays will be on hand and the wearing of face masks, obligatory in many other public places, will not be necessary once people are seated. They will to be worn, however, if people go to the toilet.Munich’s Kino am Olympiasee\u0026nbspis believed to be the first open-air cinema to reopen anywhere in Germany. It will spool up the projector on Friday night, showing The Kangaroo Chronicles, a film about a man who – spoiler alert – opens his door one day to find a kangaroo standing there.Rather than the usual 2,000 places, there will for now be 500 – either deckchairs or love seats - and tickets are only available online. Out of solidarity to indoor cinemas that remain closed, €1 from each ticket will be donated to a fund to support their survival.One of Prague’s most evocative sites, the ghostly half-abandoned Strahov stadium perched on a hill above the Czech capital’s tourist attractions, has become the centrepiece for the revival of drive-in cinemas in the city.It has fallen into disrepair since the 1989 velvet revolution triggered the downfall of the communist regime in what was then Czechoslovakia and has since served as a football training ground and occasional concert venue.While the Czech Republic’s indoor cinemas were still closed it staged the 2008 Batman film, The Dark Knight, on 12 May after Prague city council, the venue’s owner, gave permission for a parking area to be turned into a makeshift movie theatre with capacity for 120 cars. The admission price is 350 koruna (£11.70) per car.Starting at 9pm every night, films are projected onto to shipping containers covered in white sheets.“The whole place has a post-apocalyptic vibe. It is definitely a unique experience,” said Jakub Dostál, the project organiser. “We wanted to find a way of getting people to start socialising again.”Indoor cinemashave also reopened with the obligatory distancing requirements, but Dostal said response from cinema-goers had been overwhelmingly positive.Demand, however, has fallen from the first week, when every night was a sellout, to an average of 70 cars a night. Dostal attributed the decline to a shortage in newly-distributed films caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.It is one of several drive-in cinemas to open in the city recent weeks. Among other venues are a theatre near Prague’s Vaclav Havel airport and another at a freight railway station in Žižkov.One positive spin-off of the Strahov project has been a reported drop in crime in an area reputed for night-time drug dealing. Bruce Wayne would doubtless approve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ba71b5578509f78e95ff044b0ecbd1ea19a5cf/156_345_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d079b6fb29489f241b32726686efd088","title":"from evasion to evisceration how the dominic cummings lockdown story unfolded durham","story":"As thousands died, the story of the PM’s top adviser waxed and waned in unpredictable ways. Its impact is as yet unknownThe first inkling of the story that shook Downing Street to its core came at the beginning of April.It was the first Sunday of the month, a couple of hours before the Queen’s stirring promise to the nation that, however hard it was to endure separation from our loved ones, “we will meet again”. Boris Johnson was seriously ill, and that evening it would be announced that the prime minister had been admitted to hospital.As it would turn out, however, one of the most consequential news events of the day was one almost nobody knew about. had been told that Dominic Cummings, the cartoon bogeyman of remain voters and the liberal left, was listening to Dancing Queen in his parents’ front drive.The Cummings family property is on a fast-moving A road and almost completely hidden behind bushes.The chances of anyone spotting a special adviser enjoying a bit of Abba during quarantine – much less recognising him – were slim enough that you could see why you might not be particularly worried about it. But as it happened, someone did see. And they wanted the  to know.Could Dominic Cummings, the architect of the “Stay home” campaign that every minister was imploring the nation to follow, really have gone to Durham?  asked a straightforward question of No 10. The response was enough to make you wonder: “It’ll be a no comment on that one. We wouldn’t get into locations of inidual members of staff.”That oddly evasive reply warranted further investigation. And by the end of that week, there was enough corroborating detail to go back to Downing Street. A new set of questions about the senior adviser’s locations, now loaded with specific details, was again met with a flat refusal to comment.It was Friday, 10 April. Exactly six weeks later, when the  and Daily Mirror made a final approach for comment before that evening’s publication, Downing Street would complain that they had not been given enough time.Over the intervening period, as hundreds more deaths were reported each day and the rest of the country wondered when the dull nightmare of lockdown would end, the story rushed forward and receded in unpredictable ways.The attempts to put the media off the scent, however, were not confined to gnomic remarks from Downing Street, which at one point had told another journalist that Cummings was “at home”.Cummings’ wife, Mary Wakefield, wrote a piece for the Spectator (subscription) – which she also read out on Radio 4 – that was so artfully constructed that on a casual read it seemed to rule out the possibility that the family had left their home at all.And surely Cummings would think it foolish to write a sidebar to this article, reflecting on the same period, if the family idyll he described was more than 250 miles from home?On a second look, though, both articles were curiously devoid of geographical specifics, until Wakefield finally referred to the family “emerging … into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown”. The line implied  they had been cocooned within the capital all along but, tantalisingly, stopped short of saying so outright.Downing Street’s reticence to come clean was understandable.In early May, the government scientist Prof Neil Ferguson was forced to resign after the Daily  splashed on the revelation that his lover had visited him at home. Cabinet ministers jumped on the indiscretion, proclaiming he was right to quit.But the wriggling and obfuscation would come to a spectacular end – and from an unlikely source.In response to a question from the Mirror, with whom the  had agreed to work, Durham police provided a statement confirming that the force had spoken to the family about Cummings’ visit.At 8pm on 22 May, both newspapers published their stories.The internet was swiftly awash with indignation and calls for the special adviser to resign.Downing Street was still declining to speak to the  on the record, while simultaneously providing other media with anonymous source quotes condemning the stories as “fake news”.Two of the country’s most eminent behavioural scientists got the news as they ate dinner together last Friday night, and immediately recognised the gravity of what had been disclosed, not as a matter of political drama, but as a profound risk to public adherence to the lockdown rules.“We looked at each other and said: ‘What is this?’,” said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London, whose wife, Susan Michie, is director of the same university’s Centre for Behaviour Change and a fellow attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies’ behavioural sub-group.“We had a very strong sense right away that something was up,” West said. “There were already concerns about how on earth we’re going to move to the next phase when messaging trust is ebbing away. And then this was like a bombshell.”The next morning, Downing Street provided the kind of detailed statement that the  had been seeking for weeks. But it brought as much confusion as clarity.A spokesman confirmed the trip, saying that it was “essential … to ensure his young child could be properly cared for”.That line – later justified by an explanation that a conversation with Cummings’ father had been at his request and primarily about security matters rather than a breach of lockdown – is understood to have caused consternation at the Durham force, which found itself at the centre of a political storm, and was forced to reiterate that a conversation had indeed taken place. (Two days later, it would say that the call focused on security.)But amid cries for clarity, little further information was on offer.Cummings refused to let Downing Street issue a statement on his behalf, the Sunday Times reported, with one insider being quoted as saying: “He insisted on handling it all himself.”If Downing Street had calculated that a stonewall strategy would make the story go away, they could hardly have been more wrong – thanks largely to a retired chemistry teacher. Robin Lees got in touch with the  via email. “Just read your report in the  and straight away reminded of an experience in Barnard Castle where I live on April 12th this year,” he wrote, before going on to describe his sighting of Cummings, and adding: “I went home and told my wife, but we thought he must be in London.”Lees had written down a number plate immediately, he added, and Googled it as soon as he got home – a claim corroborated by his search history.Hearing the transport secretary’s attempt to justify the visit by saying that Cummings had hunkered down and had not moved around, Lees was indignant. “Sorry if this has led you off at a tangent,” he wrote. “But Grant Shapps kept saying he stayed in one place!”After new stories were published by the Observer and Sunday Mirror that evening, featuring the Barnard Castle account as well as a separate allegation – consistently denied – of a later visit to the area, the “stay put” defence slid out of the government’s story, to be replaced by a fierce critique of “campaigning newspapers”.But if that was an attempt to define the subject as being one restricted to ideological left-wing interest, the response on Sunday and afterwards made it impossible to sustain. Led by the avowed Brexiter (and Cummings opponent) Steve Baker, Conservative MPs started to call for his resignation with tens of thousands of angry messages sent by constituents, almost 50 more had done so by Friday.The Daily Mail published a ferocious splash on Monday morning, with the headline: WHAT PLANET ARE THEY ON?Meanwhile, TV and radio producers reported difficulty persuading all but a small cast of loyalists to defend Cummings’ position on air, with one saying: “Quite a lot of the usual suspects were actually furious about it. If you listened, the same people popped up again and again.”Polls emerged showing a clear majority of the public felt the adviser had broken the rules, and ought to resign. It was time for the government to try a different approach: they promised us a rose garden.Like all good as, Cummings came out to greet his audience on Downing Street’s sunlit back lawn half an hour late. Despite the wait, his nearly unprecedented press conference drew a live TV audience of 5.5 million. In an extraordinary prepared statement, he laid out a complex story of difficult personal circumstances, ingenious and necessary solutions, and dismayingly compromised eyesight.Even as he spoke, though, there was little sense that the firestorm would abate. Steven Swinford, the deputy political editor of the Times, tweeted that cabinet ministers were unsatisfied: “He’s saying he’s so much more important than us plebs,” one told him. Another concluded: “We’re losing trust and confidence – it’s draining away before our eyes.”And there were oddities and inconsistencies even in the story that Cummings had set out in such extraordinary detail. Wakefield can drive, or at least could in 2000, when she wrote in a Spectator travel piece about a trip to Texas: “I drove for an hour every morning, slaloming past the road-rage wrecks of battered trucks, up the 135 from Dallas to Denton.”And if he had only gone to the “outskirts” of Barnard Castle, as he claimed, why had he been sighted parked up on the far side of the river from the route he was most likely to have taken?But such queries were unavailable to the journalists at the briefing, who, in line with normal Downing Street practice, had had to give up their phones before going in. The rose garden appearance did not calm the public mood – and, perhaps most troubling of all for a government seeking to have its messaging taken wholly seriously, stoked widespread ridicule. Memes abounded, including “Should have gone to Barnard Castle” riffs on the famous Specsavers ad. Staff could “hardly believe it”, said Maria Sattar, the opthalmic director in the company’s Barnard Castle branch, who noted that the spoofs “gave us a chuckle”. One Twitter account showed a page from Brewer’s slang dictionary which, if real, said “Barney Castle” was existing slang for a “pathetic excuse” deriving from a 16th century general’s refusal to leave his fortified position there to engage in battle. And the comedian Paddy McGuinness posted a reworked version of (Is This The\u0026nbspWay To) Amarillo, concluding in a rousing chorus of “sha la la la la la bullshit”.Durham’s acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, could sense the danger and urged the force to “establish the facts” around the claims.He’d been listening to the “vox pops” from Barnard Castle on the Sunday night news, not far from his home.“When people think that we’re fibbing, that we’re under the thumb of No 10, that’s when it starts to become an issue for me,” he said. “Seeing that dismay and anger at what people were hearing – we have to demonstrate that whatever else is going on, they can trust Durham police.“That’s when I had to act.” That move eventually led the force to the conclusion on Thursday that Cummings may have committed a “minor breach” of the lockdown rules.By then, 100 or more Tory MPs had criticised Cummings or called for him to go every ministerial briefing and interview had been dominated by the furore, and the government’s poll ratings had tumbled under the weight of middle-England indignation.Yet Cummings was still in place.The more significant question, of what this will mean for public adherence to lockdown and the new test-and-trace system, is yet to be answered.West, the behavioural scientist, says that an earlier resignation or admission of culpability would have been far better, but that the situation could still, theoretically, be improved.“It’s possible the damage will be mitigated by other people stepping in and saying: ‘Don’t do it for Cummings, do it for the community,’” he said. “But it’s like trying to climb an escalator when it’s going down. It’s not a question of whether lives will be lost now it’s a question of how many. But there is still some point in someone acting. Even too little too late can be enough, and in time.”For the sources who took the chance of coming forward, meanwhile, there has been at least some sense of vindication.Lees received an unsigned postcard addressed to the “Retired chemistry teacher” of Barnard Castle. “I presume this is for you,” the postal worker told him. “Thank you for being so brave,” the message read."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c6fe7c71a1617047e0735150847438851fde98c/0_93_4909_2947/master/4909.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=298ecb1714775132ab388abbec1b0d39","title":"justin trudeau george floyd reaction racism","story":"Prime minister condemned racism and called on Canada to ‘stand together in solidarity’ against racial hate as protests continue in USCanadians are watching unrest and police violence in the United States in “shock and horror”, Justin Trudeau said on Friday – but the prime minister cautioned that his country also has entrenched problems with racism.\u0026nbspThe city of Minneapolis\u0026nbsphas been rocked by a third night of violent protests over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, after a white police officer knelt on his neck as he lay on the ground following arrest.\u0026nbsp“Many Canadians of erse backgrounds are watching, like all Canadians are, the news out of the United States with shock and with horror,” Trudeau told reporters at a daily briefing.“Anti-black racism – racism – is real. It’s in the United States but it’s also in Canada and we know people are facing systemic discrimination, unconscious bias and anti-black racism every single day,” said Trudeau, calling on the country to “stand together in solidarity” against racial hate. “We have work to do as well in Canada.”\u0026nbspRacial inequities continue to persist throughout the country – a grim reality that is often apparent during interactions with police.\u0026nbspIn December 2018, the province of Ontario\u0026nbspreleased a landmark report\u0026nbspthat found black residents in Toronto – the country’s largest city – are 20 times more likely to be shot dead by the police than white residents.\u0026nbsp“It’s a very Canadian tradition to speak in platitudes, to refer to the underground railroad and to speak about Canada as a haven and a place that acknowledges its past mistakes,” said Robyn Maynard, author of\u0026nbspPolicing Black Lives. “But we continue to see similar structural harms and structural kinds of violence as we do in places where leaders make more overtly vitriolic statements towards black communities.”Last month, 26-year-old D’Andre Campbell was shot dead by police inside his own home, north of Toronto, after Campbell himself called 911.Earlier this week, the family of Regis Korchinski-Paquet said a police officer shoved the young woman over the balcony of the family’s 24th-floor apartment, where she fell to her death. The case is currently under investigation by an arms-length police watchdog.Maynard also pointed out the coronavirus pandemic continues to have a disproportionate impact on black and indigenous residents, who are overrepresented in the country’s prison population.“We continue to see prisons and jails being epicentres of outbreaks,” she said. “Yet there is failure on the part of the federal government to meaningfully release to release prisoners.”Trudeau’s unprompted remarks marked a notable departure for a leader who has gone to great lengths to avoid irritating his US counterpart, Donald Trump.Canadian prime ministers have traditionally refrained from discussing political and social turmoil in the US – Canada’s main ally and largest trading partner.\u0026nbspJustin Trudeau has long spoken about the need to tackle racism, but his re-election campaign was marred by pictures of him in blackface as a young man.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52b39e548ed53c6d33793cae2e39339eadd2dbeb/0_77_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=469ac35c2c771dd686d0c5fc4f7e7871","title":"pussy riot lastesis chilean group release manifesto against state repression","story":"Activists release manifesto, calling on civilians to set the institutions of the state on fire – ‘in a figurative sense’Governments around the world are using the coronavirus as an excuse to step up repression and push back civil liberties, warns a new song by Pussy Riot, released alongside a new manifesto written with the Chilean feminist collective Lastesis.The Russian activists and the Chilean group – whose song A Rapist In Your Path became a viral feminist anthem in 2019 – released the manifesto against police violence and state repression on Friday.“While we are confined, governments are intensifying the persecution of social struggles, tearing apart our rights, our freedoms,” it reads.The song – whose title 1312 is a numerical representation of the anti-police acronym ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards) –\u0026nbspstrays into nu-metal dissonance, with singer Nadya Tolokonnikova howling “ACAB try to catch me wow!”.The song refers to the wave of popular protest which erupted in Chile last year – and the violent police response which left thousands injured, including 445 people blinded by anti-riot weapons, and at least 30 dead.The five-month uprising was abruptly halted by the pandemic, but the groups’ manifesto warns that state repression in Chile and beyond has only grown worse as police and military enforce lockdowns.“Police act dangerously,” said Tolokonnikova, the Pussy Riot co-founder\u0026nbspwho was imprisoned for 18 months in 2012 for staging a protest in the Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow.\u0026nbspShe has also been beaten by Russian police during protests.“Instead of protecting people and investigating real crimes like rape or domestic violence, police persecute activists and protect those with power,” she added.Chile remains under strict lockdown, with obligatory quarantines enforced by police and army patrols.“It’s like living in an atmosphere of war,” said Lea Cáceres, a member of Lastesis alongside Dafne Valdés, Paula Cometa and Sibila Sotomayor. “We have armed police and military on the street simply to generate fear. They don’t help the community.”The manifesto echoes concerns\u0026nbspraised in a recent Amnesty International report\u0026nbspcondemning governments across the Americas for subjecting civilians to “excessive” repression “and obliging them to obey quarantines in “inhuman conditions”.In Russia, authorities have been accused of opportunistically using the lockdown\u0026nbspto monitor civilians using facial recognition, and infringe on civil liberties.“The Russian government is using coronavirus as a smokescreen to implement more laws to control citizens,” said Tolokonnikova, adding that she has “a lot in common” with Latin American activism. “We’re both fighting the oppressive system.”The manifesto calls on civilians to set the institutions of the state on fire – “in a figurative sense”, clarified Valdés. “We need to rebuild from zero,” she said.\u0026nbspTolokonnikova approached Lastesis after witnessing the impact of A Rapist In Your Path, whose message about structural misogyny resonated around the world and was picked up by activists in more than 50 countries.“I was amazed by their power to connect activists all around the world,” said Tolokonnikova, adding that she was “starstruck” when she first got in touch with the Chilean quartet.\u0026nbspThe two groups plan to continue collaborating on politically charged performances once the pandemic subsides.\u0026nbsp“Like Pussy Riot, Lastesis don’t see art as a mirror, they see it as a hammer to shape the world,” said Tolokonnikova. “With global solidarity, we can achieve really big changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2921cb5ffba6890612a9b48b4281c16dec37fc1/0_50_3477_2085/master/3477.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=04d61f9f1a116581fdcbb286c4cd0792","title":"uk lockdown rules what are the key changes","story":"Varying rules for meeting outside will apply in England, Wales and Scotland The prime minister announced on Thursday that groups of up to six people could meet outdoors in England from Monday, permitting what he described as “a long-awaited and joyful moment” as family and friends reunite after 10 weeks in lockdown. He set out the next stage in the easing of restrictions with a caveat that “there may still be some anomalies, or apparent inconsistencies, in these rules”.The UK government was yet to publish the promised guidance on the new rules on Friday afternoon but here is what has been announced so far.Yes. Whereas people in England were previously allowed to meet one person from another household outside while maintaining a two-metre distance, from Monday, groups of up to six will be allowed to meet. People will be permitted to congregate in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, instead of just in public spaces, as Johnson said “there is no difference in the health risk”.The prime minister said people should try to avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession, “so that we can avoid the risk of quick transmission from lots of different families and continue to control the virus”.The new rules apply to the over-70s but those considered extremely clinically vulnerable to the virus are still being asked to shield by staying at home.In Scotland, people from one household will be able to meet with another household outdoors in public spaces or a private garden from Friday, providing they maintain physical distancing. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the maximum number of people in a group should be eight.The approach in Wales is similar. People in a household will be able to meet with one other household outdoors from Monday. In Northern Ireland, groups of six are already allowed to meet outdoors. The Stormont executive plans to confirm the further easing of lockdown regulations after a meeting on 4 June but it is expected to allow small outdoor wedding ceremonies, attended by no more than 10 people.Yes. “You can even have a barbecue providing you do it in a socially distanced way, provided everybody washes their hands, provided everybody exercises common sense,” said the prime minister. . The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, added that those having a barbecue should remember they can spread the virus by passing things from one person to another.Yes and no. The UK government has said the science makes it clear the chances of spreading coronavirus is much smaller outside so socialising inside is not allowed.However, the prime minister said people could go through houses to access back gardens. Whitty also confirmed it was acceptable for people to use their host’s toilet, as long as they washed their hands thoroughly and wiped down surfaces afterwards.The Welsh government has also said it is OK for people to walk through someone’s home to get to their garden but they would be publishing guidance on how to do this safely.While people in England can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, they cannot stay over at people’s houses. “We don’t want people to go to other households and stay there. I’m afraid we are not at that stage,” said Johnson.In Wales people are being asked to stay local, which is defined as about 8km (five miles) from their homes. Sturgeon said there would be no legal limit on how far people in Scotland could travel but she said the strong advice was to stay within five miles.Yes. Outdoor retail such as markets and car showrooms in England will be allowed to open in England from Monday. Other non-essential shops can open a fortnight later, as long as they abide by the guidelines.In Scotland, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open from Friday. The Welsh government will decide whether non-essential retail will reopen at their next lockdown review on 18 June, though they said such businesses, which could comply with the physical distancing duty, should prepare to reopen.The UK government confirmed it was pushing ahead with plans to open primary schools in England to some pupils from Monday, giving headteachers three days of half-term\u0026nbspholiday to make final preparations. Nurseries and childcare providers in England are also being told they can reopen from 1 June. However, some local authorities have insisted schools in their area will not be opening.In Scotland, teachers can return to schools from Monday to prepare for\u0026nbspthe start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will do a mixture of at-home and in-school learning.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellTaoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed yesterday that primary and secondary schools would reopen at the end of August.Speaking to reporters, he said the Government realised it was not a “no-risk scenario but we know it’s a low-risk scenario”.While it may not be possible for every pupil to attend every school for the whole day every day at the start of school terms, he said, the intention was to reopen schools as “fully as possible”.Meanwhile, Department of Education officials are considering asking schools to keep groups of students or classes apart from each other at all times as a way of getting around social-distancing requirements when they reopen in late August.It is one option the department is examining as a way of ensuring as many students as possible can attend classes full-time, according to well-placed sources.Minister for Education Joe McHugh warned earlier this week all students would not be able to attend school even if social-distancing requirements were to be reduced from two metres to one. He said he would not accept a “half-return” with students attending school only some of the week.The option of allowing groups or classes to learn in a relatively normal classroom environment is likely to be attractive to policymakers.Ireland has among the most overcrowded classes in Europe and will face major capacity problems if social-distancing rules are implemented. There is also a shortage of qualified teachers.Mr McHugh’s officials are examining the experiences of countries such as Germany, France, Denmark and Greece in reopening their schools, which will feed into a plan for Irish schools that will be drawn up within the next fortnight.Dividing studentsThe idea of iding students in pods or groups was discussed during a department meeting with primary school stakeholders earlier this week.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation suggested the idea of “pods” of four children grouped together in a classroom.Another issue explored in the talks were challenges for special classes and special schools, especially where children have underlying health conditions.It is also understood the department is exploring the idea of a “tapered curriculum” when schools return.This involves adapting the school curriculum in light of restrictions linked to the pandemic. Some elements of the junior cycle are also being curtailed, with incoming third-year students now required to complete a single classroom-based assessment in most subjects, rather than two.Opposition parties, meanwhile, have criticised the Government over what they said were “mixed messages” over plans to reopen schools.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Unthinkable: Conceivable Future is fostering a personal but \u0026lsquodeeply political\u0026rsquo debateRite\u0026ampReason: A healthy planet is a prerequisite for a healthy humanityProtecting wildlife: Local says this is the third year in a row hedgerows cut at wrong time"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Antipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteriaAs top marine predators, dolphins accumulate the most man-made toxic pollutantsGlobal warming presents potentially damaging cascades of impacts, new study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, urged vigilance as the country heads into the last week of phase one of the relaxation of lockdown. “Moving into next week, I would urge everyone to look back at the progress we have made over the past number of weeks and maintain our efforts to suppress Covid-19 into the future.”The public health officials were speaking after Nphet confirmed that another six people have died with Covid-19 in the State, alongside a further 39 diagnoses of the disease. In total, 1,645 Covid-19 related deaths have taken place in the State, with 24,876 cases now having been diagnosed.As of midnight on Wednesday, data from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) shows that the median age of the 24,837 confirmed cases at that stage was 48 years. There have been 3,270 hospitalisations, of which 404 cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Dublin has the highest number of cases at 12,023, followed by Cork with 1,464 and then Kildare with 1,416 cases. Dr Holohan said: “It is encouraging to see ICU and hospital admissions declining, the number of new cases remaining stable and a 90 per cent recovery rate in the community.”‘Calculated risks’Asked about plans announced by the government on Friday to facilitate the return of childcare, including the introduction of so-called “play pods” in childcare facilities, he said such steps “represent calculated risks”. “We’ve been taking reassurances from what we’ve observed in other countries that have commenced earlier than us arrangements in terms of childcare and return to schools. There hasn’t been significant change in terms of the transmission of the disease resulting from those.”As public health officials learn more about the disease, Dr Holohan said he was preparing to add a loss of taste and smell to the list of symptoms that will make someone eligible for a test for Covid-19. He said that, following advice on the matter from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), the new criteria would likely be introduced by the middle of next week. As the country prepares to enter the last week before the scheduled relaxing of restrictions on June 8th, he said there were encouraging signs, but that data which will only emerge next week will play a key role in determining his advice on moving to phase two. “We haven’t seen anything yet, that’s encouraging, but we’ve another week to go yet.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4266182.1590799700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 pupils may be kept apart in groups and pods when schools reopen","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that it is the Government\u0027s intention to open all schools at the beginning of the school year in August.

However, if there are capacity issues, priority would be given to children of essential workers.Meanwhile, the State has changed how it is publishing details of Covid-19 deaths and is now disclosing the number of “possible” cases, along with those that have been confirmed or are regarded as having been probably caused by the virus.This week, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre started publishing information on the number of “possible” Covid-19 fatalities in the overall number, putting this figure at 10 per cent of all deaths.Previously, it only published a total aggregate figure for Covid-19 deaths in its daily reports that included both “confirmed” and “probable” cases but without disclosing the numbers of each.This week, it began providing a more detailed breakdown of the overall death toll in three categories, providing separate figures for confirmed, probable and possible deaths. Bank holiday vigilanceChief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the figures reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team every day have included “possible” cases in the probable figures and were all counted within the overall number of deaths announced each day.The HPSC defines a possible case as one that meets the clinical criteria of a suspect case and no alternative diagnosis, microbiological or non-infectious, has been found.The emergency team reported on Friday night that another six people had died with Covid-19 in the State, alongside a further 39 diagnoses of the disease. In total, 1,645 Covid-19-related deaths have taken place in the State, with 24,876 cases now having been diagnosed.Public health officials asked people to keep a record of who they meet over the bank holiday weekend, in order to aid contact tracing should they become infected with the virus as they will be “out and about” more with good weather forecast. Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump has said the US will be terminating its relationship with the World Health Organisation, claiming it failed to adequately respond to coronavirus because China has “total control” over the global organisation.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"EU commissioner is giving strong consideration to applying for post, sources sayMothers returning to work from maternity leave now eligible for State\u0026rsquos coronavirus pandemic wage subsidyDepartment considers plan that could allow most students return to school full-time in AugustPrimary and secondary schools to restart at end of August, Varadkar confirmsDifferences also emerge between FF, FG and Greens over Land Development AgencyHiqa alerted HSE to 212 \u0026lsquoat-risk\u0026rsquo residential facilities, records sent to committee showCouncillor says spending on graffiti removal is unsustainable and statue may be movedSomething is going wrong on the front lines, says INMO\u0026rsquos Phil N\u0026iacute SheaghdhaPresident urges rethink of housing, healthcare and precarious work on Late Late ShowChildren will be grouped into \u0026lsquopods\u0026rsquo of between six and 12 when sector reopensStudents will be refunded rent from the date they vacated accommodation to end of termCSO report shows a total of 421 lives were lost to suicide in 2019Countries announce list of foreign nationals who can visit this summer amid pandemicMichael O\u0026rsquoLeary criticises handling of reopening and says \u0026lsquothousands\u0026rsquo booking flightsParty has sent five-page proposal to local authorities and other stakeholdersSolicitor confirms action follows Gerry Adams\u0026rsquos successful appealFurther six deaths reported from Covid-19 along with 39 new casesFish with infection should not be taken from the water, authorities warnLack of social distancing causes local authority to act for June bank holiday weekendGovernment realised it was not a \u0026lsquono risk scenario but we know it\u0026rsquos a low risk scenario\u0026rsquo, said Leo VaradkarStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4266160.1590786011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish tourists excluded from visiting greece and croatia","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreece, one of the most popular countries for Irish visitors, has announced that visitors will be allowed from 22 European countries and seven other countries, which have largely dealt with their Covid-19 problems.

They are Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.Veljko Ostojic, the head of the Croatian tourism association, said the “crucial” move demonstrated that “Croatia is one of the first countries in the European Union to send a clear message from the highest level that it is open to tourism”.“As of now, 231 hotels and 86 campsites have opened, and all leading tourist firms have announced the opening of additional capacity in the coming days,” said Mr Ostojic, adding that safety measures had been implemented according to World Health Organisation (WHO) advice.The possibility of Irish people being able to travel abroad this summer has been heightened following comments by the UK health secretary Matt Hancock.In response to a question as to whether or not the summer was “cancelled”, Mr Hancock said he was a “little more optimistic” that Britons might be able to enjoy a foreign holiday, which could also apply to potential Irish holidaymakers as well.Mr Hancock told ITV’s This Morning programme that there might be the possibility of a tourist season this year after all.“I absolutely wouldn’t rule it out.

Photograph: Maxwell’sPresident Michael D Higgins has called for new and radical thinking about how to reform Ireland in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the provision of vital services and the issue of low pay and precarious work.In a wide-ranging interview on RTÉ’s Late Late Show, he also spoke of his “great faith in the Irish people going forward”, and urged a “generous, tolerant debate” about the future of the country.Asked what he thought of the term “cocooning”, he said “I don’t like the word at all. It would be better if you said “special care in isolation” or “assistance to self-isolate”.”He said that in relation to older people, “there were mistakes made in the language. We should not have fudged what was mandatory and what was discretionary.”Referring to his previous professional life as a sociologist, when he studied ageing, he said: “It took us a long time to get away from infantilisation, as we used to call it, in ageing ... we’ve got out of a lot of that, but we’re not fully out of it.”He revisited several times the issue of low pay in society, in particular for those working in frontline roles.The President praised the Irish people’s response to the crisis, saying “we have been responding with kindness, compassion and extraordinary generosity”.However, he said that a reappraisal of social issues such as housing, healthcare, elder care and precarious employment was needed.“For those workers in precarious employment, we owe it to them to go back with that precariousness removed ... we need to look how we can give a livable income to people not just to survive but to be able to participate in society.”“This is very, very different to 2008,” he said, “That’s why we need new thinking, radical thinking – and it’s there – and I hope there’s a generous, tolerant debate about it.”He paid particular tribute to the healthcare workers “who have died delivering an extraordinary courageous delivery of their work on behalf of the Irish people” and those who he said, in going to work, “are delivering themselves into the shadow of Covid every day”. He also praised lower-paid workers, saying “these are the essential workers in society without whom society couldn’t function”. He called for a “follow through” looking at the terms of their security of employment, conditions and pay.He also said the banking sector should “come to the table with an instrument which can deal with those who are having short-term liquidity” issues. He argued that “those responsible for liquidity will have to step up” when it came to businesses that are struggling.He said the chance existed for a “great promising moment” in how healthcare, housing and childcare and other services are delivered in the State.He made special mention of the people who had lost their lives in long-term residential facilities such as nursing homes. Speaking in front of a sculpture of the Plough and the Stars, where earlier this year he marked international workers day with union leaders, he praised also the courage of those who worked in such facilities.“There’s the deep stress of people who are working with such people, and whose colleagues may have come down with the virus and what kind of extraordinary commitment was it for people when, with staff going down all around them, to still try to keep going in these terribly difficult conditions,” he said.He spoke of his “great faith in the Irish people going forward,” but warned that “the very last thing we need are prophets of doom”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4266072.1590778817!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phil hogan exploring idea of wto director general role","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIf Phil Hogan applied and was successful in becoming WTO director general, it would mean the next government would have to choose a replacement commissioner.

Two weeks ago, the current WTO director general Roberto Azevêdo, a former Brazilian diplomat who has held post since 2013, announced he would end his term of office in September, a year before he was due to step down.Heavily criticisedThe WTO is responsible for setting trade rules and has been heavily criticised in recent years by US president Donald Trump.“He has not made up his mind,” a source added of Mr Hogan, who would hope to get the backing of the EU if he applies for the job.

Photograph: Andrew ParsonsAFP via Getty British employers will have to contribute to the cost of the coronavirus furlough scheme from the start of August, taking on a bigger share of the burden in subsequent months. Chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak said the government would continue to pay 80 per cent of furloughed workers’ pay in August but employers would pick up the cost of national insurance and pension contributions.From September, the government will pay 70 per cent of a furloughed worker’s salary, with employers paying 10 per cent. In October, the government’s share will fall to 60 per cent, with employers paying 20 per cent.“We stood behind Britain’s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side. Now, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining among the most generous in the world,” Mr Sunak said.From the beginning of July, furloughed workers will be allowed to be brought back to work part-time, a move business groups have pressed for as sectors such as non-essential retail prepare to reopen in the middle of June. Some 8.4 million people working in more than a million companies have benefited from the furlough scheme since March, at a cost of about £14 billion (€15.5bn) a month.BenefitsBusiness groups welcomed the chancellor’s announcement, although the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that sectors such as leisure, hospitality and the creative industries might need more help in the coming months. Labour’s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds welcomed the decision to allow furloughed workers to return to jobs part-time without losing all the benefits of the scheme.“However, it is concerning that there is no commitment within these plans for support to only be scaled back in step with the removal of lockdown. Nor is there any analysis of the impact on unemployment of a ‘one size fits all’ approach being adopted across all sectors.“The chancellor must publish the evidence behind these decisions to provide reassurance that his proposals won’t cause an additional spike in unemployment, and an even more difficult economic recovery from this crisis,” she said.The chancellor’s announcement came as Britain’s death toll reached 38,161, with 324 new deaths reported on Friday. From next Monday, groups of up to six people will be allowed to meet outdoors in England, including in private gardens.But with new Covid-19 infections in England running at 8,000 a day, John Edmunds, one of the infectious diseases experts advising the government, said it was too soon to loosen the lockdown.“The issue is, clearly there’s a need to try and get the economy restarted and people back to their jobs and so on, and also there’s a social and a mental health need to allow people to meet with their friends and families,” he said.“I think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that then means that we have fewer cases occurring before we relax the measures. I think at the moment, with relatively high incidence and relaxing the measures and also with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

But in a letter to the complainant, Jeremy Hayes, the corporation’s complaints director, laid out his opinions on Ms Maitlis’s approach and said aspects of the interview were “regrettable”.Mr Hayes said: “I have reviewed the programme. I agree that the interview cast more heat than light, including in the questions addressed to Mr Rees-Mogg about his reference to slavery, in a comment about the UK staying in the EU.“I can see that the repeated further questioning on this point by the presenter would have done little to aid audience understanding of the issues discussed.“The interview as a whole was combative, and the laughter of the presenter you described as ‘mocking’ did suggest that she was unwilling to accept his explanations.Mr Hayes said there was “some editorial justification” for Ms Maitlis’s forceful approach but added that he understood why the complainant felt moved to contact the BBC.He concluded that “while it will always be the aim of programme-makers to solicit answers which aid audience understanding of events, there is no guarantee this will happen. A failure to cast light on matters is of course regrettable - but does not necessarily constitute a breach of editorial standards.”The interview with Mr Rees-Mogg took place on March 28 last year. When the complainant first contacted the BBC, he received a reply saying that Ms Maitlis had simply been “robust” and a second response saying she had demonstrated “a degree of persistence” in her questioning.The complainant was dissatisfied and pursued the matter to the executive complaints unit, resulting in the personal communication from Mr Hayes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive coronavirus boost national lottery camelot prepares","story":"The National Lottery will announce record sales figures on Tuesday, marking a revival of the millionaire-making game that appeared on its last legs just four years ago.After being dropped from the Saturday night BBC schedule in 2016 after the ticket price controversially doubled to £2, its 25th anniversary year will mark the best 12 month’s sales in its history.Since its launch in 1994, the National Lottery has raised £41 billion for community projects, the arts, heritage and sport, where it is credited with helping Team GB to win 65 medals at London 2012 and 67 in Rio four years later.When it announced it was donating £600 million to the coronavirus relief effort last month, £20,000 of tickets a minute were sold in the run up to the first draw. Although the year-end results only include the first week of the coronavirus lockdown, people flocking to their local convenience stores rather than solely relying on supermarkets has also sparked a recent uptick.  Sir Hugh, a former minister under David Cameron and also chairman of the British Olympic Association (BOA), is hoping the global pandemic realigns the public’s priorities.While propelling EuroMillions winners onto the Sunday Times Rich List is all well and good, the former MP hopes “one positive thing that comes out of this is a renewed attention on what really matters in society”.“You hear people very regularly say, I met a young girl and I asked her what she wanted to do and she said she wanted to be famous. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice if the answer, after this is not, ‘I want to be famous’, but ‘I want to be a nurse’. Or I want to do something that puts back into society. And if this helps us make that change, all is not lost.”Of course Sir Hugh is under no illusion that people do play the lottery “to win” - and win big. He is the first to admit the introduction of EuroMillions in 2004 put players off the less lucrative Lotto.And even though he is not allowed to buy a ticket, he shares most people’s dream of winning the jackpot to “pay off off the mortgage”.While proud to declare “we simply wouldn\u0027t have come second in the middle table in Rio were it not for the National Lottery” and keen to point out it has funded big projects like the new V\u0026ampA museum in Dundee, the figure Sir Hugh relishes in is that 70 per cent of the grants handed out are for £10,000 or under. “There’s a huge legacy of, you know, cricket nets and football changing rooms and village halls,” he beams.Camelot is expected to bid again when the licence comes up for renewal in 2023 against probable competition from billionaire media mogul Richard Desmond, who runs the Health Lottery. The other main rival Sir Richard Branson is understood to have withdrawn from the race in light of the turmoil at Covid-hit Virgin. They have also faced competition from the People’s Postcode Lottery, who Sir Hugh accuses of not being “on a level playing field” because they “are nothing like as well regulated as we are, make no contribution to the Exchequer at all and don’t have to declare what spending money on.”Sir Hugh, who was installed in 2018, is “not embarrassed” to admit the National Lottery lost its way after the ticket price hike in 2013, followed by a misguided advertising campaign featuring unpopular celebrities like Katie Price, Noel Edmonds and Piers Morgan winning the jackpot when “It could be you”.“I was really worried in Rio, when I sort of got this sense that this wonderful thing might be about to go wrong,” he says. In response to the negative publicity, Camelot overhauled the board and executive, rethought the games and changed the prizes.Today, 60 per cent of over 16s in Britain play National Lottery games, each spending £5.19 a week on average.Part of last year’s sales spike was partly down to long string of successive EuroMillions rollovers - but younger players have also been attracted by “the new hierarchy of games”, including Set for Life.“I think society\u0027s changed in 25 years,” says Sir Hugh. “When all this started it was about fast cars and big yachts, glasses of champagne, big cigars and all the rest of it. Those values don\u0027t drive consumers any more. It’s seen as a bit vulgar now so actually to have a game to try to draw in the younger generation.“It’s more responsible, more sensible - a set amount of money every month for 30 years. It also proved surprisingly popular with older people, who saw it as a way to sort out the grandchildren.” An added bonus for OAP players is that the Set for Life jackpot is inheritable. Although the odds haven’t changed on your numbers coming up, players whose numbers come up are now guaranteed a minimum of a million, meaning a new millionaire is created almost every day in the UK. Since the lottery began, 5,500 millionaires have been made. Less than 10 per cent of jackpot winners go public - with Sir Hugh agreeing that people largely decide to stay quiet if they think they can hide it - easier with a million-pound Lotto win, than a double digit EuroMillions jackpot.“On the other hand I don\u0027t lust after yachts and fast cars or anything like that.The ability to be able to give a life changing amount of money to my old regimental charity, you know, to Help for Heroes, which I care about very deeply having been in the army.  And Canterbury cathedrals is another love of mine.”Reflecting on the fact that some lottery winners have been unable to celebrate, due to Covid-19, he adds: “It would be interesting to ask people after two months of lockdown, if they won the money whether they’d want to stay at home for a little longer. I’d imagine that a lot of them would prefer to go back to work!” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"huawei egalitarian beacon creativity instrument state expansion","story":"On the face of it, Huawei’s rise is the tale of founder Ren Zhengfei and his extraordinary lone-wolf battle with western corporate giants and Chinese state-owned behemoths. This is certainly the story Huawei would like to tell.Then there is the other version of events, in which Mr Ren is an ex-army engineer who never completely left the fold. He is said to have used his contacts to secure government loans and subsidies, to win state contracts and, according to the US, to shut down investigations.Over the last thirty years, Huawei has turned from an obscure import business into the world’s biggest supplier of telecoms equipment, boasting $122 billion (£99 billion) in revenues from 170 countries.Its exponential growth has also brought close scrutiny of the company’s relationship with the Chinese state, not least of the 100 senior employees who have connections to the Chinese military or intelligence agencies.One of those was allegedly Sun Yafang, the company’s chairwoman until 2018. According to a CV published on the website of her former university, she previously worked at China’s equivalent of MI6, the Ministry of State Security. Huawei denies this is the case.Read more: Revealed: the worrying links between Huawei, our universities and ChinaThen there is the question of who actually owns the telecoms behemoth?Huawei’s response is that it is a “private company” owned by its employees, after Mr Ren made almost 99 per cent of the business available to his staff to buy.  The company has a hefty “shareholder register” that it keeps in a glass case and breaks out for visiting journalists.But whilst it sounds democratic, the shares are only available to Chinese staff. Those moving jobs have to sell shares back to the company when they leave for another employer. They do not control company decisions.More fundamentally, Christopher Balding and David Weaver - two Mandarin-speaking professors expert respectively in Chinese business and Chinese law - claim that Huawei’s corporate structure grants control to a “trade union committee” – something Huawei denies.  There is very little public information available on the governance of this committee, but the Chinese norm is that trade unions are ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party and senior union officials are treated as state employees. In other words, they argue, Huawei is “in a non-trivial sense state-owned”.Huawei says this is incorrect and that the Trade Union Committee is a legal requirement to protect employee rights.“Huawei is an independent, privately-held company. We are not owned or controlled by, nor affiliated with the government, or any other third party corporation,” a spokesman said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"huaweis funding british chinese universities raises security","story":"Huawei is facing a fresh row over its influence in the UK, after a Daily  investigation found that it backed a string of technology projects linking British universities with Chinese universities that are heavily involved in military research.This newspaper can reveal that the controversial Chinese telecoms giant funded or co-authored at least 17 scientific papers with UK universities about cutting-edge “dual use” technologies – which can have civilian applications but can also be used in military technology.Some of the technology could be used to communicate with swarms of drones or on highly advanced image recognition software that could potentially be used for extreme levels of surveillance, according to analysis by three experts commissioned by this newspaper.The revelations come as China faces growing international hostility amid concerns that Chinese authorities attempted to cover-up the coronavirus crisis in its very early stages and intense criticism over its treatment of citizens in Hong Kong.Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong before it passed to China, said last week that a new security law imposed on the British territory marked a comprehensive assault on the city\u0027s autonomy, rule of law, and fundamental freedoms.Read more: Revealed: the worrying links between Huawei, our universities and ChinaMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo branded the Chinese Communist Party’s global ambitions as a “risk” to “freedom-loving countries”.In Britain, as revealed by the  last week, ministers are reconsidering their relationship with China in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, and drawing up plans to reduce Huawei’s involvement in UK infrastructure to zero by 2023.The ’s findings today will raise concerns over Huawei’s other forms of influence in Britain.Experts fear that UK universities may inadvertently sign up to projects whose work – published and unpublished - could compromise national security, or support an oppressive regime. They have also warned that Beijing may be using Huawei and UK universities to advance China’s defence programme.Tom Tugendhat, Conservative MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: “This investigation points to another worrying front in a soft war that China has been waging against us. We need to defend ourselves.”“The UK cannot be an unwitting partner with a regime that does not share our values and works against our interests.”Huawei has strongly disputed analysis of the papers by academics with specialisms in military technology and artificial intelligence. It said that it is a private company, and that the papers identified by the  focused on “common areas of research for telecoms equipment suppliers” It also has “strict rules” in place specifying that the research and development it funds at universities is for civilian use, a spokesman said. “We do not conduct military research either directly, or indirectly, nor do we work on military or intelligence projects for the Chinese government or any other government”.However,  experts have raised concerns over the potential for Beijing to influence Huawei\u0027s research funding decisions to enhance the Chinese Communist Party’s “military-civil fusion” policy.The policy was written into the constitution in 2017, on the order of by President Xi Jinping, and demands that all new technologies developed by China’s civilian sector – including technology companies and universities - are made available to the military.Tory grandee Iain Duncan Smith said: “China’s target is that in 2049 they are militarily more powerful than any other nation in the world.

But other attempts to forge close ties to the Western culture have much more serious implications.The  can disclose today that the controversial Chinese telecoms giant backed 17 scientific papers with UK universities, about cutting-edge “dual use” technologies – which can have civilian applications but can also be used in military technology.At least 15 of the papers focused on technology that experts claim could be used to communicate with swarms of drones or on highly advanced image recognition software that experts claim could be used for extreme levels of surveillance.All of them involve collaborations between British universities, including at Edinburgh and Exeter, and Chinese universities heavily involved in military research and named as high risk by an Australian think tank.The ’s findings today will raise fresh concerns over Huawei’s influence in Britain. Experts have also warned that Beijing may be using Huawei and UK universities to advance China’s defence programme, and a surveillance regime that is known for its human rights breaches.Alex Joske, a China expert at the think tank - the Australian Strategic Policy Institute - said: “Chinese military universities are collaborating with western institutions to take advantage of their expertise, resources and training in order to advance China’s military technology.”In one instance, academics at the University of Kent accepted Huawei funding for joint research on tiny antennae which, according to experts commissioned by The , could “get a swarm of drones to communicate with each other”.The study was done jointly with a known defence laboratory at the University of Electronic Science and Technology in Chengdu.A spokesperson for Kent said that the paper has military as well as civilian applications just as many other engineering areas, that it respects all UK trade restriction and that its students always declare any support from Huawei.Both Edinburgh and Exeter Universities said that the projects with huawei had undergone rigorous due diligence processes and ethical review and were reviewed on an ongoing basis.   Huawei has strongly disputed analysis of the papers by three experts, and insisted that the technologies they focused on were all “common areas of research for telecoms equipment suppliers”.A spokesman said: “Huawei is a private company that supplies telecoms companies globally. We do not conduct military research either directly, or indirectly, nor do we work on military or intelligence projects for the Chinese government or any other government”.It said Huawei had strict rules stipulating research and development cooperation with universities must be for the sole purpose of product development for civilian use, and dismissed the Australian think tank as having an anti-Huawei agendaIt also dismissed ASPI\u0027s findings, claiming that the Australian think tank has an “anti-Huawei agenda”.However, fears are growing that research undertaken as part of these collaborations will be passed to Beijing.There they could be used to bolster China’s extreme surveillance operation in Xinjiang, the western Chinese province where the Chinese government has imprisoned over 1 million ethnic Uighurs.Experts also fear that British academics may unwittingly find themselves working on technologies that are used to bolster China’s declared ambition to become the most advanced military power in the world by 2049.Last night, experts called for a shake-up of funding rules to ensure this does not happen.Professor Anthony Glees, director of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, called for universities to disclose funding deals, and a ban on UK institutions accepting Chinese backing for technology research that could be used in warfare.“It should be illegal to accept funding from China in areas where there is a military or national security relevance,” he said.Charles Parton, senior associate fellow at defence and security think tank RUSI, said: Research collaboration with China is not going to be black and white. We are talking about fifty shades of grey, and it is the government\u0027s role to set up a mechanism for deciding and ruling which shades of grey are acceptable.”Most universities have ethics boards to oversee funding, but there are currently no national standards for vetting funding before research takes place. The standard practice is for academics to declare their research partners and funding sources upon publication.In the US, universities are forced to declare any benefits or contracts worth over $250,000-a-year (£202,000) with “a foreign source”. In Europe, the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity demands that “researchers review” funding submissions “in a transparent and justifiable manner”.The scientific papers backed by Huawei and examined by The  were produced jointly with Chinese universities with specialisms in defence technology, which are ultimately controlled by Beijing or its military.The  commissioned three experts – with specialisms in military technology and artificial intelligence - to examine 18 publicly available studies undertaken jointly by UK universities and Chinese defence institutions.At least 17 of the studies were “dual-use”, so could be used for civilian services as well as for warfare or for extreme levels of surveillance. Experts were split on whether the eighteenth was also dual-use.Toby Walsh, professor of artificial intelligence at Australia’s University of New South Wales, said academics need to ask “tougher, more demanding questions” about their research partners because “the same algorithms you use to unlock your smartphone are now potentially being used to help kill people.”Bart Selman, professor of computer science at America’s Cornell University, said that a number of the papers were about technology that would allow better communication between “swarms of drones”.Another specialist – an expert on military technology who declined to be named for fear of repercussions – said that it is “almost impossible to deny a pattern of research” across the papers that could build up China’s “repressive technology capabilities”.All of the papers were backed by Huawei in some way – half through direct funding, and nearly all by Huawei researchers working on them.Five of the 18 papers were joint projects with China’s National University of Defence Technology – the in-house university of the People’s Liberation Army.Ten were done with Chinese universities that are part of Beijing’s “Seven Sons of National Defence” institutions, which are tasked with advancing China’s defence industry and are controlled by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.The remaining three were co-authored by academics in known Chinese defence laboratories. Some of the Chinese universities also face sanctions from the US and Japan because of their relationships with China’s military.One 2019 paper, called “Unequal Error Protection SCMA Codebooks”, was a joint project between the University of Surrey, Huawei and the National University of Defence Technology. Experts said it could reduce power usage while helping communications between drones.A spokesman for the University of Surrey, said Huawei was one of five supporters of its 5G Innovation Centre, which researches “machine to machine communications – commonly known as the Internet of Things. This research paper, alongside hundreds of others on the same topic publicly available around the world, looks at this important application of 5G technologies”. The experts who examined the studies also highlighted a paper by academics at Lancaster University and the University of East Anglia (UEA), who worked with scientists from Huawei and Beihang University, a Chinese institution that sanctioned by the US for its extensive work on rockets and drones.The 2017 study – “Recognition Using 3D Histograms of Texture and A Multi-Class Boosting Classifier”– involves programming cameras or drones that can recognise human actions which, according to all three experts, is useful both for video surveillance and developing autonomous weapons. Dr Walsh called the paper “troubling”.The Lancaster academic – Jungong Han – who worked on the paper in question insisted that the research had no military application, was “completely done in China”, and that his role was to provided “feedback on paper writing”. He added that Huawei might not have even known that its researcher was involved.A spokesman for Lancaster University said that the university did not receive Huawei funding for the paper and that it has “multiple potential applications”. “Our researchers are free to work with their counterparts in universities around the world,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"steve bannon starts recruiting alt right gladiator school italy","story":"Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former political strategist, is to start enrolling candidates for a “gladiator school” for Right-wing populists after winning a legal battle in Italy over the lease of an ancient monastery.Mr Bannon and his British acolyte were granted a 19-year lease on the 13th century abbey in the mountains south of Rome but it was rescinded last year by the Italian culture ministry, which accused them of failing to carry out promised improvements to the large complex.That decision was overturned this week by a regional court in the nearby town of Latina, meaning that Mr Bannon and his British assistant, Benjamin Harnwell, can resume their plans to turn the monastery into what they call the Academy for the Judeo-Christian West.Enrolments will begin on Monday and Mr Bannon, who has denied being a white nationalist, will be involved in courses that will cover politics, philosophy, history and economics.“We stood by the monastery, the community and Italy during this pandemic when it would have been easy to walk away,” Mr Bannon said from Washington DC, where he is based.The courses will initially be taught remotely, due to the coronavirus epidemic, but the aim is for the Trisulti monastery to host students from early next year.Mr Bannon, a founder of Breitbart News, the Right-wing news and commentary website, has been accused of being racist and a white supremacist. He once said that “darkness is good. Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That’s power.”There has been trenchant local opposition to the monastery being turned into a college for the nationalist alt-Right.The €101,000 annual rent on the property has now been paid and there are funds to start the restoration, he said.The culture ministry has announced it will appeal the court’s decision to a higher tribunal known as the Council of State. The appeal will be heard later this year.  “The restoration work will start when the legal process is exhausted,” said Mr Harnwell, who lives in the monastery near the village of Collepardo.After masterminding the successful 2016 election campaign, Mr Bannon fell out with President Trump and was banished from the White House.In early 2018, he was quoted in a book criticising the president\u0027s children. The comments completed his departure from Mr Trump\u0027s orbit. An increasingly isolated figure on the political scene, Mr Bannon has been rebuilding his influence through a podcast, WarRoom, alongside other conservative figures in the last year. He has remained a vocal supporter of the President\u0027s \u0027America First\u0027 agenda and there have been reports that he still talks to figures inside the White House about issues such as immigration. However his relationship with Mr Trump, who dubbed him Sloppy Steve on account of his beard and untucked shirts, has shown few public signs of thawing. Since leaving the administration, Mr Bannon has sought to bolster nationalist, populist parties in Europe, including the hard-Right League in Italy, the National Rally in France, Alternative for Germany and Fidesz in Hungary.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/28/16/courier.jpg","title":"couriers coronavirus testing samples delivery strike doctors laboratory","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Riders allege\u0026nbspNHS contractor The Doctors\u0026nbspLaboratory proposed to make certain employees redundant because they campaigned for better working conditionsMedical couriers delivering coronavirus testing samples for the NHS have voted to strike after the company employing them refused to offer the riders themselves tests.They also allege that NHS contractor The Doctors Laboratory (TDL) targeted eight couriers for redundancy because they had been active in campaigning for improved working conditions.The move is potentially another blow for the government’s new system to test and trace coronavirus infections which has been criticised by clinicians who say it is not ready, despite ministers’ assurances.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Thursday, couriers employed by TDL, a subsidiary of Australian firm Sonic Healthcare, announced they had decided to take industrial action after the company failed to address their health and safety concerns.A letter sent by TDL’s chief executive to one courier on 20 March stated that drivers would not be tested by the company as the government’s advice at the time was that this would add “no value”. Regular testing of couriers is still not being carried out but those with symptoms are now being tested, TDL said on Thursday.Whether ‘test and trace’ has been rushed or not – it’s a poor launchTDL describes itself as the “largest UK independent provider of highly specialised pathologyclinical laboratory services to clinicians (GPs and specialists), hospitals, community health services, and their patients”.Its network of couriers collect and drop off medical samples such as blood tests from hospitals and surgeries before delivering them to labs for analysis. During the pandemic they have entered hospitals with a high number of Covid-19 patients to pick up testing samples.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the couriers, says that this potentially puts them at high risk of infection but the company has not engaged with their safety requests. The union wants regular testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as full sick pay for workers who need to self-isolate because they are aged over 60 or have pre-existing medical conditions. It also alleges that TDL has not implemented proper social distancing in the company’s loading bay.The IWGB has filed a trade union and whistleblower victimisation claim against the company at the employment tribunal on behalf of eight of its members, who say they were targeted for redundancy on “bogus” grounds.The eight workers believe the company is attempting to make them redundant because of their involvement in previous disputes over issues including rider safety and pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It said only 46 of its 157-strong workforce had voted to strike based on “unfounded” allegations which the company categorically denies. IWGB said that 84 per cent of members who returned their ballots voted in favour of industrial action.A TDL spokesperson added: “It is inconceivable that TDL would deliberately expose any of its workforce, of whom its courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now. “All TDL’s health and safety protocols, which includes access to Covid-19 testing for those with symptoms, are compliant with current regulations and UK Government guidelines, are kept under constant review by TDL’s director of health and safety, and when they change, TDL’s protocols change with them.”The company said it proposed to make its team of 10 bicycle couriers redundant because of a downturn in the London area where they operate. A final decision has not yet been made.TDL cycle courier and IWGB couriers and logistics branch chair Alex Marshall said: “I’m incredibly proud of the work we have done during this pandemic. “TDL’s cycle couriers are among the best in the industry, have an impeccable attendance record and in times of tremendous stress have provided a model service to the community. “Instead of rewarding us, management has decided to take away our only means to feed our families in the middle of a pandemic. But the resounding vote in favour of strike action shows that despite management’s attempts to break us, we are more united than ever.”Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted in support of the couriers who he said had been “pushed to the limit” by their employer.Coronavirus: One in 15 people tested show signs of infectionTest and trace system plunged into chaos as NHS staff unable to log inTest and trace ‘won’t be fully operational until end of next month’What it’s like to work as a hospital chaplain on the Covid frontline“This issue needs to be addressed urgently by @MattHancock if the plan for testing \u0026amp tracking is to be effective,” Mr McDonnell wrote. “Sacking these couriers playing a key role in helping tackle the pandemic is completely counterproductive.”The government’s test, track and trace system got off to a stuttering start on Thursday, when an army of 25,000 contact tracers had been due to begin work.The programme’s first day was beset by problems and the government has admitted it will not be “fully operational” until the end of June.Several contact tracers told The Independent that they could not access the website when it launched on Thursday morning, with staff left unable to work.It is hoped track and trace will allow the country to come out of lockdown while still keeping control of coronavirus case numbers but some experts have warned that infection rates in the UK remain too high to implement the system effectively.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome 8.4 million workers are on furlough, meaning they are not working and the government is paying 80 per cent of their wages up to £2,500 a month.Firms will have to begin covering employers’ national insurance and pensions contributions for furloughed workers from 1 August.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?They will pay 100 per cent of wages for the hours that part-time furloughed employees are at work. In September, the government will pay 70 per cent of wages for the hours that a furloughed worker doesn’t work, with employers contributing 10 per cent. With NI and pension contributions, that will equate to employers covering 14 per cent of gross employment costs.In October the government will pay 60 per cent of wages with employers contributing 20 per cent – representing 23 per cent of gross employment costs. These costs will create an incentive for companies to get employees back to work where possible. It will also leave them with a decision to make about whether or not to keep some staff on.Mr Sunak said: “Now, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.”When asked about potential job losses when the changes are implemented the chancellor said: “There will be hardship ahead for many and that rests heavily on my shoulders.”He said the government would work to get people who lose their jobs back into employment as soon as possible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The job retention scheme is forecast to cost about £80bn by the end of October, though most analysts agree that the impact of not intervening adequately would have been far greater.Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the announcement, saying: “The government is giving hope to small firms right across the UK.”Frances O’Grady, general secretary of Trades Union Congress, said introducing part-time furlough earlier was the right decision. “This will help employers gradually and safely bring people back to work, protect jobs and support the economy to recover,” Ms O’Grady said.Why the furlough reforms risk a hard landing for the economy“As employers begin to contribute to the costs of furlough, we remain pleased that all workers will continue to receive at least 80 per cent of their wages for every hour worked until the scheme closes in October. However, the government needs to act urgently to make sure workers with health conditions or childcare responsibilities aren’t first in line when it comes to redundancies.”Kathleen Heycock, employment partner at law firm Farrer \u0026amp Co, warned that women are more likely to be in the firing line for redundancy as the furlough scheme is wound down.Mothers will be under “huge pressure” to manage competing work and childcare responsibilities, Ms Heycock said.“In reality, the threat of redundancies and instability in the job market may well mean women increasingly having to work longer hours to keep up with demands at work and at home, whilst fearing vocalising worries could leave them in a vulnerable position.“We must be wary that there is a risk of polarising an already hugely prevalent issue of the ‘maternity penalty’, meaning women taking time out to care for children either as formal leave or by part-time working suffer discrimination in the workplace.”Business groups and some think tanks had called for the government to adjust the furlough scheme in specific ways for different industries, giving more help to those businesses like pubs and restaurants that do not know when they will be allowed to reopen and which may be operating below capacity for a longer period than others.But the Treasury rejected the proposal, saying it was difficult to draw lines between who was deemed to work in which sector and would therefore be too complex to implement.Self-employed workers will be able to apply for a second grant from August which will be calculated at 70 per cent of average monthly trading profits up to £6,570 in total. That is less generous than a previous grant of up to £7,500 which covered 80 per cent of earnings. Some 2.3 million people have so far claimed under the self-employed income support scheme. The government resisted calls to extend support to those who are ineligible, including people who have become self-employed in the past year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Regular testing of couriers is still not being carried out but those with symptoms are now being tested, TDL said on Thursday.Whether ‘test and trace’ has been rushed or not – it’s a poor launchTDL describes itself as the “largest UK independent provider of highly specialised pathologyclinical laboratory services to clinicians (GPs and specialists), hospitals, community health services, and their patients”.Its network of couriers collect and drop off medical samples such as blood tests from hospitals and surgeries before delivering them to labs for analysis. During the pandemic they have entered hospitals with a high number of Covid-19 patients to pick up testing samples.The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents the couriers, says that this potentially puts them at high risk of infection but the company has not engaged with their safety requests. The union wants regular testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as full sick pay for workers who need to self-isolate because they are aged over 60 or have pre-existing medical conditions. It also alleges that TDL has not implemented proper social distancing in the company’s loading bay.The IWGB has filed a trade union and whistleblower victimisation claim against the company at the employment tribunal on behalf of eight of its members, who say they were targeted for redundancy on “bogus” grounds.The eight workers believe the company is attempting to make them redundant because of their involvement in previous disputes over issues including rider safety and pay.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailTDL strongly rejected the IWGB’s allegations. It said only 46 of its 157-strong workforce had voted to strike based on “unfounded” allegations which the company categorically denies. IWGB said that 84 per cent of members who returned their ballots voted in favour of industrial action.A TDL spokesperson added: “It is inconceivable that TDL would deliberately expose any of its workforce, of whom its courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now. “All TDL’s health and safety protocols, which includes access to Covid-19 testing for those with symptoms, are compliant with current regulations and UK Government guidelines, are kept under constant review by TDL’s director of health and safety, and when they change, TDL’s protocols change with them.”The company said it proposed to make its team of 10 bicycle couriers redundant because of a downturn in the London area where they operate. A final decision has not yet been made.TDL cycle courier and IWGB couriers and logistics branch chair Alex Marshall said: “I’m incredibly proud of the work we have done during this pandemic. “TDL’s cycle couriers are among the best in the industry, have an impeccable attendance record and in times of tremendous stress have provided a model service to the community. “Instead of rewarding us, management has decided to take away our only means to feed our families in the middle of a pandemic. But the resounding vote in favour of strike action shows that despite management’s attempts to break us, we are more united than ever.”Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted in support of the couriers who he said had been “pushed to the limit” by their employer.Coronavirus: One in 15 people tested show signs of infectionTest and trace system plunged into chaos as NHS staff unable to log inTest and trace ‘won’t be fully operational until end of next month’What it’s like to work as a hospital chaplain on the Covid frontline“This issue needs to be addressed urgently by @MattHancock if the plan for testing \u0026amp tracking is to be effective,” Mr McDonnell wrote. “Sacking these couriers playing a key role in helping tackle the pandemic is completely counterproductive.”The government’s test, track and trace system got off to a stuttering start on Thursday, when an army of 25,000 contact tracers had been due to begin work.The programme’s first day was beset by problems and the government has admitted it will not be “fully operational” until the end of June.Several contact tracers told The Independent that they could not access the website when it launched on Thursday morning, with staff left unable to work.It is hoped track and trace will allow the country to come out of lockdown while still keeping control of coronavirus case numbers but some experts have warned that infection rates in the UK remain too high to implement the system effectively.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If it has water and oxygen, it could potentially be home to\u0026nbspalien lifeA planet the size of Earth has been confirmed around the closest star in our solar system, Proxima Centauri, by an international team of scientists.The planet, called ‘Proxima b’, has a mass of 1.17 Earths and is located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, which the planet orbits approximately every 11 days, according to the new paper published in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.The first indications of the planet’s existence were in 2013 by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire from archival observation data, with continued research following in 2016. It is believed this planet could be “likely” to be able to support alien life forms.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers detected this planet by measuring radial velocity using the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) which is installed on a telescope in Chile. It is three times as accurate as HARPS, another spectrograph which has been used to measure the velocity of Proxima Centauri.Radial velocity, in relation to a given point, is the rate of change of the distance between an object and that point. As a planet orbits a star, its gravitational pull causes a star to move back and forth. This tiny motion shifts the observed light spectrum of the star slightly due to Doppler shift, which can be detected with sensitive instruments.Everything you need to know about SpaceX launchA low disturbance in Proxima Centauri’s speed, detected by ESPRESSO, tipped researchers off to the presence of the planet. Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Michel Mayor said that ESPRESSO makes it possible to “measure the mass of the planet with a precision of over one-tenth of the mass of Earth”, which he describes as “completely unheard of.Proxima Centauri is approximately 4.2 light-years from the Sun, but Nasa estimates it would take approximately 73,000 years for us to reach the planet unless new technologies are developed.Ionic propulsion, nuclear thermal propulsion, nuclear pulse propulsion, fusion rockets, and laser sails have all been considered as methods to travel to the planet.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzle30 years of space wonder began with a vital but underwhelming imageSpace Force launch: Robotic rocket plane blasts off on secret missionAstronomers find \u0027regular rhythms\u0027 coming from distant starsSpace debris from failed rocket misses New York City by minutes“We were already very happy with the performance of HARPS, which has been responsible for discovering hundreds of exoplanets over the last 17 years,” said Francesco Pepe, a professor in the Astronomy Department in UNIGE’s Faculty of Science in a statement. “We’re really pleased that ESPRESSO can produce even better measurements, and it’s gratifying and just reward for the teamwork lasting nearly 10 years.”Alejandro Suarez Mascareño, the article’s main author, said: “Confirming the existence of Proxima b was an important task, and it’s one of the most interesting planets known in the solar neighbourhood.”Although Proxima b is about 20 times closer to its star than the Earth is to the Sun, it receives comparable amounts of energy. If there is liquid form on the planet, it could harbour life, but researchers said there is still much to be done before that can be confirmed. “Is there an atmosphere that protects the planet from these deadly rays?” said Christophe Lovis, a researcher in the University of Geneva’s Astronomy Department, “and if this atmosphere exists, does it contain the chemical elements that promote the development of life?”It is also possible that there could be a second planet orbiting the star, as the research team found evidence of a second signal in the data – but was unable to determine its origins. “If the signal was planetary in origin, this potential other planet accompanying Proxima b would have a mass less than one third of the mass of the Earth. It would then be the smallest planet ever measured using the radial velocity method,” said Professor Pepe.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSome 8.4 million workers are on furlough, meaning they are not working and the government is paying 80 per cent of their wages up to £2,500 a month.Firms will have to begin covering employers’ national insurance and pensions contributions for furloughed workers from 1 August.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?They will pay 100 per cent of wages for the hours that part-time furloughed employees are at work. In September, the government will pay 70 per cent of wages for the hours that a furloughed worker doesn’t work, with employers contributing 10 per cent. With NI and pension contributions, that will equate to employers covering 14 per cent of gross employment costs.In October the government will pay 60 per cent of wages with employers contributing 20 per cent – representing 23 per cent of gross employment costs. These costs will create an incentive for companies to get employees back to work where possible. It will also leave them with a decision to make about whether or not to keep some staff on.Mr Sunak said: “Now, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.”When asked about potential job losses when the changes are implemented the chancellor said: “There will be hardship ahead for many and that rests heavily on my shoulders.”He said the government would work to get people who lose their jobs back into employment as soon as possible.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The issue has now been resolved and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.The outage came as users across the country rely on their connections to work and study from home. While the internet infrastructure has stayed largely stable despite the new working patterns, any outage can very quickly cause widespread problems.Problems were reported right across the country, according to Down Detector. While the area around London, Cardiff and Birmingham saw the most reports, that is likely to be simply a result of where most people are trying to get online.TalkTalk\u0027s status website suggested that all of its services, including broadband, were still online. We\u0027ve no reported issues with Broadband right now, a message on the site read.But the company\u0027s official Twitter page was being sent a flurry of reports, to which it replied with apologies and sent users back to that service status page.It had not sent out any public tweet acknowledging the issues or giving any indication of when they might be fixed.Earlier this month, regulator Ofcom said that internet speeds were largely performing as normal, despite some high-profile outages.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: London on lockdown Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks down a deserted Camden High StreetGoodge Street Station is one of the many stations closed to help reduce the spreadAn empty street in the heart of ChinatownPeople in masks in Chinatown a day after the lockdownA near-empty Piccadilly Circus during the first week of lockdownSonja, my neighbour, who I photographed while taking a short walk.

Users can decide whether they want everyone to be able to reply, only the people they follow, only people they directly mention in the tweet, or nobody at all.The company is also testing asking users to “revise” their language when tweeting rude or harmful content, and a way to see who has replied to your tweet in a quoted-tweet.Trump claiming to use \u0027powers he does not have\u0027 to shut down TwitterZuckerberg says Twitter shouldn\u0027t be \u0027arbiter of truth\u0027This is the most honest Trump has ever been with the American peopleTwitter refuses widower\u0027s plea to remove trolling Trump tweetsThis news comes as the social media site is being challenged by Donald Trump over decisions to took to fact-check one of his tweets that made misleading claims about the relationship between postal voting and election fraud. Mr Trump has since signed an executive order against the company limiting its protection under Section 230, a law which which prevents tech firms from being held legally responsible for the content they allow on their sites. Following riots in Minneapolis after a man called George Floyd died in police custody, Mr Trump tweeted a message calling the protestors “thugs” and said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!”Twitter added a label hiding the tweet, saying that it “violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence”.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Felix Project has supplied 1,376 tons of produce since 23 March, the equivalent of 3,276,190 meals. This support has ameliorated the deep distress of those unable to afford or access food – in particular, families struggling below the breadline, NHS workers and the elderly.The sum raised from sales of Hirst’s rainbow butterfly hearts means that we are more than halfway to our goal of securing £10m for The Felix Project to help food-poor Londoners over the next three years. It is a pledge given added urgency by the latest jobless claims, which have surged to more than two million.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 4,400 people backed our campaign by purchasing the Hirst limited edition prints – 3,109 bought the small size, costing £300 each, and 1,299 bought the large size, costing £1,000. The net proceeds amounted to £1.55m. Mr Hirst said: “It’s amazing to see how people have pulled together and helped each other during this crisis. I am so grateful to everyone who has helped me do my little bit and bought a butterfly heart edition – it’s turned out to be a brilliant communal way to help raise money for The Felix Project and support their important work across London.”How to support our campaignEvgeny Lebedev, shareholder in The Independent, said: “I have long believed in the power of art and this is a wonderful affirmation of that. With the support of Damien Hirst we have passed the halfway point in our mission to ensure no Londoner in any corner of the city goes hungry because of Covid.”Other substantial new donors to our campaign include management consultants McKinsey \u0026amp Company, whose employees voted to make our appeal partner their charity of choice.Olga Nefedova, associate partner, said: “We are making a donation to organisations helping our most vulnerable communities. The Felix Project is very much one of these organisations.”So far, more than six million meals have been delivered by the London Food Alliance – established in response to the coronavirus pandemic and made up of Felix, FareShare and City Harvest – of which over half have been supplied by The Felix Project.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, paid tribute to the extraordinary all-round effort. “London was hit hard and fast – but oh, how it has stepped up and fought back,” he said. “We are inspired by the mobilisation of businesses, donors and supporters who have joined forces with our staff and volunteers.” The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

It was from a newly formed charity, The Felix Project, that wanted to use surplus food that would otherwise go to waste to feed the poor. The star of The Walking Dead and Britannia promptly called them to ask if he could volunteer.That first session — delivering fresh produce to eight different charities — made such a vivid impression on Mr Morrissey that he has since become regularly involved with Felix, now his favourite charity. “I was very impressed by the efficiency and simplicity of the operation, and yet at the same time it’s difficult because a big part of me wishes that The Felix Project didn’t have to exist,” he said.“You wish people didn’t have to rely on food parcels in London in this day and age, but the harsh reality is they do.” He added: “A lot of the people we give food to, they are proud people and a lot have jobs — but they’re still finding it hard to make ends meet, to support their families.” Often, admitted the 55-year-old, the people he delivers to recognise him. At Haringey Play Association, an adventure playground in the shadow of the new Spurs’ stadium, Mr Morrissey would arrive in his green Felix van to the amazement of the kids.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“There’s a bit of, oh my gosh, is that the governor off The Walking Dead?” he laughed. “It’s fun but you very quickly get over that and after a while they relate to you as a real person.”How to support our campaignMr Morrissey, inset in Britannia, introduced chef Melissa Hemsley to Felix and together they would join children at Haringey Play to cook up a storm with Felix delivered ingredients. “That was my best part,” he said. “Those cooking sessions with the kids at Haringey Play, I have never laughed so much.”He has also taken along his 25-year-old son to volunteer and helped fundraise by manning the phones along with actors Sir Ian McKellen and John Hamm.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis.

Each box is packed with goods such as ready meals, fresh fruit, vegetables, tinned goods, nappies, tampons and soap.On the involvement of the young estate volunteers, he said: “They just want to be involved and have been engaged from the start.

Over a million people have signed the petition, thousands have been in contact with their MPs, and polls show 63 per cent of the public want the prime minister to take his responsibilities seriously and show Mr Cummings the door. “Most worryingly, leading public health experts and police officers have warned that the Cummings scandal has eroded public trust in the rules and those who make them – putting lives at risk.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The government has appeared to invite hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents to make UK citizenship bids amid concerns over China’s planned national security law, which critics warn would eviscerate the notion of “one country, two systems”.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the UK would allow the roughly 300,000 people in Hong Kong who hold British national overseas (BNO) passports to stay in the country for 12 months, instead of the current six, unless China scraps the proposed law.He added that by allowing BNO passport holders to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months, this would “provide a pathway to future citizenship” – stopping short of pledging definite amnesty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe diplomatic gambit came as Mr Raab and his counterparts in the US, Canada and Australia published a joint statement warning the law “would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous”.Noting that “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom”, they emphasised their “deep concerns” and warned China’s planned law was “in direct conflict” its obligations under the principles of the Sino-British declaration, agreed when Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997.Created with Sketch.Pro-democracy protesters return to Hong Kong streets Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A pro-democracy protester is detained before being arrested by undercover police during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayJournalists gather round a pro-democracy protester in Hong Kong shopping centre on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters sing songs during a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers clear a shopping centre of protesters on 10 MayRiot police wearing protective masks stand guard during a demonstration outside a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers patrol the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront where protests are scheduled to take place on 10 MayRiot police stand guard in a shopping centre during a pro-democracy protest on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained by an undercover police officer during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained before being arrested by undercover police during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayJournalists gather round a pro-democracy protester in Hong Kong shopping centre on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters sing songs during a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers clear a shopping centre of protesters on 10 MayRiot police wearing protective masks stand guard during a demonstration outside a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayPolice officers patrol the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront where protests are scheduled to take place on 10 MayRiot police stand guard in a shopping centre during a pro-democracy protest on 10 MayPro-democracy protesters stage a rally at a shopping centre in Hong Kong on 10 MayA pro-democracy protester is detained by an undercover police officer during a protest calling for the city\u0027s independence in Mong Kok district on 10 MayThe foreign ministers warned the unprecedented move risked undermining trust in Beijing during the coronavirus pandemic, when governments should be striving to enhance it, with Mr Raab adding: “We urge China to step back from the brink.”However, 2,878 members of China’s mostly rubber-stamp parliament voted in favour of the law on Thursday. One delegate voted against, and six abstained.The legislation will make “any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion” in Hong Kong a criminal offence, and will allow China’s national intelligence agencies to set up bureaux in the city.Communist Party officials will now draft the new legislation and it could be in force before the end of the summer.The violent protests that rocked the city for much of 2019 after a proposed extradition bill quickly reignited with the new proposals, with tear gas once again stinging streets pounded by thousands of masked demonstrators and armed police.​The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I am shaking with anger right now. This is the best they can come up with?“Extending a f***ing worthless document for Hong Kongers (who can pay for themselves to be here for longer than 6 months). They are already here, Raab.“This is a worthless 12 month tourist visa unless he is saying if you live here for a year, UK will give you citizenship.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Zhao accused Washington of interfering in China’s internal affairs and said Beijing would take any necessary countermeasures.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.Taking London as an example, with a current R value of . for coronavirus, it means that for every ten people who have the virus, it will be passed on to only four more people.The low R value means thateveryone continues lockdown and social distancing measures, London would theoretically be virus free by the end of May. The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R stood somewhere between  and ..The UK is now generally below that because of the lockdown and the social distancing measures we have been doing over the past two months.In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value changes with place and time.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.The most recent estimate of the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and .Below R is the important bit because it means the virus will likely peter out, but things are generally worse in the north of England to the point that the trend could reverse.New data released May  from Cambridge University suggests that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..The South West has an R rate of ., slightly more than the North West which has a rate of ..Both the East of England and South East have a rate of ., followed by the Midlands with . and finally London with ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.During one of the Downing Street press conferences, Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that it was highly likely there is an R value in the community of less than one.This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus outbreak as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However, when the number remains higher than one, the epidemic will grow. Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.Sir Patrick said that the draconian social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is less chance for the virus to spread.He said on Thursday, April : The social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level.At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax.It’s important to keep the R below one, and this is all about trying to reduce contacts, particularly between households, reduce transmission and keep the levels low across the community.And Sir Patrick added that even small changes in the measures that are in place could lead to the R going above one.According to a pre-print study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the average number of people an inidual comes into contact with each day has dropped by  per cent since the UK’s lockdown began.“This would be sufficient to reduce R from a value from . before the lockdown to . during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective,” the study, which tracked over , adults and has not yet been peer reviewed, concluded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls. I don’t know how I’d prove it to the Danish customs people.Maybe just show them a photoshopped picture of me and Maja out on the town.Anyway, that’syou WANT to visit Denmark.I went there once and was pretty underwhelmed. It was like a middle-class version of Lincolnshire.SO what exactly have YOU accomplished during lockdown A few jigsaw puzzles and watched the entirety of Netflix Listen to this. In  the Bubonic Plague struck London once again. Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus. And then he discovered the laws of gravity.Oh, and formulated a theory of light which dominated science for the next century and beyond. All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France. Good for her.Since the turn of the year more than , illegal immigrants have arrived on our shores from our neighbours.Brexit Britain is an even more popular destination than it was before we left the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

possibly as low as  per cent.This will also allow for extra cleaning precautions to take place.So, these physical changes will have to be set out before a practice can safely open.Before your appointment, patients will be called to be made aware of social distancing measures, sanitiser stations and may be asked to wear a mask.Catherine Tannahill, director of clinical dentistry at Portman Dental Care has been working on how to update procedures over the last few weeks in order to minimise the spread of Covid- and to keep staff safe.Before visiting the practice all patients will be called and briefed on the new procedures in place, so they will know exactly what to expect.We may also require them to complete anda new medical history form digitally ahead of their appointment.People will be encouraged to have used the toilet, brushed their teeth and are well hydrated before leaving the house for their appointment.Once patients arrive at the practice, they may be asked to wait outside before coming in for their appointment.Catherine Tannahill, director of clinical dentistry at Portman Dental Care said there are many things you can do to make sure you look after your oral health during lockdown.DosDonts Ms Tannahill continued: “We would also ask that people come to appointments alone where possible and to bring as minimal personal belongings as possible with them.“Patients will need to call the practice upon their arrival and either have to remain in their car or stand outside, practising the social distancing recommendations, until one of the team members unlocks the practice door and invites them in.The doors to the practice are likely to remain locked until staff are ready for your appointment.Patients who are waiting outside will be called when its time to enter the practice.Theres likely to be temperature checks on the door and people will be asked to verbally declare whether they have coronavirus symptoms or not.Once inside, patients may be given a masktheyre not already wearing one and made to wash their hands.Waiting rooms are likely to be out of bounds and items such as magazines, TV remotes, water coolers and toys will be removed.There will be markers on the floor - just like in supermarkets - to indicate m distances, but its understood most practices will ask people to wait outside until their appointment and will go straight to the treatment room.Reception staff will sit behind a perspex screen for added protection and people will be asked to use contactless payment where possible.Patients may even be asked to use their own pensthey need to sign forms andnot a pen will only be able to be used once, its understood.If a patient needs the toilet once inside they should only do so with the permission of staff, as the area will need to be deep cleaned.Before patients enter the treatment room, they will be asked to leave their coat and bag in a box provided.They will then be asked to wash their hands once again and depending on the treatment, patients may be asked to swill with a hydrogen peroxide solution for one minute.Dental staff will be in full personal protective equipmentas they will be working within the safe social distancing recommendations.Once the procedure is over, patients will be asked to sanitise their hands once more before leaving the treatment room.The entire room will then have to be cleaned and disinfected before seeing the next patient.Its thought appointments will have a - minute gap to allow time to safely sanitise between appointments.The report states: Patients’ appointments should be spread between - minutes to allow for enough time to disinfect all areas and avoid cross-infection between patients in waiting rooms.One of the main reason dental practitioners have not been allowed toto work is due to a lack of PPE.Many of the tools used by dentists, such as drills, can spray germs widely so adequate protection is vital.Face masks can cost anything from £-£ and NHS England says FFP face masks are needed for all aerosol-generating procedures.One dentist said a lot of practices are rushing to get PPE orders in order to allow time for fit testing.While the cost of most PPE has soared, protective gloves have also doubled in price from some suppliers.Not all staff will have to wear gloves - receptionists will only have to wear surgical face masks.Despite this, the use of PPE is dferent in every area and some hospitals in London have been using two sets of gloves for protection.Other forms of PPE include disposable gowns and these can range between £-£.NHS England states that clinicians should wear disposable plastic aprons for non Aerosol Generating Procedures .While the advice ied for patients who were suspected to have Covid, the general consensus of the report what that clinicians needed to wear a higher level of PPE than usual in order to protect themselves.Ms Tannahill added: “As dentists we obviously can’t carry out social distancing when performing routine check-ups and treatments, so the teams will be in full PPE gear and minimal colleagues will be in the treatment rooms, which will then be fully cleaned and disinfected after each patient.“This means that there will be longer waiting times between patients, and so practices will be on a reduced number of patients that they are able to see in a day. Therefore, patients who are vulnerable or are in need of urgent dental care will be prioritised in the first instance once we re-open.When it comes to the sort of kit dentists will need to reopen, PPE is at the top of the list. But other items have also been suggested that may help make things run a bit smoother.While there have been no studies showing that air puriers help stop the spread of the virus and some have said the costs are so low that many dentists may get them just to show their patients that they are doing all they can.Dentist Neel Kothari told Dentistry Online: There are a few glaringly obvious issues with air puriers.Firstly, we as clinicians will always be between the patient and the unit. Secondly, there is a distinct lack of evidence demonstrating effectiveness and finally,needed, what standard do we require Could we end up spending a lot of money only to be told they need to be upgraded However, to many dentists the costs of the units are a relatively inexpensive way to demonstrate to their patients that they are doing everything they can to ensure safety.This is while other parts of kit such as suction systems could set practices back over £, - and its an amount many may not be able to afford after being shut for such a long time.The systems are used to reduce the amount of aerosol used and could be a quick solution for many practices.While its clear every business that reopens after the lockdown will have to adhere to a stricter cleaning regime, its unclear as to how this will actually be implemented.The report stated that most countries were no longer using the spittoon in dental procedures.In order to avoid viral cross contamination it was also suggested that paperwork and other items in the office be kept to a minimum.It was also recommended that practitioners switch between treatment rooms in order for sufficient time to be given to disinfect each room to a high standard.Common contact areas such as handles should be covered.The report also stated: The door of the surgery must remain closed to prevent viral spread. One guidance document expands on this to state all drawers and cabinets should also remain closed.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every day I walked down the corridor of my high school in New Zealand to that sort of abuse. “F***ing faggot.” “You poofter.” “Bum boy.” You can imagine.I became prepared for it and engineered a steely exterior. But each incident made it harder for me to be the person I knew I wanted to be and even more aware I was an outsider in a world where straight men dominate.While attitudes are thankfully changing, they still extend across many industries.One of my early bosses in newspapers told me recently that an editor had resisted hiring “the poof” .Luckily, that boss — a mentor during my career who happens to be straight — held firm and didn’t accept such blatant homophobia.I’m never one to moan about a lack of ersity or embrace identity politics — all minorities have to fight to overcome stereotypes. Taking on a victim mentality doesn’t help, which is why I never have.But it’s far too simplistic to look at Queer Eye, Graham Norton and Tom Daley then declare homophobia doesn’t strangle careers even now.That said, Adrian Chiles’ illuminating interview in The Sun this week with Luke Tuffs, who came out as a teenage player at Camberley Town in Surrey, provides reason for hope.Now manager of Ashford Town, he revealed that when he first told his team-mates in a drunken moment of madness they were “absolutely cool” about his sexuality. Of course, there’s “savage” banter in the “un-PC” dressing rooms but he explained: “I don’t think it comes from malice — it comes from love.”In fact, I’d hazard a guess the banter would be just as brutala player had ginger hair, an overweight girlfriend or a small willy. Banter is a prized part of British le and must not be wiped out by the snowflake brigade. It’s very dferent to abuse.The closeted players should also look to Phillip Schofield’s coming out announcement. What the This Morning host probably believed was going to be a le-changing event, dominating his every waking moment, has now been largely shrugged off. It was a damp squib in the best possible way.Sure, Phillip is gay. But he’s still hosting This Morning with Holly and that’s what people talk about. We don’t care who he is sleeping with.It is, of course, a deeply personal choice, but I would encourage footballers living miserably in the closet to try to change the way they think about coming out. Being the first will give them an opportunity no one  will ever have.While some archaic football fans may not be ready for it, I genuinely believe the vast majority of the country and our culture truly is.The opportunities will be limitless. The love will be overwhelming.Thirty years of fear will be turned on its head. We just need one brave announcement.Andwe’re not careful the red tape and draconian restrictions will kill off an already struggling high street.Take shoe shops, where staff will have to quarantine any footwear tried on for  hours.If you’ve worked in retail you’ll know how damn impractical that is.And,we’re being guided by the science, who the heck has ever contracted coronavirus via their toes while wearing socks Clothes shoppers will not be able to try on items in a changing room. Why not just order on Amazon then Estimates suggest these corona-ready measures will also cost companies. A lot. To the tune of £, a store, according to one estimate.Making the shopping experience miserable for retailers and customers won’t help save our economy, given recovery requires people wanting to go out and spend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

held on May  but only published today - warns that phase four is highly likely to push the crucial R rate above  - meaning that the epidemic would grow.They suggest phase  could kick in around August , and would involve all kids heading back to school in September, most leisure facilities being open and most people being back at work.The documents state: As things currently stand, Phase  of the modelled options is highly likely to push R above .This phase of the option involves more extensive relaxing of measures across a range of areas.Sir Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientic Adviser and member of Sage, said last night that the R rate is currently somewhere between . and ..Once the R rate creeps above one, it means every infected person can go on to infect more than one other person - causing the epidemic to grow.Below one means the epidemic is starting to shrink.Based on the Sage modelling, the UK will enter phase  on Monday, after Boris Johnson announced people will be able to see friends and family outside, while maintaining social distancing and some schools can reopen.The Sage documents show that for any further easing of the lockdown to happen safely - pubs and restaurants reopening for example - very effective contact tracing is essential.But they warn reopening businesses like hairdressers, nail bars and other personal care services could see infection hot spots, like those seen in care homes.People working in businesses involving close, sustained contact with many people, however, could have levels of infection as high as those seen in social care, as well as increasing transmission in the community, the documents state.It comes as one member of Sage today warned that the Government is taking some risk by relaxing lockdown measures while the number of new cases of coronavirus remains relatively high.Prof John Edmunds, who sits on the Sage committee, said many experts would prefer to see the number of Covid- infections drop further before measures like meeting up with family and friends are introduced.He said: If we had incidents at a lower level, eventhe reproduction levelwent up a bit, we wouldnt be in a position where we were overwhelming the health service.I think at the moment with relatively high incidents, relaxing the measures and with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here.Eventhat risk doesnt play out and we keep the incidents flat, were keeping it flat at quite a high level.Lockdown measures are set to be eased as part of step two of the Governments roadmap to get the economy back up and running.Schools will reopen on Monday for reception, year  and year  while outdoor retailers and car showrooms will be allowed to open their doors again.The next step - stage three - is set for no sooner than July  when hairdressers, pubs, hotels and cinemas could get the green light.On changing lockdown measures, they urged that changes are based on the incidence levels and data and not on a set predetermined date.They also examined the R number when the range was between .-., saying it is likely to be at the lower end of this rangehealth and social care settings are excluded, showing hospitals and care homes were driving transmission.Sage has published research papers and records of their meetings today to show their thinking behind the lockdown.Some  discussions, attended by experts such as chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, have been made public.They start with the first Covid- meeting on January  and the most recent is from May .Typically Sage publishes the minutes at the end of an emergency, but the exceptional nature of the pandemic has prompted the unprecedented drive for transparency.Sir Patrick said: During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers.Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why its important we dont wait to publish minutes and evidence.Professor Whitty added: The background papers and minutes will help make clear what scientic knowledge was able to tell us at particular points in time, and where there was, and often still is, uncertainty about what we know about this new disease.The Government said the meetings that took place after May  still contain sensitive information, with police advice still under live consideration, so will be published in the weeks to come.In the latest meeting available, on May , the scientists discussed the approach to forming social bubbles, where a limited number of people would be able to come into close contact.They noted a safe approach would need the isolation of all members in a bubble, adding: This would lead to increased frequency of isolation for people, particularly in winter months.Those months are of particular concern to the experts, having discussed on May  that testing capability to test index cases in the tracing programme in less than  hours will be essential.They raised concerns thatthe capability is not reached by the flu season, then a large number of those reporting Covid- symptoms may not have been infected with coronavirus.Also in that meeting, they stressed that  per cent of an iniduals contact would need to be traced for the programme to be effective.They warned that there is a risk iniduals become less willing to complythey are repeatedly asked to isolate and are impacted financially, heaping pressure on ministers to ensure there is sufficient support.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The furlough and self-employment schemes have been a leline for millions of people and businesses.“We stood behind Britain’s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side.“Now, as we begin to re-open our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world.”Firms will not be able to furlough new staff beyond June  so the changes will only affect those who have already been put on the scheme.This means firms have until June  to furlough new staff because of the three-week minimum period they must currently be out of work for.Employers wishing to furlough staff part-time must reportThe scheme operates UK-wide, with no dferences across the four home nations.The Government will cover  per cent of wages up to £, in September, with employers to pay National Insurance and pension contributions and  per cent of wages, representing  per cent of the gross employment costs.The following month, the Treasury will pick up  per cent of wages up to a cap of £,, with employers paying tax contributions and  per cent of wages, representing  per cent of the gross employment costs, the Government said.It added that only  per cent of businesses had claimed the pension contributions since the scheme was launched.Since it was launched, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been used by one million businesses to support . million jobs, at a cost of £ billion so far.The scheme is expected to cost a total of around £ billion, or £ billion a month, although the Office for Budget Responsibility is set to publish detailed costs next week.Business groups had asked the Government to ensure that those industries suffering hardest were most protected.But the Treasury said it was not always clear which sector a business was in, insisting it would not rule out future supportrequired.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I want to reassure people that this support will continue.I’m extending the scheme, so eligible self-employed workers can claim a second grant as we kickstart the economy.We stood behind self-employed people as we came into this crisis.

This will ensure self-employed people who may only have been adversely affected from June onwards will be eligible for income support.But in a blow to nearly a million small business owners, the Treasury has confirmed it will not be offering extra help to directors of limited companies who pay themselves in idends.Many brickies, plumbers and entrepreneurs pay themselves in idends, making them ineligible for the Self-Employment bailout scheme.The Treasury said it was impossible to design a scheme that distinguished them from people who earn idend income through shares, who do not need state handouts.The Federation of Small Businesses hailed the extension of support - saying it will help save millions of livelihoods.FSB boss Mike Cherry said: “Our five million-strong self-employed community will be greatly relieved to know that the income clf-edge they were facing in two days’ time has now been removed.“The hope is that more and more sole traders will be able toto work safely as restrictions are eased.“Policymakers have rightly recognised that self-employed business owners working in a lot of sectors – not least hair  beauty, events and travel – will be massively impacted by the current downturn for many weeks to come.”The boss of the British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall said: “The extension of support for the self-employed will come as welcome relief for those who have seen their livelihoods impacted by the virus.

But here’s the thing. A public inquiry shouldn’t waste its time working out who’s to blame. Because we already know that. It was the Chinese halfwit who kept his raw pork chops in a shed full of bats.No, the whole point of a public inquiry is to make sure that when the next pandemic comes along, we are better prepared to deal with it.And we don’t need a  of buffoons and buffoonesses to work that out, because we already know.We look at what the Germans did. And do that.On the first day back, he turned up to find that nothing had arrived.Not a single thing. Except, bang on the dot of am, a truck pulled on to the site, with the windows from Germany.FOR the past few weeks I’ve had a minor ear infection. I’ve spoken about it often. And being a man, moaned about it even more.I’ve even bought drops from the chemist, and then moaned about how they weren’t working.And now, weirdly, every time I go online I’m faced with an endless barrage of revolting adverts and photographs showing me how to get wax out of a clogged lughole.Much the same thing happened recently when I googled shipping containers and how they could be converted into garden offices.For the next month I got bombarded with shots of big metal boxes. Is my laptop listening to what I say  I can only presume it is.Well that’s fine. If it knows what subjects are erting me at any given moment, I’d like to express an interest this morning in what Abbey Clancy would look like in a swimsuit, on a yacht.Better, I should imagine, than someone pulling gunk out of their ear while sitting in a shipping container.DOMINIC Cummings was doing very well with his garden-based chat this week.His shirt was tucked in, he wasn’t rude or dismissive – and when he explained why he’d taken his we and young son to Durham, it made perfect sense to me.He was winning. But then came the question about why he’d subsequently gone to Barnard Castle and enjoyed a walk in the woods.Now. The correct answer would have been. “Yup. My bad. The kid was going stir-crazy in the house. Stupid I know, given that I helped write the stay-at-home rules but there you go. We all make mistakes. Soz.”I’d have bought that and we could have moved on.But instead he came up with a ridiculous story about going for a drive to test his eyesight and, all of a sudden, the man became a laughing stock.This was right up there with Ron Davies MP, who said he’d been on Clapham Common late at night because he was, er, looking at badgers.So now the Left is howling for Dominic’s blood and throwing eggs at his car and camping outside his house with their beards and their vegetarian shoes.Finally, they’ve got the architect of Brexit and they’re going to bring him down.Hmmm. So where were they when Alastair Campbell – another unelected government official – sexed up the document about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction That’s what we need to remember. He took us to war. Whereas all Dominic did was take his kid for a walk.Oh, and to be clear. I voted Remain.APOLLO  laid to rest any notion that space travel is particularly dficult.Because those three guys were up there in a leaking ship that had been smashed by an explosion, with less computing power than you’ve got in your iPhone and less electrical power than it takes to run a toaster.When they made it back to Earth safely, it proved you could probably go to the moon in a cement mixer.That being said, I am looking forward to the rescheduled launch of Elon Musk’s Space X mission.Not because it’s the first manned craft to take off from American soil for nine years, but because they’re going to use a rocket to get the astronauts into space.Then bring it back to earth and land it vertically on a ship, so it can be used again.If they can pull that one off, I will be VERY impressed.BOSSES at Thames Water are seeking a new home for a giant iron screw that’s twice the height of a giraffe and heavier than a hippopotamus.I was quite interested in using it as a garden ornament until I learned that the ft piece of ironmongery has been used for  years to deal with human effluent at a sewage plant in Hampshire.WE are coming to the end of the annual National Camping And Caravanning Week.Which this year, because of Covid-, was rebranded as the National Camping And Caravan Stay Home Week.Members were invited to spend the night at home or in their tents or caravans, and to then donate to the NHS the money they’d saved by not travelling. What a great idea, and let’s hope it was such a massive success that organisers decided to keep it going.Not just for one week of the year.

So the fact that Dominic’s Adventures In Wonderland – which was broken by my colleagues Pippa Crerar and Jeremy Armstrong last Saturday – has dominated the agenda all week, hints that The Blind Hatter’s actions were pretty scandalous. But you knew that. As did the police. And every Tory MP. The real scandal is that Dominic Cummings is still in a job and that his deputy, Boris Johnson, is hastily bringing forward policies which fit with his master’s latest soundbite: It’s Time To Move On. Suddenly we’re doing Trace and Test when it looked likely to come in around the same time as Trick or Treat, and pubs may be opening next month, presumably to get us all blind drunk so we can’t see Barnard Castle.Of course, we will eventually move on from this cautionary tale about people who made the rules breaking the rules and seeing no wrong in it. But the details won’t be forgotten and hopefully neither will the main lesson – that vast swathes of ordinary voters were conned into thinking they were being held in contempt by a wealthy elite when those words summed up the conmen. Last December, millions voted for Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, neatly packaged as a colourful man of the people whose burning ambition was to take on the Establishment. When the only aim of the self-serving Old Etonian, who called his £,-a-year wage for writing a Dailycolumn “chicken feed”, was to rise as far as his bluster would take him, dropping everyone he’d used along the way. A man as down to earth as his co-conspirator Jacob Rees-Mogg, whose we’s ancestral pile, the -room Wentworth Woodhouse, is the UK’s largest private house. Cummings wants to be seen as the Johnny Rotten of Westminster, the elite-loathing maverick who spits on the Commons’ mace. Yet, like Johnson, yet he too went from private school to Oxford and likes hanging around in aristocratic circles. So much so that he married the daughter of a Baronet, Sir Humphry Tyrrell Wakefield, who owns Chillingham Castle in Northumberland.

It only opened in December last year and staff were ramping up production on the new DBX when it had to close its doors. But with the majority of staff at the car plant now back at work, the company has followed Government guidelines on how toto work safely - as well as implementing its own initiatives. Remarkably, every employee is given THREE dferent facemasks on their first day back at work. .  Thataposs not part of government guidelines, says James Stephens, Director of Government and External Affairs at Aston Martin, but we think where there is a small chance of stopping additional spread of infection, we will issue all our staff with face masks. On day one, you are issued with three: one for the morning, one for the afternoon and one for the following morning. On day two you would put your mask on before you get out of your car.  The car giant is also implementing the new measures listed in the official government advice for firms. They have instigated one-way systems. There are two-metre spaces as staff queue up at the entrance to the plant. Hand sanitisers are provided at the door and throughout the building, and the canteen has adapted to only serve pre-packaged food.  People are also encouraged to check their temperature before they go to work and stay homethey have any symptoms of the virus. “Security and health and safety staff will take your temperature from a safe distance,” says James. If it’s high, staff are asked to sit aside before being retested. “Some people might cycle to work and might have a slightly elevated temperature for that reason.”The Government has issued advice for workplaces to reduce the risk of infection, including keeping staff in fixed teams, staying a safe distance apart and limiting face-to-face contact. Regular cleaning, increased hygiene and floor markings are also advised.  Walking, cycling or getting to work by car is ideal, butworkers have to use public transport they should travel off peak, use contactless payment, wear a face covering and maintain a -metre distance.

Its owner, International Airlines Group, has been accused of using the coronavirus crisis to impose a long-held aim to wreck workers’ terms and conditions.Unite said BA is to fire its entire , workforce and rehire those who survive on “totally new, lesser contracts of employment”. Fry said: “It really does look as though British Airways’ board is using the pandemic as cover for some brutal behaviour.” And Westwood added: “Surely the Government cannot allow this to happen ” Hart, endorsing Unite’s “BA Betrayal” campaign, said: “Last year, each staff member generated £, in pure profit.”  Mission Impossible star Newton used Twitter to share a link to an online petition against the cuts, which has now had more than , signatures. Asked this week about the proposed redundancies while BA is using the Government’s furlough scheme, PM Boris Johnson said: “I’m aware of this issue and we’re actively looking at what can be done.”The Mirror has been inundated with emails and messages from BA crew members after highlighting the issue.  One worker said their confidence and mental health had been “destroyed”. Another said the impact had been “hellish”.

Len McCluskey, of Unite, said: “There is growing public opinion against BA’s grotesque behaviour. BA is using this health crisis as cover to impose a long-term plan to slash jobs, pay and conditions.

The pilot landed on a runway at RAF Valley on the island of Anglesey, North Wales, on bank holiday Monday. He was believed to have flown from an airfield in Surrey as he wanted to go to the beach, despite it being in breach of the coronavirus lockdown rules for Wales, a source told the PA news agency. It sparked an emergency response from Ministry of Defenceguards and fire crews, the RAF confirmed. It is understood that, upon landing, the pilot taxied his single-engine turboprop plane to the far side of the airfield, near to the beach, where he was confronted by guards. RAF Valley is home to No  Flying Training School, which is responsible for training fighter jet pilots and aircrew involved in maritime operations. Workers were said to be carrying out repairs and maintenance on the airfield at the time of the incident, and no bird control unit was in place. After security checks were carried out, the pilot decided to take off again, despite the airfield remaining closed, the RAF said.  An RAF spokesman said: The RAF can confirm that on May  a civilian PC- aircraft landed on a closed runway at RAF Valley without permission. Whilst irregular, it was assessed that there was no threat to station personnel or the wider public. The incident has been reported to the Civil Aviation Authority .  The spokesman said the pilot was not in distress. While the RAF does accept civil aircraft at its stations, -hours notice is required to ensure they do not impact on military activity. By landing on a closed airbase, it meant that appropriate fire and rescue cover was not in place, the RAF said, adding there was no immediate danger to other military aircraft.

Yet, like Johnson, yet he too went from private school to Oxford and likes hanging around in aristocratic circles. So much so that he married the daughter of a Baronet, Sir Humphry Tyrrell Wakefield, who owns Chillingham Castle in Northumberland.Plastic Johnny shot to fame alongside the self-proclaimed Brex Pistols, Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, when they seduced the British people into believing that a privileged clique in Brussels had been conspiring against the working class for decades. And plain-speaking blokes like them were destined to save them from the Enemies of The People.That#xs Farage, the ex-public school stockbroker, who said Brexit had left him #xCskint#xD despite having two EU pensions, a five-figure radio presenter#xs salary and a #xAmillion house in Cha. And Banks, another private schoolboy who became a multi-millionaire insurance salesman and diamond mine owner.The political history of the past decade, both in Britain and America, is of millions of working-class people giving power to wealthy scam artists who duped them into believing they had their best interests at heart.When all their heart desired was to get richer, more powerful and, as we#xre seeing with this Cummings cover-up, look after their own.As the real Johnny Rotten asked the crowd at the end of the Sex Pistols#x final US gig: #xCEver get the feeling you#xve been cheated #xD:People socialising over bank holiday weekend urged to keep track of who they meetPeople socialising over the bank holiday weekend have been urged to keep track of who they meet.

A document released today shows behavioural experts have warned the governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciescommittee of low compliance with the new NHS track and test system. Under the programme people in England will be told to quarantine themselves for two weeksthey come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-. The experts said: We strongly recommend monitoring and rapid research into adherence rates to all key behaviours and how to improve them, noting that based on DHSC tracker only around % of people are currently reporting self-isolating for at least seven days when symptomatic with cough or fever.The scientists advising on the coronavirus response have published research papers and records of their meetings to show their thinking behind the lockdown.Minutes of the  discussions between members of Sage were released, along with research documents. The meetings, attended by experts such as chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, start with the first Covid- meeting on January . Typically Sage publishes the minutes at the end of an emergency, but the exceptional nature of the pandemic has prompted the unprecedented drive for transparency. In the latest meeting available, on May , the scientists discussed the approach to forming social bubbles, where a limited number of people would be able to come into close contact.  They noted a safe approach would need the isolation of all members in a bubble, adding: This would lead to increased frequency of isolation for people, particularly in winter months. Those months are of particular concern to the experts, having discussed on May  that testing capability to test index cases in the tracing programme in less than  hours will be essential. They raised concerns thatthe capability is not reached by the flu season, then a large number of those reporting Covid- symptoms may not have been infected with coronavirus. Also in that meeting, they stressed that % of an inidualaposs contact would need to be traced for the programme to be effective.  They warned that there is a risk iniduals become less willing to complythey are repeatedly asked to isolate and are impacted financially, heaping pressure on ministers to ensure there is sufficient support. On May , Sage stressed that alterations to retail, leisure and schools not pushing the transmission rate R above the crucial number of one are dependent on an effective test and trace programme being in place. And, in a blow to hairdressers, they recommended against reopening personal care services as an earlier alteration, because they typically rely on highly-connected workers who may accelerate transmission. On changing lockdown measures, they urged that alterations are based on the incidence levels and data and not on a set predetermined date.  They also examined the R number when the range was between .-., saying it is likely to be at the lower end of this rangehealth and social care settings are excluded, showing hospitals and care homes were driving transmission. Sir Patrick said: During one of the most serious pandemics in our recorded history, people are understandably concerned and worried about what the future holds and are looking to the science for answers. Openness and transparency around this disease is a social imperative, which is why itaposs important we donapost wait to publish minutes and evidence.

Campaigners also say HS will not be carbon neutral for  years. Contractors have now started work on the high-speed line between London and Birmingham, set to cost around £billion. But images taken last week showing the extent of work carried out so far at Crackley Woods near Kenilworth, Warwickshire, have angered campaigners who say the “devastation” has taken place during a time when the woodlands should be “bursting into le” and at a critical time for nesting birds. They also criticised the decision to move ancient woodland soils to a new site, attempting it at the wrong time of the year and using a contractor with no experience. The Woodland Trust said the move was “like getting a bike mechanic to service a Boeing.” Trust ecologist, Luci Ryan, said: “The heart has been ripped out of these irreplaceable woods in prime breeding season.”  The RSPB has urged HS not to clear woods during the April–September nesting season.Destruction of active birds’nests is illegal and the charity has asked locals to report any incidents they see to the police.The RSPB said: “HS isn’t earning our trust and sadly we’ve seen evidence that nest site exclusion zone concerns from local residents are going ignored.” Five ancient woodlands are the focus of HS works – Crackley Woods, Broadwells Wood, Birches Wood and Ashow Road Wood in Warks and Fulfen Wood, Staffs.

Yet slicing through clouds at ,ft with a team of fellow fighters, Cooke intuitively knew when to hold steady as Lippett, behind him in the machine gun turret, aimed and fired. The other gunners did the same. In those fleeting seconds amid the cloying mist over Dunkirk, Cooke could see the whites of the Germans’ eyes. And he could clearly see their fear, too. “I could see the pilot and navigator duck at each burst,” he later wrote in his combat report. “Then the enemy aircraft engines went on fire and stalled. The enemy aircraft burst into flames on landing.” Two days later – May ,  – Cambridge rower Cooke, , and factory worker Lippett, , took down eight aircraft, which earnt them the title of Ace, making them the Second World War’s first Aces in a single day. Cooke told a reporter: “It was like knocking apples off a tree.” Cooke, Lippett and others from  Squadron, flying Boulton Paul Defiant aircraft, provided vital aerial cover to the , Allied troops leaving Dunkirk in the highest evacuation figure on any day of the campaign. Operating alongside Spitfires and Hurricanes,  Squadron took down  enemy aircraft. It is a record that still stands. They lost none of their own machines, and just one man – and that was an accident. He mistakenly bailed out amid the confusion of battle thinking his hit aircraft was finished. In fact his intrepid pilot, Pilot Officer Desmond Kay, managed to get it home. In total, over the course of the evacuation,  Squadron took down  aircraft, more than any other squadron, and lost just eight. We are well-versed in the evacuation of Dunkirk the historic rescue of some , troops by the Royal Navy and  intrepid British “Little Ships” who came to their aid. But as we mark the th anniversary of the “miracle” of Operation Dynamo this week, it is important to recognise the huge contribution of  Squadron and its Boulton Paul Defiants, overshadowed in history by the iconic Hurricane and Spitfire.  The Defiant, with a central turret armed with four Browning machine guns, played a crucial role in protecting the ships and men below, allowing so many to escape. Cooke and Lippett’s victory celebrations on May  were short-lived. Two days later their aircraft was shot to smithereens and the men reported missing, never found. Author Robert Verkaik tells in his latest book Defiant: The Untold Story of the Battle of Britain, how the aircraft has been almost erased from history. Subsequent failings of the Defiants in the Battle of Britain did not help its cause, but over Dunkirk, its achievement was awesome.  “The Defiant was a very British, idiosyncratic design. No other airforce had a fighter with a turret. It was state of the art,” he explains. “Even Churchill championed it. He said the turret fighter would be paramount in the coming battles.” While the Germans had , aircraft at their disposal at Dunkirk, and would have hundreds waiting in the skies, striking the Royal Navy ships, and the men awaiting rescue, the RAF had four squadrons in the air at most – up to  aircraft. They were also hampered as they needed enough fuel to fly across the Channel, andhome, which meant just  minutes in combat.  The Defiants would fly with Hurricanes or Spitfires to down enemy bombers, while more Hurricanes would go above to take on fighter jets. “They would have been able to see the men lining the beaches,” says Robert. “If you wanted to know why you were in your small squadron against an overwhelming number of German fighters, you only had to look down and that would motivate you.” He says the Defiant was “blooded” during Operation Dynamo, but partly because of its surprise element, the aircraft, which could provide concentrated fire to the rear and side – but not the front – was very effective.  It may have been slower than its counterparts, but was deadly. He explains: “The Defiants would work in partnership, catch the slower-flying bombers, and fly alongside them and shoot from the sides, or from underneath. And as the bomber tried to get away there would be another Defiant waiting for it. “The Germans were used to getting on the tail of a Spitfire or Hurricane, butyou go on the tail of a Defiant that’s where they want you.” The Defiants had already had success in the early days of Operation Dynamo, but May  was to be their D Day. From RAF Manston in Kent the pilots needed no navigation tool to find their way. Black smoke spiralling ominously from the burning oil refinery in bombed-out Dunkirk was crystal clear. They could just follow it.  Two sorties set out that day, flanked by Spitfires and Hurricanes. The first was around noon. It was a clear day, and they were an obvious target for the Luftwaffe. Robert says: “With powerful binoculars you could see them leaving the White Clfs of Dover. There was no element of surprise.” That day, the Luftwaffe were relentless, mounting five attacks on ships in Dunkirk. Yet just two minesweepers were lost. The Defiants were defiant. Alongside Cooke and Lippett were another winning duo, Pilot Sgt Ed Thorn and gunner Leading Aircraftman Fred Barker, the highest kill scoring Defiant duo of the Second World War, with  to their names. On the th, they single-handedly engaged three Messerschmitt Me  fighters, shooting them all down. Six enemy aircraft had ed on their team, and the three Defiants at the back got cut off. Seeing their danger, Thorn and Barker swept to the rescue, picking off the trio of attackers and saving their pals. “It was exceptional bravery,” says Robert. “The pair survived the war, but Thorn died in  on a jet test fight. Barker never really got over it.” That night, the RAF was jubilant. Although the evacuation was to continue for a few more days, the tide was turning at Dunkirk. “The Defiants were celebrated, it was a massive boost to morale. This was an extraordinary triumph, they played their part, they were heroes,” says Robert. The May  mission made front pages, and a photo shoot was held at RAF Duxford. Although a group shot pictures only the pilots – generally upper-class – while the generally working class gunners are missing. It had been a gunner who was the single Defiant casualty of May . In the chaos and noise of action, radio communication between gunners and pilots would often be lost. It was not rare for a gunner to lose consciousness when a pilot ed, because of gravitational force, or to be hit by enemy fire, and the pilot not realise. “Often the pilot got the plane back and found the gunner dead in the turret,” explains Robert. On May , it was Leading Aircraftman Evan Jones who died. His turret took a hit and he bailed out. His body was washed up on the shores of Dunkirk. But ultimately, the “miracle” of Dunkirk – in no small part thanks to the Defiants – was achieved. The rescued men could continue to fight for freedom and the RAF was drilled for the Battle of Britain, which would commence two months later. It was then the Defiants came undone, with embarrassing and fatal defeats. Without proper partnerships with the Hurricane and Spitfire, the Defiant couldn’t operate at its best.

Charlotte Heckermann bought her sister Ami Heckermann a scented wax melting pot for her room, and gave her a tealight to burn to release the scent into her room last weekend. But -year-old Ami was horried to discover the tealight aposdisappearedapos after burning for four hours. She immediately texted Charlotte claiming she was aposconfusedapos and upset. In a hilarious text exchange, Ami asked her -year-old sibling aposwhere has the wax in my candle goneapos and claimed it had aposdisappearedapos. When Charlotte explained aposthataposs what happensapos when you burn a candle, Ami was annoyed that this meant she had to get a new candle and bemoaned people aposdidnapost tell [her] thisapos. Charlotte, from Manchester, said: [It] evaporates. Thataposs the aposfuelapos for the candle to burn. Ami said: So [Iaposve] gotta get a new candle. Didnapost tell me this. Cheers sonaposs crying. When Charlotte asked her why she thought she always put a new candle in, Ami admitted she thought she aposhad OCDapos and then accused her of being a aposcandle expertapos. Ami claims she had never had a candle before - and always assumed they lasted after seeing family members pull out the same candles at Christmas every year. Charlotte shared her sisteraposs antics online where it got more than , likes, shares and comments from amused pals.  Ami, who works as a nursery nurse, said: Charlotte does stuff like that all the time. The smell in my room changed. It was the wax melting, I think. It didnapost smell as strongly anymore. I went over and all the wax was gone. I messaged my sister straight away like, aposwhereaposs my candle gone apos. I was so confused. I found it funny because most of the comments are something like, aposeveryone has days like thisapos or aposI feel like this is something I would doapos. Thataposs the funniest thing. Itaposs the first time Iaposve had a candle to myself. My family have had them but I think they just blow them out. They just blow them out and pull them out again the next year.  Weaposve had the same candles for about five years. The wax just stayed in. Weaposd only get them out at Christmas but even then it would just be for a couple of hours, or weaposd have fake ones. I will definitely go out and get some more candles now. My room smelled lovely. Charlotte, who works as a salon manager, said: I thought it was common sense but clearly not. It made me laugh. Anything to take the p*** out of my sister - Iaposm only joking. I bought her a melt pot, one of these things where you put a candle in the bottom and a melt wax in the top. I bought her some melts as well that are my favourite smell. She didnapost have any candles so I gave her a candle. Thataposs when, that night, she texted me at  oaposclock in the morning and said, are you awake   I thought she was joking. I asked hershe was being serious. She said, aposyes, Iaposm being serious, whereaposs it gone apos. She likes the melts that I always buy so she wanted them, but she didnapost realise you have to get more candles.

His death has sparked huge anger, with widespread protests and calls for Chauvin and his colleagues Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng, who were all fired, to face murder charges. Witnesses have disputed the Minneapolis Police Departmentaposs claims that Mr Floyd - who was unarmed - was resisting arrest. Mr Obama, the nationaposs first black president, said: This shouldnapost be aposnormalapos in  America. It canapost be normal. If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives to its highest ideals, we can and must do better. It was fall mainly on the officials of Minnesota to ensure that the circumstances surrounding George Floydaposs death is investigated thoroughly and that justice is ultimately done. But it falls on all of us, regardless of our race or station - including the majority of men and women in law enforcement who take pride in doing their tough job the right way, every day - to work together to create a new normal in which the legacy of bigotry and unequal treatment no longer infects our institutions or our hearts. The dad-of-two also included comments about the death from friends he has spoken to about Mr Floyd before making a reference to the death of -year-old Ahmaud Arbery who was shot dead while jogging unarmed in Georgia in February and Amy Cooper, a white woman who called the police after black birdwatcher Christian Cooper asked her to put her dog on a lead in Central Park in New York this week.  Itaposs natural to wish for le to just get back to normal as a pandemic and economic crisis upend everything around us, he said. But we have to remember that for millions of Americans, being treated dferently on account of race is tragically, painfully and maddeningly normal - whether itaposs while dealing with the healthcare system, or interacting with the criminal justice system, or jogging down the street, or just watching birds in a park. Mr Obamaaposs statement was released shortly before it was announced that Chauvin has been charged with third degree murder and manslaughter. Today Minneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins said Chavin and Mr Floyd knew each other because they had both worked as bouncers at the same nightclub.  It is not yet clear what,any, action will be taken against the three other officers. New footage which emerged today appears to show three officers kneeling on Mr Floydaposs neck. US telly powerhouse Oprah Winfrey tweeted an illustration of Mr Floyd with a tribute saying he wonapost be just a hashtag. She wrote: I havenapost been able to get the image of the knee on his neck out of my head.  Itaposs there with me every morning when I rise and when I go through the ordinary duties of the day. While pouring my coffee, lacing my shoes and taking a breath, I think: He doesnapost get to do this. And now the video from the other angle showing the two other police officers pinning him down. My heart sinks even deeper. His family and friends say he was a gentle giant. His death has now shown us he has a giant soul. She ended her message, saying: #GeorgeFloyd, we speak your name. But this time, we will not let your name be just a hashtag. Your spirit is lted by the cries of all of us who call for justice in your name.  Earlier today Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called for an end to the violent protests and said he expected swt justice for the officers involved. He said he understood what was driving the protests saying he believed the community had lost faith in the police force and felt they were part of the problem.

Breaking his decades-long silence, -year-old Juan Alessi today implores the Duke of York to speak to US investigators after secretly meeting with teenage sex slave Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was loaned out the Prince. In his first-ever interview, he talks candidly about the time – of which he has sworn on oath – around  years ago that Andrew attended naked pool parties at Epstein’s Florida “House of Sin”. Juan even alleges he set up tables for the Prince to be massaged on. The account puts further pressure on the Duke, who is thought to have so far refused to co-operate with an ongoing FBI investigation into the billionaire. Epstein, , committed suicide last August while awaiting trial for underage sex trafficking while Andrew had to quit public duties over their friendship. Mr Alessi began working for the Wall Street financier in  and when his American boss was first arrested for underage abuse in May , he was interviewed atby investigators. He has been questioned by the police, FBI and victims’ lawyers about Epstein, as well as Andrew’s visits to the billionaire’s £million Palm Beach home in Florida.  Mr Alessi said: “I am an American citizen and I will do anything to help bring America justice.” He believes the Duke, , should speak to investigators, including the FBI, adding: “He should. Maybe he has something to hide. I don’t know. I don’t know what happened beyond that.” No one outside Epstein’s circle of abuse saw as much as Mr Alessi. He swore on oath in  in a civil case brought by “Jane Doe ” against Epstein and again in a sworn affidavit in  in Giuffre’s civil case for defamation against Ghislaine Maxwell that Prince Andrew was among regular guests.  He told how he set up massage tables for Andrew each day during an extended stay the Duke had in the early noughties at the paedophile’s waterfront home. In November , he gave a sworn statement to Palm Beach Police in the criminal investigation into Epstein. In it, he said the Prince “spent weeks with us” and slept in “the blue room” – the main guest bedroom. Mr Alessi added that Andrew would have “daily massages”, saying: “We set up the tables.”  He said the house was “full” of nude pictures of young women: “You would need to be blind not to see them. Pictures of young girls, objects and ornaments were all over the house.” He previously recalled seeing naked girls by the pool during Andrew’s stay – but he insisted they put clothes on before entering the house. Mr Alessi told the Mirror he remembers Andrew well but never witnessed him taking part in any of the sexual impropriety claimed by two women against the royal, which he vehemently denies. Mr Alessi said: “I met Prince Andrew twice at the house. He was a complete gentleman to me.  He was a nice guy. I never see him with girls. I never see him with Virginia. I never saw him naked or actually having the massage. “If he had a massage, like I say in my deposition, everything was upstairs behind closed doors. I never saw him kissing anybody or patting anybody. “He was the only person who ever left my we and I a tip when he left. It was  bucks. It was so nice – Epstein did not allow anybody to tip us” Mr Alessi, who has not been paid and did not ask for money for his interview, said the confidentiality agreement he signed when he quit died when his former employer did.  He opened up about his  years with Epstein and his former girlfriend Maxwell. He said the British socialite, now , made him drive as she trawled the streets of Palm Beach looking for young girls to massage Epstein. Describing the daughter of shamed media tycoon Robert Maxwell as “the devil” he said: “She absolutely knew what Epstein was doing.” In a  lawsuit Maxwell, also a pal of the Duke, was called the “highest-ranking employee” of Epstein’s alleged trafficking enterprise and is alleged in court of acting as his “madam”. One alleged victim said she showed her “the proper way” to give Epstein oral sex and Maxwell offered her a “step-by-step” lesson, court files say.  She has also been accused of taking part in alleged abuse, including group sex with Epstein and Giuffre, but she has always denied any wrongdoing. One of Mr Alessi’s tasks was to clean sex toys used by Epstein and Maxwell. “I’d find sex toys in her sink. I took it as a perversion, not an abuse,” he said. “I used to put my gloves on and pick it up and wash it. She had a bathroom. The toys would be in there. “The FBI needs to talk to Ghislaine. She knows more than anyone. Whole days she spent recruiting girls. I was driving. I wish I had known what for. I would stop at a massage parlour. She would go in, take business cards. One time she had me drive to Donald Trump ’s home Mar-A-Lago looking for girls, and that is when she found Virginia.”  He said he had to pay Virginia and other girls: “I used to go to the bank, withdraw ,. I’d pay them out of petty cash and fill out a receipt. I wish I’d known what they were really being paid for. He swore them to secrecy, threatened themthey ever told.” Mr Alessi revealed he was secretly visited by Virginia several months ago and they had a tearful reunion.He said: “She told me ‘John, they abused me the first night.’ I said ‘Virginia why didn’t you come down and yell  I would have gone that moment to the police’. She was such an innocent little girl when we first met. “She told me many things. I believe her. She was too frightened to speak at the time. As far as I know, she was having a massage. I am a father. I would have punched the s*** out of this guy.” Mr Alessi said he once “challenged” the pervert: “I said ‘Jeffrey, you have to take it easy on these girls. One of them is going to get you in trouble’. He just replied ‘they only want money’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"george floyd officer who knelt","story":"NewsGeorge Floyd and officer who knelt on his neck worked together at nightclubNow-former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, , used his knee to pin down George Floyd, , for about eight minutes during an arrest outside a corner shopShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video george-floyd-cop-worked-same-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news george-floyd-officer-who-knelt-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Both worked as security guards at the El Nuevo Rodeo club in the US city, she told a local TV news station.

As you would expect, this did not end well and the aggrieved sister let out a disgruntled wail. “They would fight for the baby bottle,” Norma, , says. “Carmen would always finish before Lupita and she would grab her bottle. So Lupita would get upset.” It was one of the girls’ first disagreements and, like any siblings, Carmen and Lupita went on to have their fair share of arguments. But it was also the beginning of the pair learning to get along with each other. They had no choice. Conjoined at birth, the sisters – now  – know their entire lives will be spent together. Carmen says: “We would argue a lot when we were little, it was the process of getting to the fact that we’re kind of stuck to each other.” Lupita adds: “She would pull my hair,” as Carmen says: “She would bite.” The girls are joined at the abdomen down to their pelvis, where their spines meet. They each have two arms, but only a single leg, with Carmen controlling the right leg and Lupita, the left. They took their first steps aged four and they learned to balance and co-ordinate although, of course, it wasn’t easy. They are omphalopagus twins, which make up % of all conjoined twins. It means each of the girls has a heart, a set of arms, a set of lungs and a stomach. But they share some ribs, a liver, their circulatory system and their digestive and reproductive systems. When Lupita and Carmen were young, doctors considered separating them, but concluded it couldn’t be done safely because they shared too many vital organs and their lower spine. Carmen says: “We’re never going to get separated. We’re never going to be inidual people. We’ve been dealt a weird hand but we have to deal with it.” The sisters feature in an upcoming Channel Four documentary Two Sisters, One Body. And while the girls are conjoined physically, they are very distinctly separate people. Carmen admits she is the most talkative but Lupita says she is the funnier one. The pair, and mum Norma, are talking on a Zoom call from their Connecticut home of New Milford, a town of about ,. Carmen said: “We like it. It’s a really small town, but it’s really nice. The people are nice. We have a lot of friends here.”  Norma and their dad Victor brought them to the States from Veracruz in Mexico, in search of better medical treatment when they were babies. Carmen says: “My mom was told lots of conjoined twins don’t live past three days.” And Lupita adds: “The doctor said to my dad – pick one or they’re both going to die. We would have both dieda charity hadn’t brought us to the US.” The family moved when the girls were two years old and, once in America, doctors said they would never be separated, and any attempt would see them die on the operating table or spend their lives in intensive care. So the family, including older sister Abby, now , settled down to what would become their new normal. Of course, there were struggles and they faced prejudice and ignorance. Norma recalls: “When they were little, I took them to the mall. I put Carmen and Lupita into one of the mall buggies and a lady was mad because I was ‘too cheap’ and forced two babies into the pram.” But despite everything, they were still just two little girls doing what little girls do. “They would do handstands all the time” Norma remembers. “We never really talked about them being dferent. They learned how they were dferent on their own and were fine.” The girls have faced dficult questions their whole lives. Carmen rolls her eyes, recalling: “When we were nine or , we were once asked how sex would work  “So you’re in the middle of a public place and they were like, ‘how would that work ’ And I was like, ‘I’m nine.’” It’s not just inappropriate questions, says Carmen, there are inappropriate comments as well. She says: “There’ll be grown adults that will be like, ‘Oh, you guys look like aliens.”’ Lupita agrees: “Or sometimes someone’s, like, ‘Does your mom look like you ’ And she’s right next to me.” Surely this must have been enormously upsetting for them  Lupita says: “It depends on the day, but we deal with it with comedic responses. Likesomeone asks uswe’re twins or sisters, we usually respond with something like ‘nah, we’re just really close cousins’.” “Being conjoined is not all we think about. We’re also two Mexican twins trying to get along in Trump’s America – sometimes that’s as big a deal as being stuck to your sister.” The Trump government recently tried to remove the programme that allows the family – and other immigrant families – to stay in the US. The deferred action programme means immigrant families can staytheir children are having medical treatment. Currently, they have to renew their right to remain every year. They finished high school, Carmen learned to drive and at the second attempt. Lupita says: “My dad wouldn’t let me drive after I almost crashed into something.” And Carmen explains: “I have the right leg and I’m a little bit taller than her. We tried letting her hold the steering wheel once. It didn’t really work.” Lupita adds: “I put the turn signals on. That’s pretty much it.” The two have loved animals since they were little and see their future as running an agriculture business. After going to an agricultural high school, they’re now at college two days a week and hope to study in the veterinary field. “We’ve both been interested in animals since we were five” says Lupita. “But because of certain physical issues we’re going into vet tech and then hopefully we’ll go on and get a bachelors in animals science.” High school was a good time for the girls and they made close friends. And one teacher in particular, Mr Davenport, made the whole thing go smoothly. The twins are seen saying a tearful farewell to him in the new documentary. Carmen says: “There have been obstacles physically. But he never said anything or made us feel like there’s anything we couldn’t do.” For now, lockdown goes on. The girls hope it will be over in time for their th birthday in a couple of weeks. They want a party, to go out to the park, hang out with their friends or go out on a boat with their dad. They’ve passed the time watching Tiger King and listening to s music. Destiny’s Child is a favourite.

Chinese CDC had previously said the first cases of the virus emerged at the market at The Huanan Seafood Market where rats, snakes are openly and illegally on sale. But the exact location of where Covid- started remains a mystery as the Chinese CDC said samples of animals in the market tested negative for the virus. On Thursday Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese CDC, told Chinese state media: It now turns out that the market is one of the victims. As the animals in the market tested negative it means they couldnapost have infected traders or shoppers. Colin Carlson, a zoologist at Georgetown University told Live Science said this means the market was likely to have been the location where one sick person there became a apossuper spreaderapos. He said it could take years to find out how the virus jumped from animals to humans, where it spread and its exact origin. This is an animal-origin virus that made the leap, maybe from bats to humans, maybe through… another animal, maybe through livestock. And we donapost have the data yet to know where or how. he said.  That takes time. The study that really definitively showed the bats that SARS came from was published in ,apos -  years after SARS first broke out. It took that long to go through caves, to go through samples, and build an evidence base where we could confidently say: aposThis was the sort of bat, in this cave, at this time. Conflicting information about the origins of coronavirus has led to claims of cover up which has disputed by researchers in and out of China. This new revelation may fuel speculation that the virus was leaked from a Chinese research laboratory.  Earlier this month US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said there was growing proof the pandemic began in a Chinese lab. But researchers in the US and China say there is no evidence to support this theory. A majority of the original  cases of coronavirus reported to the World Health Organisation in December were linked to the -acre market. The virus is believed to have been active in Wuhan before the cases were reported to WHO.  Stomach-churning picture emerged of food market in China which showed animals illegally for sale inside the building that had dirt-encrusted floors and walls splattered with blood. Wild, exotic and farmed animals were packed together and described as a breeding ground for the disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve and make the jump to humans. The market was closed in January and according to reports the majority of its , shops had reopened by April . According to the Chinese CDC study  of the original cases showed no link to the wet market.  Research from January showed the first person confirmed to have contracted coronavirus was likely exposed as early as December  before showing symptoms on December . The apospatient zeroapos has not been confirmed but authorities believe it may have been a -year-old man from Hubei province who was infected on November . If so it means the virus was around Wuhan for weeks before the apossuper spreader eventapos at the market. Wang Yanyi, director of the Wuhan virus lab, said Covid- is genetically dferent from any live virus they ever studied in the institute. Other studies compared the genome of the virus with genetic information on other bat coronaviruses held at the lab but there was no match. The news comes as a virologist referred to as aposBat Womanapos has warned about a new SARS-like pandemic caused by bats and viruses being involved in an aposevolutionary arms raceapos.Shi Zhengli is one of the worldaposs authorities on coronavirus."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/Key-Dates-FB-820-x-312px.jpg ","title":"back in business heres everything you need to know about scotlands first virtual agricultural show","story":"Bring out the bunting – Scotland’s summer show season is back in business!There’s only one place to be on July  and , and that’s in the action-packed showground of the online Scottish Agricultural Show.After months of mourning the lack of social gatherings, fierce competition in the livestock rings, shiny machinery displays and tempting arrays of food and drink, The Press and Journal and The Courier have partnered with the Royal Highland Show to create a virtual event that will encompass all the essential elements for a great couple of days out.And unlike normal summer shows you won’t need your wellies “just in case” as the sun is guaranteed to shine all day!To bring the showground to le we’re calling on cattle, sheep, horse, goat and poultry producers to video their top stock which will be judged online by some of the country’s most respected livestock breeders. There will be classes for the main breeds, young handlers will have their own sections, and all the videos will be posted on the show website for everyone to view.There are full instructions on how to take part at www.scottishagriculturalshow so get involved, start halter training that heer or walking your goat. You’ve got until midnight on June  to enter and stand a chance of winning ’s only show in town.We’ll have a beer tent where you can meet up with folk, and while you might not be able to touch all the new tractors and combines, the country’s main dealers and businesses will have trade stands to pore over while you wait for the judging to be completed. We’re not forgetting farming heritage either, which will be represented with a class for vintage machinery.The food and drink tent will act as a shop window for all our top-class agricultural produce, and chefs will give cookery demonstrations and offer tips on how to make the most of Scotland’s delicious larder.And once you’re inspired to start baking you’ll find all the details of how to enter the cake competition on the website.DC Thomson is throwing all its weight behind organising Scotland’s first virtual agricultural show, a move which the company’s head of newspapers, Richard Neville, said was in response to a desire from readers and advertisers for a way of maintaining some sort of show presence this summer.“We hope that all exhibitors and entrants enjoy the experience and hopefully it will show that there can be a digital alternative to even the oldest and most traditional events in our packed agri-business calendar,” he said.Getting the mighty Royal Highland Show’s unqualied support has been a huge boost, and one of the show directors, farmer Kay Adam from Angus, gave the online event her enthusiastic backing.“Excellent judges have been lined up to take part and I hope many of the breeders who had hoped to parade in the shows this summer will feature on the small screen in this show,” she said.Our main sponsor is EQ Accountants, one of the leading providers of accountancy, tax and business advice to Scotland’s agricultural industry. Also on board so far are Rural Scotland , ANM Group , Samaritans , Netherton Tractors , Angus Timber Cabins , Mackays Dundee , Red Poppy , Bon Accord Soft Drinks , Balgownie , Stewart’s Resort , Gin Bothyand  Brewing .EQ partner Graeme Davidson emphasised how much the agricultural community would miss the traditional show season this summer.He added: “We enjoy welcoming clients and friends to our stands at the Fe, Angus and Turrf Shows. We’ll miss that this year but hope that the virtual show provides a way of supporting those communities in an interesting and innovative way.”The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"coronavirus live flexible furlough scheme to be introduced at the beginning of july","story":"Keep up with the latest updates as the coronavirus pandemic continues throughout Scotland and the UK.Reporters from across the DCT Media titles will keep you up to date with the latest closures, cancellations, health information and more.We’ll bring you all of the news as it happens throughout the day:The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53736376-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran schism spfl","story":"IT feels very much like there’s a schism opening up in Scottish football over when to get back to action – the cans and the cannots.Various start points have been suggested – July, August, October, January and beyond.What is becoming increasingly clear, though, is there are clubs who can’t afford to play in front of empty stands without financial aid from where.But there are also clubs who can’t afford not to be playing as soon as safely possible, empty stands or not.In each of the bottom three leagues, there are teams on either side of this ide.And it’s a ide which could have serious lasting effects on the long-term future of the SPFL.The Premiership clubs have already stated they’ll be looking to start training again next month and a start date in August seems to be the target.Of course, without a vaccine, it very much looks like there will be no punters there to cheer their teams on from the stands.Sky Sports, though, want something to put on the air and, with a chunky new deal to kick off, the top flight can’t afford to consider any kind of mothballing, despite the immense costs to continually test personnel for Covid-.For Dundee United, that means they’ll kick off their long-awaitedto the top table quietly.It’s not ideal but I’m sureyou offered Arabs the deal that their team would be back in the Premiership but they wouldn’t be there to see it, they’d take it.As has been said often, these are unprecedented times and compromises have to be made.Across the road, though, things are much more uncertain.Dundee want to get back playing, behind closed doors or not.The Dark Blues are in a relatively stable place financially right now but they’ll be back to paying a full squad’s wages in October when the furlough scheme ends –there’s no football by that point, they’ll be paying big wages for no work.However, other Championship clubs are clearly in a dferent position – my club Queen of the South have said it would be financial suicide to play behind closed doors for them – and they aren’t the only ones.It doesn’t seem like there can be a compromise between these two stances. What happens then Will we see the ‘cans’ come together to form their own league temporarily and leave the ‘cannots’ to their mothballs We’ve all railed at the self-interest that has forever governed the SPFL – this all seems a more reasonable discussion but one that could, evenonly temporarily, see some clubs leave others behind in the dust.GORDON Strachan fairly rattled a few cages with his views at the start of the week.The Dundee technical director takes exception to some clubs in the lower leagues surviving for survival’s sake.From a man who has played and managed at the highest level, he’s certainly one whose views should be taken into account.He called for more professionalism throughout the leagues and to get away from the part-time mentality.I agree.But there is also an assumption there that being part-time is somehow a choice for clubs in the lower isions.These teams have to scrap for every penny so they can try to be competitive on the pitch. Cash isn’t exactly flowing, even in the Championship.On the former Scotland manager’s opinion that we don’t sell our game nearly as well as we should, I wholeheartedly agree.We hold ourselves back as a group by thinking only about ourselves – change that and the money will filter down the leagues and, hopefully, bring more professionalism.CLUBS across the country are releasing their players.It’s normal for the profession at this time of year but this time is dferent – players now can’t find new employment.Dundee, as well as Falkirk and Ayr, should be applauded for resisting the urge to cut costs by granting the players at least a few weeks more pay.When you see a club like Dunfermline release  players, it puts it into perspective.I don’t think  will be the highest number we see either.I was disappointed to hear my team Queen of the South release almost their entire squad.Pretty much only Stephen Dobbie and Kevin Holt remain.It’s a business decision but there is also a human aspect of looking after your staff.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

Wersquove been erted from the highest moral purpose ndash keeping our minds fixed on the loss of fellow human beings and the government decisions which were involved in their deaths ndash to casting our eyes into a gutter of deceit, hypocrisy and selfishness.This is not to say, however, that the media should have held back on coverage of Cummings ndash completely the reverse. Without the forensic scrutiny of journalists wersquod never know about the double standards to which the rich and powerful hold themselves and us. We can now see that the Cummings scandal isnrsquot just a moral affront, itrsquos potentially lethal too. How many people have shrugged their shoulders and said to hell with public health advice in the wake of Cummingsrsquo actions, adopting a lsquo he can do it, so can Irsquo attitude :Sandy Kennedy: To have impact, we must move to action immediatelyHowever, under the cover of such an appalling spectacle many political issues have become distorted at a time when we need clarity of vision and nowhere has that distortion played out more than in Scotland. Cummings has had a unique Caledonian Effect.Letrsquos be frank, the squalid behaviour of Cummings and Johnson has thrown a protective cloak around the the SNP government when it comes to failures over coronavirus. Cummings has unwittingly played something of a blinder for the party and its ambitions for independence.Until the Cummings scandal, most decent minds were concentrated on the SNP governmentrsquos dreadful handling of care home deaths. More than  elderly hospital patients were sent to homes prior to mandatory testing. Around half of Scotlandrsquos deaths have been in care homes.Amid the Cummings scandal, Nicola Sturgeon said she found the care home deaths ldquoheartbreaking. Shersquos a woman of decency so her emotional response is to be believed. That doesnrsquot excuse her Governmentrsquos failures, however. Yet with Cummings soaking up headlines, scrutiny of the issue shrunk. Pressure on health secretary Jeane Freeman over her mistakes weakened.We cannot simply accept such failings in Holyrood because therersquos a tawdry circus of shame in Westminster that draws attention away. You didnrsquot need a science degree to know that the elderly were most at risk. However, there was no mandatory testing for all new care home residents in Scotland until April .The Cummings scandal has overshadowed claims that the transfer of elderly patients from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow to Gartnavel led to the virus spreading like it was onboard a ldquocruise ship. Gartnavel is said to have recorded  cases and  deaths in a matter of weeks. The buck for this stops at the desk of the health secretary and the First Minister.Concerns about a possible cover-up by the Scottish Government over an early outbreak of coronavirus in Edinburgh have been eclipsed by the Cummings scandal. Lockdown came too late here ndash just as it did in England. Testing and tracing have been inadequate. Itrsquos been a catalogue of one failure after another.From the pandemicrsquos early days, there wasnrsquot that much of a substantive dference in policy between Holyrood and Westminster. Increasingly, though, Sturgeon has begun to forge Scotlandrsquos own path but itrsquos still far from successful. We arenrsquot New Zealand, thatrsquos for sure.Set against the Johnson government, anything would look good. Some % of Scots think Sturgeon has handled the crisis well. However, comparing pretty bad to bloody useless shouldnrsquot be the yardstick by which we measure what our governments do for us.:Jedbergh jousting team challenge to film behind closed doorsThe SNP are frankly lucky to have this shameless and idiotic government in London in the shape of Cummings and Johnson. But that, sadly, makes the Scottish people less lucky. The failings in Scotland arenrsquot any less meaningful just because Boris Johnson is a disaster. If Westminster was being run by a competent leader, the SNPrsquos behaviour would seem signicantly more concerning.The Cummings Effect is also shaping other parties. Some Scottish Tories finally distanced themselves from the UK leadership, with calls for Cummings to go. It simply adds to the notion that the Scottish Tories should strike out alone and leave the UK fold. It also reinforces the perception that the partyrsquos voice here is relatively meaningless.What have Scottish Labour or the Scottish LibDems done that matters throughout the Cummings scandal  Nothing. Whatrsquos the point of Scottish Labour  When it comes to Labour the only story in town is Keir Starmer ndash the great hope. Nice guy as he may be, Richard Leonard doesnrsquot cut through ndash even at a time like this, with Cummings, when a butter kne could cut throughit had the will. The Greens also need to find their voice.When it comes to independence, Cummings must have an effect on floating voters, and soft No voters. Irsquom a Yes voter, and Irsquove been increasingly disheartened in the direction of travel the independence movement has taken in recent years. The SNP base is beyond ugly, the idea of independence has intellectually stagnated, and independence itself has provided the SNP with a shield to hide bad governance behind as its voters will tolerate any failing as long as talk of independence is thrown out now and again as red meat.But even jaded Yes voters like me feel a little galvanised now by the Cummings scandal. I may be uneasy with the independence package currently on offer ndash too many unanswered questions, and the whf of populism, Scottish exceptionalism and thin-skinned nationalism ndash but compared to where Westminster is going, I know which option looks more appealing. Westminster has been a corrupt failure for generations, now itrsquos a sick, cruel joke played on the British people.This pandemic hasnrsquot been handled well or adequately by Scotland and its government. Nevertheless, even a dysal Scotland is better than whatever the hell is happening in Westminster.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It peaked at number seven in the charts she would follow it with a number one hit, To Sir With Love , the soulful Oh Me Oh My , and the  Bowie collaboration, The Man Who Sold the World and, that same year, the Bond theme song, The Man with the Golden Gun. She has had hits in five consecutive decades, both as a solo act and in association with everyone from Elton John to Take That, Ronan Keating, Sting and Bobby Womack.ALEX HARVEYLONG before he teamed with a Glasgow band, Tear Gas, to form the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, Harvey was one of the most singular characters on the Scottish scene in the s. ldquoIrsquod never heard a guitar played the way Alex did ndash he was hitting it ndash and he shouted more than he sang, Bill Patrick, who played alongside Harvey in an early group, is quoted in Brian Hoggrsquos The History of Scottish Rock and Pop. ldquoThe result was very, very exciting. He tried to play in a country style while I preferred jazz, and while knocking the numbers about came up with, I suppose, Scottish rockrsquonrsquoroll.In  Harvey won a newspaper competition to find Scotlandrsquos answer to Tommy Steele: his charisma and musical talents put him miles ahead of the  other hopefuls. A sequence of bands ensued, culminating in the Alex Harvey Soul Band, who were dynamite on stage and released an album in . Harvey died in February .JOHN MARTYNThis innovative, much-loved guitarist and songwriter was born in Surrey but he was brought to Glasgow at a young age by his father. At school, he proved to be academically gted - his boyhood interests included ornithology and the work of the French Impressionists ndash and though Glasgow could be rough , it would prove pivotal in his musical development: it was in Glasgow that he picked up his first guitar and learned how to play it. Hamish Imlach was a considerable influence on the young Martynrsquos guitar abilities. Martyn graduated to some of the local folk clubs. At , London beckoned: and in October  he released his debut album, London Conversation. A second album, The Tumbler, followed  months later. It was the birth of a remarkable career full of outstanding achievements. Martyn died, aged , in January .-- CLOUDSTHE story of progressive rock in this country owes much to this adventurous Scottish trio ndash Ian Ellis , Billy Ritchieand Harry Hughes . Initially known as --, they supported Jimi Hendrix at two London gigs in May . David Bowie was an early fan and hung around with them. ldquoWersquod just been signed by Brian Epstein and David thought we were the next big thing, as did we, Ritchie recalled in . Re-named Clouds in , they signed to a major label and released three albums. They were years ahead of their time but, despite their musical gts and favourable reviews, Clouds didnrsquot get the success they deserved. They did, however, influence several key prog-rock bands. ldquoWe simply werenrsquot showmen and distrusted those who were. But Irsquod have to concede that all those other bands took something clever and non-commercial ndash us ndash and made it more popular and successful, Ritchie said.THE INCREDIBLE STRING BANDTHIS ground-breaking and hugely influential group emerged from the Scottish folk scene. Robin Williamson, Clive Palmer and Mike Heron released a debut album in  music we wanted to listen to, Heron would later say, but then Williamson and Palmer went abroad. Multi-instrumentalists Heron and Palmer reformed the ISB as a duo and made a series of visionary albums, including The  Spirits or The Layers of the Onion, and The Hangmanrsquos Beautul Daughter. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie and Paul McCartney were all admirers. As author Rob Young observes in his book, Electric Eden, the duo had by the decadersquos end become a cult hit with fans and critics, one broadsheet writer going so far as to say that they now rivalled the Beatles in being ldquothe most important influence in songwriting. Their distinctive music, influenced by music from across the world, is today as arresting as it ever was. Listen to Chinese White, the opening track on The  Spirits.DONOVANInspired by Greta Thunberg, Donovan, , last month released Eco-Song, an album of songs with an eco theme.Itrsquos a startling thought that his career began in his teens. By the time he released his masterwork album, Sunshine Superman, in , he was only  he had already had four top  singles and had won an Ivor Novello award for his very first song, the timeless Catch The Wind.The Sunshine Superman album is said to have ushered in the psychedelic era, while the title song itself is one of the signature hits of the Summer of Love.Donovan influenced, and was a great friend of, the Beatles and among his other achievements he was writing about climate change when the subject was decidedly unfashionable.THE POETSIN late  this Glasgow beat combo peaked at number  in the British charts with Now Wersquore Thru. The group had impressed the Rolling Stones manager, Andrew Loog Oldham , and they found themselves part of Jagger  corsquos circle. The song, which can be heard on YouTube, is replete with -string guitars and tambourines, and was ahead of its time. ldquoThere had been nothing like it in pop before, says Brian Hogg in his History of Scottish Rock and Pop. Subsequent Poets singles maintained the bandrsquos original style of making music.THE BEATSTALKERSThere are those who take the view that this Glasgow sixties beat group are the story of Scottish music. Occasionally billed as the lsquoScottish Beatlesrsquo, they were an exciting live act, blessed with strong songs. They famously caused a riot with a free, open-air lunchtime concert in Glasgowrsquos George Square in June,  . Their song, You Better Get a Better Hold On, shows what they were capable of. The band recorded songs with David Bowie and shared stages with such acts as Marc Bolan and the Kinks.MARMALADEINITIALLY known as Dean Ford and the Gaylords, then the Gaylords, Marmalade were a key act of the era. Their early songs -Itrsquos All Leading up to Saturday Night,Canrsquot Stop Now,I See the Rain- got them noticed. With the singles, Cant Stop Now There Aint No Use in Hanging On, and I See the Rain, the band \"captured the experimental aura of s flower-power summer\", says Brian Hogg in the History of Scottish Rock and Pop. \"These records may not have been the freak-rock of a Soft Machine or Family, but they were exemplary, exploratory pop and have remained as fresh, light and inspired as they were whe first recorded\". Marmalade went on to have a Number One hit with a cover of the Beatles Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da in , and a top  hit with Reflections of My Le, \"a more serious work which ably reflected their underused compositional skills\" . Subsequent hits included Cousin Norman, Radancer and Falling Apart at the Seams.OrsquoHARArsquoS PLAYBOYSTHIS Glasgow group was formed in  around John OrsquoHara, and for a time attracted critical praise.

On March  he was at an England-Wales rugby match, cited by Cheltenham Festival organisers as a reason their event would go ahead.An utterly cavalier ldquoherd immunity strategy without vaccines or treatments available was outlined by Sir Patrick in his March  press conference with Mr Johnson.Nor had the Government prepared in advance, despite advice from experts in  and  to stockpile PPE and decades of experts warning another respiratory virus pandemic was only a matter of ldquoWhen  And from where .Almost six months after the first cases, with lockdown already eased, therersquos still no effective contact tracing app, and there still arenrsquot enough people tested.

The whole Government and the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesshould resign.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.WHY doesnt the PM just give those in the slavering press and the sanctimonious brigade who are so sure of their purity that they would \"cast the first stone \" what they crave and get Dominic Cummings to resign.The PM could then rehire him as a personal advisor and have his salary paid by a supporter ,thus keeping him a trusted sounding board whom he obviously rates so highly ... he did after all mastermind the Leave vote and an -plus majority at the last election.This would result in this pathetic, overhyped circus ending with both parties thinking they had won. Then the Government could get on and deal with the very serious problem that is Covid- in terms of mitigating the horrendous pain and loss to so many of our number and dealing with the economic Armageddon coming over the horizon.Get it done.James Martin, Bearsden.HAVING listened to Dominic Cummings give an account of his actions as we were led down the Downing Street garden path, and having read the letters and articles in The Herald over recent days both for and against Mr Cummings, it seems to me that the fact that Mr Cummings was able to drive  miles from London to Durham without stopping, and with his sick we and young son on board, was more good luck than good judgment. In addition, the fact that he drove to and from Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, which had been giving him problems, again accompanied by his we and child, and drove the  miles back to London, without any mishap occurring, was also more good luck than good judgment.Given that Mr Cummings would appear to trust more to luck than judgment, is he really the kind of man who should be in charge of running the country Ruth Marr, Stirling.WHILST the First Minister has accepted that mistakes have likely been made and ndash when this is over ndash it will be necessary to undertake a review on all aspects of its handling, I have yet to see such contrition or indeed any such constructive comment from the Prime Minister.What is simply not acceptable, as he is currently attempting with his Dominic Cummings dficulty, is to \"move on\" to address other issues in which he is interested ndash EU withdrawal and more.As a member of the public, I am certainly not content with applauding the heroics of the NHS staff and yet see them being deprived of the tools to do their job.This has been an early warning of what might come at a later date. We need ndash no, we demand, that future investment in the NHS will enable its staff, without placing their lives at risk, to safely do their job.Alan McKinney, EH.ACROSS Europe, and beyond, Covid- has been a devastating tragedy for care homes. Wherever the coronavirus has achieved signicant infection rates, grim death rates in care homes have followed, often accounting for  per cent or more of total deaths. On cursory examination England currently appears to be exhibiting a lower rate but when \"excess deaths\" are fully accounted the rate there will not only likely be comparable, as indicated by the recent LSE study, but the overall death rate per head of population looks like it may be the highest in Europe, and possibly the highest in the world, through this first phase of the pandemic.Jackson Carlaw and Richard Leonard have now both decided to point their political fingers at the Scottish Government for embarking on a UK-wide approach of accelerated early discharge from hospitals, especially of the elderly, at a time when hospitals were expected to be overwhelmed with Covid- patients . Following the advice of clinicians some were discharged into care homes subject to Government regulations and guidelines. Certainly at the time none of these politicians was disputing this logical action, but perhaps everyone has been naiumlve about the day-to-day ing of care homes, especially those governed by the aims of private investors. Staff moving in and out of care homes, many of which were not properly prepared for a pandemic and initially not fully supported by their management in the purchase of appropriate PPE, may have been the primary carriers of Covid- into these homes.How many were are in the unenviable position of effectively working under zero-hours-contracts with little or no income should they suspect they may have the virus and feel compelled to work on, especially in situations where residents in their care are already suffering because of reduced staffing numbers and the torture, for some, of isolation Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.I AM in complete agreement with David Stubley .

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We remain committed to supporting the work of the management group to co-ordinate a range of goose management measures as soon as feasibly possible.”Alan Corrigall, Orkney NFU Scotland chairman said: “We are disappointed that the momentum which had been gathering to find new ways to control the resident geese population has come to a halt.  However, hopefully marksmen shooting later this summer can still go ahead as planned, and the other agreed control measures can be trialled next year.”Land managers can still control greylag geese under the General Licence to prevent agricultural damage, provided they can comply with the Government’s COVID- restriction rules. The General Licence was amended this year so inidual licences to carry out shooting or egg oiling during closed season are no longer required.Greylag goose meat sales have also been consented under a General Licence for Orkney. As a result, land managers on Orkney can now, under food hygiene legislation, sell the greylag goose carcasses they generate,they are satisfied they comply with the COVID- suppression rules. Land managers must ensure work carried out follows the General Licence rules.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The armed forces have been helping out across the UK building emergency hospitals, delivering vital supplies and much more. UK government staff based all across the world have also been helping UK citizens to get home to the UK during the global Coronavirus outbreak. Today we look at how members of Government departments have been helping solve some of the problems created by the Coronavirus outbreak.On March , the Defence Secretary announced a COVID Support Force to assist public services with their response to the coronavirus outbreak. There were , Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness to assist civil authorities, of which nearly , have already been deployed.Military reservists have also been mobilised as part of the COVID Support Force and used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction.The help from the UK’s armed forces during the Coronavirus outbreak has taken a number of dferent forms. The Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK, which has seen them working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services.The UK Armed Forces’ efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to regional testing centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment. Military personnel are also currently working to distribute PPE to NHS trusts and organisations across the country.Up to May , Armed Forces personnel had helped to deliver over . billion items of PPE to NHS staff in England. Six military specialists have also been deployed to assist NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP face masks.A new COVID Aviation Task Force has been established. This includes two RAF Puma based in Kinloss Barracks to help the NHS in Scotland and Northern England.Support has included training key workers in ious locations around the Western Hebrides in medical evacuation procedures and supporting NHS staff, plus helping with five medical evacuations in England and Scotland.More than , British travellers have ed to the UK on  special Government charter flights from  dferent countries and territories since the outbreak of coronavirus.Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff have been working around the clock with the airline industry and host governments across the world to help bring back British travellers.Up to £ million has been made available for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable travellers.So far, charter flights have ed British nationals to the UK from countries ranging from Bolivia to Bermuda and New Zealand to Nepal., passengers who have ed from Spain.Around  British nationals have ed from Kenya on five commercial flights, which would not have been possible without the work of our High Commission in Nairobi.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also helped more than , British passengers who were aboard  cruise ships disembark.A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting toto the UK has also been put in place.The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options.The Department for International Developmentleads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty.The UK is an international development superpower, and we are also a scientic and medical world leader. UK-based scientists, such as those at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are playing key roles in the global response to this deadly new virus.Through the DFID aid budget, the UK is the largest single national contributor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations international efforts to find a vaccine. Through this fund, we are working to improve our understanding of the virus and to support scientists around the globe – CEPI is already backing nine potential vaccines.Once a vaccine is found, delivering it globally will be the next big challenge. To help that, the Government has invested the equivalent of £ million a year for the next five years in Gavi, the global vaccine alliance that delivers vaccines in  of the poorest countries around the world.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the inability to spend time with family and friends to the impact on businesses, the effect has been profound and far-reaching.  Thanks to those efforts, however, we have seen a downward trend in new cases of infection that has enabled the Scottish Government to begin easing restrictions.“Despite this initial relaxation of the rules, however, I was pleased to hear the First Minister reiterate that travelling to the islands, other than in exceptional circumstances, is still not possible for now.  It is a dficult message, but absolutely the right one at this time.“We know that many people across the UK, and further afield, look forward to visiting Orkney at this time of year.  However, the safety of our community remains paramount and there is still some way to go before we can begin welcoming visitors again.“The First Minister’s message though is a reminder of the signicant economic impact that the shutdown of the tourism sector has on Orkney.  The grant support provided by the UK and Scottish governments to mitigate this impact has been welcome, but too many local businesses still find they are falling between the cracks.“I will continue to work with Ministers to ensure that gaps in support are closed.  Meantime, I would urge the public to keep following the advice of the government and hopefully it won’t be long before we can look forward to visitors ing to Orkney”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We ask those who are local to beaches to continue to be aware of the inherent dangers and to avoid taking risks. Our strong advice to the Scottish public, who are not local to a beach, is to exercise locally and not to travel to the coast.#Scotland’s air temperature may be warming up but the sea temperature remains consistently chilly all year, jumping or falling into cold water or spending longer periods than normal submerged in the water can lead to, potentially fatal, cold water shock.”Michael Avril, Scotland’s water safety lead for the RNLI and chair of Water Safety Scotland said: “The Scottish public need to remember the following safety advice: Stay in familiar surroundings,follow Scottish Government advice of remaining within five miles of your home, don’t put yourself, your family and emergency services at risk by taking risks or assuming it ‘won’t happen to you’. If you do see someone at risk call  and ask for the Coastguard.”The message from the RNLI in Scotland is clear, an easing of lockdown does not mean an instantly safer coast and water temperatures remain dangerously cold.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!!

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

There was always something going on like bingo, quizzes, visits from school children and church services.“Now all of that has stopped because of the virus, and visits are restricted to talking through the window.“It’s been a great thing to see her at the piano.”Charles Delaney, manager of McClymont House, said Mrs Parker’s piano playing was a “great news story” at a time when many care homes are in the spotlight for much more sombre reasons.“She is a remarkable, inspiring woman who offers hope,” he added. “She is showing that older people in care homes still have le in them, and they can still make a contribution for their families and for the wider community as well.”Money raised by Mrs Parker will be given to the Lanarkshire Health Board Endowment Fund which invests donations to improve patient’s health.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus.

Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

The minister acknowledged that as frustrating lockdown has been for many, progress will be gradual and in stages.It comes as messaging around lockdown from the Executive is now focused on stay safe, save lives and work safe, save lives. Mrs Dodds acknowledged the frustration felt by those in the hospitality sector, after hoteliers raised concerns following Thursday#s press conference in which they were told they could accept advance bookings without a reopening date from the Executive.

While I welcome the extension of the self-employment scheme, the tapering of the job retention scheme from August is premature. I am concerned it could lead to redundancies, particularly in the hardest hit industries such as hospitality, retail and leisure.I will be raising these issues with Treasury and stressing the need to protect jobs and livelihoods.Economy Minister Diane Dodds also voiced fears over forthcoming changes to the furlough scheme.This would be incredibly dficult for some employers, particularly those in hospitality and retail sectors which have been closed for three months. It is uncertain whether they will get back to full operations for a number of months yet to come, she said.Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said closing application to the scheme in June was too early.The furlough scheme has helped companies here preserve thousands of jobs through lockdown... but many firms still face signicant uncertainty ahead, she said. On that basis, closing the scheme to new applicants in June feels premature, and risks undermining some of the work already done to preserve businesses and jobs.Whilst today#s announcement is welcome, the Chancellor must also be open to additional and new support for those sectors that will stay closed the longest over the coming months.Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts also expressed concerns over the Chancellor#s plans.It is clear that the furlough scheme is being gradually phased out with more costs for employers from August, he said.Whilst this is not unexpected, it does signicantly raise challenges for retailers in Northern Ireland who still do not have a date to reopen. The NI Executive#s recovery plan does not provide signicant sections of our retail sector with reopening dates. Many of these businesses currently have no income and will be concerned that by August they may be liable for ER NICand pension contributions.Retail NI wants to see a reopening timetable in June based upon medical evidence for the retail sector as a whole to avoid this problem.Director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Aodhan Connolly said: A tapered end to the furlough scheme means that there will not be another huge shock to an industry which has suffered so much over recent weeks.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirus PremiumHow Northern Ireland hotels will look after lockdownSay bye bye to breakfast buffets, ciao to the concierge and hello to a  hour supply of hand sanitizer.Northern IrelandCo Down Catholic grammars suspend selection for a yearFive Catholic grammar schools have announced they will not use academic selection for their  intake.Most ReadDUP MP Paisley #oops# moment as he sends email to hundreds joking about NI ExecutiveHow three NI people transformed their gardens in coronavirus lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Each month in lockdown #akin to a large recession#, says Economy Minister Diane DoddsPolice issue warning to parents as sunny weather brings crowds outAs NI#s lockdown eases where are people most at risk of picking up Covid- ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a flicker, a flame of perseverance. It might look small, but it is giant at heart, fuelled by our spirit that never wavers, whatever comes our way.“We are a land that, in times of need, stands together, stands strong and will not falter.”He adds: “Ours is a giant spirit forged by our surroundings. A spirit filled with relentless creativity descended from legends that shines through cold winds with warm smiles and open hearts.“We’ll get through this, just like everything . We’ll keep fighting on the front lines, we’ll keep protecting our families, our loved ones, our community.“We’ll keep our spirits up and raise the spirits of those around us. We will get through this, together.”The film which is just under two minutes long, also includes a clip of Pastor Mark McClurg, of Newtownards Elim Church, who made headlines when he spoke of his near-death experience in viral videos recorded from the coronavirus ward of the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.Tourism NI Chief Executive John McGrillen said the video tribute “showcases the generosity, spirit and strength of our people and conveys the fact that in times of need we stand together”.“The people of Northern Ireland and the warm hearted courtesy that we extend to others is the essence of our welcome and so we decided that as an agency we were well placed to pay tribute to everyone who has stood together during this crisis.”He added: “We are acutely aware of the challenges faced by our communities as we start to consider how we move into recovery. “The tourism industry will have an important role in helping to rebuild the economy, sustain jobs and create opportunities for our young people.“We have witnessed incredible strength from our entire community in recent months and this film is intended, as much as a thank you, as a way of stating that we will continue to need each other to rebuild in the years ahead.“Tourism NI, Government and industry are working together in unique ways to provide practical help to businesses in Northern Ireland. Despite the considerable challenges that we face this film is one of hope and pride shared across the country.”Belfast Most ReadDUP MP Paisley #oops# moment as he sends email to hundreds joking about NI ExecutiveHow three NI people transformed their gardens in coronavirus lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Each month in lockdown #akin to a large recession#, says Economy Minister Diane DoddsPolice issue warning to parents as sunny weather brings crowds outAs NI#s lockdown eases where are people most at risk of picking up Covid- ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s a move that places trust with communities, teachers and parents, he said.This crisis means that many children have not had access to a level learning playing field.That#s fine for those who can afford private tuition for their children, but those families who don#t have access to that luxury should not feel that their children#s le chances are diminished as a result.Children and young people are under immense pressure at the minute. There is no justiable reason to make that worse.Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan praised the decision.This is absolutely necessary to allow our teachers, school staff and of course children to prepare for ato school, rather than the stress of a high-level exam, she said.Academic selection is wrong and unnecessary and puts undue pressure on children.I am hopeful that the other selective schools will follow the leadership and the example shown by the schools in Newry.Education Minister Peter Weir said his focus remained on providing support to pupils in key transition years. For as long as academic selection is available as an option for schools to admit pupils to post-primary education across Northern Ireland, it is vitally important that there is a fair and transparent process in place for children undertaking selection tests, he told the Belfastlast night.My department has no role in the organisation of the transfer tests and it is up to inidual schools whether they choose to use academic selection.I understand that, given the current situation regarding Covid-, there is uncertainty and some understandable concern about the current planned tests in December .The matter was given very careful consideration and I consider that the revised plans which are being put in place are the best available at this time, the minister said.In the absence of any alternative solutions emerging, I believe the onus is on [transfer test organisers] PPTC and AQE to reassure children that the testing process will be fair and reasonable, and managed as carefully as possible given the level of disruption to pupils# education this year.My focus remains on looking at ways that my department can provide vital support to all pupils in those key transition years. In addition, I also want to ensure that work continues to provide much needed support to vulnerable and disadvantaged children when schools reopen.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Each month in lockdown #akin to a large recession#, says Economy Minister Diane DoddsEconomy Minister Diane Dodds has said each month in lockdown has been akin to a large recession for Northern Ireland.GalleryCoronavirus PremiumHow Northern Ireland hotels will look after lockdownSay bye bye to breakfast buffets, ciao to the concierge and hello to a  hour supply of hand sanitizer.Most ReadDUP MP Paisley #oops# moment as he sends email to hundreds joking about NI ExecutiveHow three NI people transformed their gardens in coronavirus lockdownAs NI#s lockdown eases where are people most at risk of picking up Covid- Coronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Each month in lockdown #akin to a large recession#, says Economy Minister Diane DoddsPolice issue warning to parents as sunny weather brings crowds out,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Increased infection will place our health workers under extreme pressure and will kill people in our community - that is both the brutal and sad reality.”Mr Maskey said that both young and old had a responsibility to protect the vulnerable in their communities.“As we approach this weekend, I am appealing directly to young people to please be part of the community Covid- response and to follow the guidelines.“You can enjoy the good weather and meet up with up to six friends outdoors while adhering to social distancing but large crowds are not permitted for the benefit of your health and our community.”The MP also called on parents and s to keep in touch with their children and know their whereabouts.“Only by working together will we overcome this, he said.Meanwhile, the RNLI have advised caution to those planning to attend beaches this weekend as no leguards will be on duty until later in June.“As we move to a gradual relaxing of restrictions as advised by the Northern Ireland Executive and we experience the good weather, we expect many people to be eager to visit the coast.” said Karl O’Neill, RNLI Lead Leguard Supervisor.“We ask those who are visiting beaches to continue to be aware of the inherent dangers and to avoid taking risks.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

Adhering to social distancing, they have been going door-to-door to capture portraits of families going about their daily lives under the extraordinary circumstances. Trevor Benson, who has been taking photographs of residents in Castledawson, said the reaction to the project has been very positive. He said: “People have been contacting asking ‘what time are you going to be up round this way ’ or ‘are you going to do our area ’ so it’s been good. “They have been sitting waiting, some at the windows or on the doorstep. I think it’s just giving them something to look back on. googletag.cmd.push “Some have said they’ll save it on Facebook and they’ll get a memory every year about it.” Much like the pandemic that inspired it, the project has taken on a worldwide appeal, with Kilrea photographer Carol McLaughlin first seeing it mentioned in America. “A girl from America, I think, started the idea of the doorstep project,” she said. “I’m in a group on Facebook called ‘Women in Photography’ and people said they were doing it in their areas, so I thought it would be really nice to do in our town. “I put a message up on my personal page because more people in the town would be on it, and got a really good response, so we went for it.” googletag.cmd.push As well as providing a record for future generations of what le was like during the  pandemic, the project has helped people to feel connected at a time when distance is in vogue. Photographing in Magherafelt, Joseph Cullen said the idea of connecting people really appealed to him. “A lady contacted me saying she was in England and she hasn’t seen her parents in Magherafelt since January and she was heartbroken about that. “They’re not very good at technology, so I went to their estate and took a nice photograph of them and recorded a video message from her parents to her in England. “It gave them a real sense of things going back to normal and being able to see them again. To be able to do that for people is brilliant.” Re-creating that feeling of connection for older people without access to social media led to John O’Neill going a step further. The Ballinderry photographer reached out specically to the village’s elderly population, with the help of some comprehensive local knowledge. “The third photograph in was Charlie Collins, who had a list made out of  people in the parish who were over , so it went on a bit from there,” he said. “I would say I was calling in an area on a certain day and people would get in contact. I arranged rough times that I would call so they were watching or a family member was keeping an eye out. “They were contacting me looking photos done. Because it was creating a buzz, I was getting phone calls from people not on social media. “A lady beside me said her phone lit up the next day and she was entertained all day by people phoning, saying they had seen her photograph on Facebook, so that was lovely. “They are sitting in the house on their own and a bit of a conversation on the phone was keeping the boredom at bay.” In keeping with the Loughshore parish’s unique character, local residents made sure to put their own spin on their portraits. “The black and white seemed to work well for the older generation. Some of them were putting their stamp on it,they were known for something or were a bit of a character,” said John. “I did Patrick McGuckin’s on Saturday evening and I jokingly said to one boy’ ‘I’ve to go up here and get Patrick and the we’s photo’ and he said, ‘I hope he’s on the sit-on lawnmower’. “Patrick cuts the football field, and sure as could be, Patrick was on the sit-on lawnmower whenever I went up! “There was the odd one needed a wee warning to get spruced up and that’s why I put the call out. They don’t want to be caught short – especially with no hairdressers at the minute!” With reasons to get dressed up currently at a premium, residents of all four areas took the opportunity to don the glad rags, with some going to extreme s. “In one family, the dad came out with make-up on and he was dressed up as a princess – clearly that’s what he’s been doing with his daughter in isolation!” said Carol McLaughlin. “There were a few that threw on a bit of tan and got dolled up. I had said to come whatever way they wanted, so they could get dolled up or come out in their jammies – whatever way they normally spend their days.” Joseph Cullen, who is a member of Mid Ulster Photography Club along with Trevor Benson, said the residents of Magherafelt were also keen to impress. “Sometimes, everyone is dolled up to the nines, has their hair done and are in their best Sunday outfits,” he said. “We’ve had kids getting dressed up in superhero outfits and that kind of stuff. One family all wore matching outfits and some have got their pets involved.” With Covid- affecting work for photographers everywhere, all four that we spoke to were delighted to get out and about and taking pictures again. “My daughter came out with me and we went round the town for three days,” said Carol McLaughlin. “It actually worked out really well, and we got good weather, which helped. It was so nice getting back out with the camera again. “It was a nice, community thing to do. Everybody got involved and it was lovely to see it all at the end – everyone’s pictures of their time in isolation. “What made me want to do it was that it was a moment in history. It will always bring people back to that crazy time when we were all stuck indoors.” In the nostalgia-fuelled reminiscence of le under lockdown, Joseph Cullen feels traditional photography can play a role in preserving memories of the pandemic for posterity. “With the rise of camera phones, people don’t pay as much attention to traditional photography but actually going out of your way means you get some great photos,” he said. “People will forget, in a year or two, all the stuff they went through at the time and having photos helps.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that a Medical School at Magee had been agreed by the Executive with an anticipated September  opening. However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood amongst others sought further detail saying student intake next year was ‘far from certain’. Speaking at a Stormont debate on the Budget Bill this week, DUP MLA Mervyn Storey - a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board - challenged the way finances have been distributed. googletag.cmd.push To fulfil the commitment made to police officers in the New Decade, New Approach document would cost poundm per year, he said, which the finance minister has available. He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In responseSinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now in terms of progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

It signalled the start of the countys , but on a national level they were nowhere close to toppling Kerry. This week, Michael McMullan trawls back through the record books. The  All-Ireland was the model title. An underage production line, with  clubs represented on Chris Browns starting team brought Tom Markham back north. It was a performance that warmed the cockles of the Derry fans. Expressive football, mixed with Michael McGoldrick, Gerard OKane and Joe Keenan leading a defence that broke the hearts of forward lines across the land. googletag.cmd.push The following year, with six of the team underage, the Oakleafers were tipped for glory again until Damian Daisy McDermotts goal grabbed victory for Tyrone in the first round. It began a tale of woe for Derrys minor grade, which petered off after Magheras  Hogan Cup win and MacLarnon Cup win  months earlier for St Columbs Derry. Like decades before it, school and county minor success drip-fed into the overall pick for senior managers, an addition to the clubs pathway. The county U team didnt push on like it needed to either. The All-Ireland minor final of  was a rare highlight in a -year drought. Aside from that run, the county registered only three other first round wins –  ,  and until Damian McErlains side sparked the current resurgence. googletag.cmd.push At school level, there was also a blip. St Pius Magherafelt and St Pauls Kilrea both won All-Irelands in , but that was the end of the line until Maghera rose from the ashes again. Derry won back to back Buncrana Cups at U level, but were shocked by Fermanagh at minor level in  when it was their minor time, as the rut continued. In the senior ranks, the county were in a strong position. A NFL title came to Derry in , with a run to the final the following year – both against Kerry. There was a run to the Ulster U final. Ballinderry, Greenlough and Lissan all reaching Ulster club finals at their respective grades, with Shamrocks minors picking up a fourth minor title at St Pauls. Not pushing on from here, as a county, was a missed opportunity. Things began to fall away. Three years in Division  followed, before a rise back to the top level and another league final and a hammering by the all-conquering Dubs. Then came a free-fall from the top. Score dference saved Damian Barton from a drop to Division  in  but this was followed by back to back relegations before Damian McErlain steered them back from the basement. Macker has since stepped down, to be replaced by Rory Gallagher, but before Covid- brought sport to a standstill, Derrys chances of ato Division  were unlikely at best. Looking back at Derrys comparison with Kerry, the Kingdom have won two All-Ireland U U titles since Derrys  triumph. Former Kerry senior boss Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice was on the winning team in  and and lack of silverware at that grade worries him. Fitzmaurice handed  senior debutsto players from the minor teams of  to . Peter Keane, a minor selector under Mickey Ned O Sullivan in  and  before succeeding Jack OConnor as manager for the remainder of the five-in-a-row, took the number to  when appointed as senior boss. Fourteen have played in the championship. In the same time window, playing two and three tiers below Kerry,  Derry players have made it through to senior level. Paul McNeill, Peter Hagan and Danny Tallon played under Richard Ferris in , the rest were part of Damian McErlains minor tenure, with  in all graduating to championship level. The staggering statistic is the contrast with Kerry, in scoring power, from players who have came through. Derrys  minor team was a well-organised unit. Shane McGuigan was the reason they won the Ulster title and he still remains the best forward in the county by some margin. He has scored - in  senior games. With - in  outings, Danny Tallon is a long way back in second place. Paudie McGrogan , Conor Dohertyand Alex Doherty, with -, are next. Compare that to Kerry. Seaacuten OSheas  games brought him a tally of -, David Clfordhas scored -. Killian Spillane, with three of his Templenoe club-mates, bridged the gap from minor to the senior  by playing in the Kerry junior team. Last year, in his debut senior season, Peter Keane handed him a fth championship start in an All-Ireland final and he bagged -. Dara Moynihan, Miceaacutel Burns and defender Tom OSullivan have all contributed to the scoreline. Stats are indicators and dont always tell the full story. Style of play is an influence. Rory Gallagher was slated before a ball was kicked with Derry about his defensive brand of football. From watching games this year and under previous Derry managers, Rory is no dferent. Two men and sometimes one stay up front. There is a link player and everyone  appears briefed with flooding the middle and keeping possession. From watching the teams Derry come up against, what  are you supposed to do. Louth and Tipperary came to the muck and clabber of Celtic Park and parked the bus. Maybe even two or three. Damian McErlain found the same. And every manager before him, struggling to play against the blanket. Remember the  Division  league final  Derry went through a spell of giving the ball away cheaply. Against a Kerry or a Dublin they wouldve got hammered. From talking to Kerrys Eye Sports Editor, Sylvester Hennessy, an analyst under Peter Keane, who is now helping with Limerick. He points out the dference is night and day, once you go down the isions. You still need killer forwards to play attacking football at senior level. Much is talked about youth football, but the Derry club scene isnt coming down with enough candidates. I am thinking of Derrys trip to Paacuteirc Esler. They were squeaky clean in possession. In fact, their setup was spot on. With another steady head and an eye for a score, theyd have beaten both Down and Leitrim. Thats the reality. Organisation and brawn will only take you so far. Finishers win prizes. Even Donegal, who were so negative in the McKenna Cup clash with Derry, are expressive when they head out of Ulster. Hennessy, like Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice, speaks of the attacking brand of football in Kerry. Fitzmaurice stresses how kids want to be the next Gooch, Clford or Mickey Sheehy. He mentions the way football is played allows forwards to develop their craft. Both men mention the  U Paul McGirr final, a thriller won by Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne after extra-time. Fitzmaurice remembers and asks about the blondie fellaup front for Maghera. Hennessy was covering the game and also enquired of Dohertys progress. Eacuteamonn refers to Magheras impressive Hogan Cup final performance in  and Danny Tallons name comes up in the conversation. Conor Converys nine points in the  semi-final win was enough for Fitzmaurice to have his prize defender Brian Oacute Beaglaoich keep tabs on him in the final. “I would have often have seen a lot of similarities between the Derry style of play and the Kerry style of play,” offers Fitzmaurice of his playing days. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” Going forward, it has been encouraging to see Paul Cassidy and Matthew Downey at club level in the past year. Cassidys performance to save Derry Us from defeat against Armagh was tantalising. Shane McGuigan is crying out for help. As a trio, it could be a decent foundation. Behind this, schools, club and county coaches must produce more of the same from the wheelie bin type coaching of lockdown. With it, needs to come a pressure to change the outlook. Defensive football is perfect for stabilising a team. Derry and Kerry minors were the perfect example. Niall Keenan marked their  dangerman Conor Geaney out of the game, but up popped the unknown quality of Michael Foley to sink Derry. As for the Kingdoms  and  model, they would just give you nightmares. The elephant in the room, one that cant be ignored is the colossal turnover of players. From the start of Damian Bartons tenure, in , Derry have used  playersin league and championship, with  featuring in the latter. To give the numbers some context, Donegal reached three Ulster finals, winning two, during this same spell, using  players in league and championship. Monaghan have used  players. This is something that Derry are going to have to nail,the current underage development is going to bear any fruit. Between players leaving , managers having dferent opinions and the lure of the US in the summer - its impossible for anything to blossom. There is a culture of expectation to be a starter and when players are not making the cut, pressure comes from club managers about wasting their time with the county. Granted, it is easier for a  player to hang around many of the top counties with the chance of winning silverware and the carrot of maybe a team holiday at the end of the season for getting to a final. Another huge issue is a lack of midfielders. When Down pushed up on Derry in Newry, there was nobody to pluck a ball from the skies. A qualier a few years ago against Laois was the same. There is not much you can do without the leather. Hand in hand with this, comes the debate about AFL. Conor Glass, Callum Brown and Anton Tohill were not the finished article. There is Kealan Friel coming through, a late bolter, as termed by U boss Mickey Donnelly, having not progressed through the county minors. The days of the short kick-out are fading. It does have its place, but without any size at midfield there can be no plan B. Like the lack of scoring forwards, ato producing midfielders needs to figure high up any coaching plan for the future. One that must start now. Unless club, school and county are united, and properly, then little change can be expected. And Gerard OKanes team of  and Derrys  senior team will be as far away as ever.

He is now in his second year as Principal of Dingles Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne, who he managed to successive Hogan Cups. He handed senior debuts to  players who played minor against Derry. He spoke to Michael McMullan... *** A  minute phone-call to Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice is time well-spent. The former Kerry boss is as interested as he is interesting. Calm. Concise. A listener and a talker in equal measure. “No problem,” comes the response earlier in the week, to a request for a Kerry angle on an Ulster minor football feature. A peek into the county who know it better than most. A county where football chat ebbs around every corner and silverware is the only currency. googletag.cmd.push Derry went  years without an Ulster minor title. Gradually the wheels of change are beginning to turn. We start our conversation with Kerrys shortfalls. From  until the golden minor generation, Tom Markham didnt set foot inside Kerry. In the senior ranks, by the time Liam Hassett lted Sam, it was  years since  skipper Tommy Doyle carried it into his native Annascaul. A real famine in these parts. - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom. More... As the noughties began, Sam came to visit more often. “There were senior All-Irelands being won and there were no minors being won, so it wasnt as much of a concern,” Fitzmaurice said of the his playing career at the start of the millennium. googletag.cmd.push One or two players coming off a minor production line added to an already strong senior core. Its above that where his concern rests. At U level, a grade where Fitzmaurice, the player, annexed two All-Ireland U medals and found the net in the  win over Laois. “It is a better yardstick for players in terms of making it to senior afterwards,” he adds, looking through the eyes of an ex-senior manager. A sole title since, in , is a concern for him. The minor success was still great, he continues. Of the  players from the winning teams to have already tasted the senior championship, Fitzmaurice and Peter Keane dished out an equal number of debuts. Another eight have played in the league. “I think it is a case by case basis,” Fitzmaurice replies, when prompted about the decision to bring them in. Tom OSullivan, Barry OSullivan and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich, from his Hogan Cup winning team, were first. It is a delicate balancing act, he concedes. Finding the middle ground between giving players exposure and risking long-term prospects. “You have David Clford and the Seaacutenie OShea, they are the exception rather than the norm, who can come through and make an impact straight away,” he points out. Diarmuid OConnor played in the league once he stepped out of minor, just one game. Clford is the only one from the five minor teams to become a fully-fledged Kerry senior in his first year out of underage. “What you find with a lot of the other players, it does take a couple of seasons training with the senior squad,” he added. Five seasons passed before Peter Keane made Shane Ryan the regular senior goalkeeper, reaching an All-Ireland final in . Liam Kearney, minor captain in , wasnt a regular until this season. Another  graduate, Miceaacutel Burns, couldnt nail down a starting berth in the Dr Crokes team that defeated Slaughtneil in , but is now a Kerry regular. Killian Spillane went the scenic route via the All-Ireland junior winning team. “It has probably taken longer than they wouldve anticipated themselves to come through, but it is such a big jump up from minor to senior.” Fitzmaurice chips in with Dublins U success. The politans have won four titles in the last  years and lost last years final. “It takes a couple of seasons to come through and get ready to be at the level where you can really impact...to get used to the level of training, to be physically developed and mentally and emotionally be ready,” he believes. *** Kerrys minor run had to start somewhere. It was a collective, according to Fitzmaurice. Development squads were a big factor, as well as having former Kerry players teaching in the locals schools. The local influence was massive. Jack OConnor is in Colaacuteiste na Sceilge, Liam Hassett is Deputy Principal in St Michaels Listowel. Marc Oacute Seacute is in The Green in Tralee. “They are willing to give time to develop the school teams,” stresses Fitzmaurice, who also has help from an unlikely source in Chorca Dhuibhne. Back in , when Fitzmaurice was Kerry U manager, he knew the season was going to clash with the schools football season. Tommy Grfin runs a pub in Dingle and the hours were never going to clash with school training. Plus, with many of the pupils coming from Tommys native Dingle, the local club would benefit. He gladly agreed. “That was a big factorand other schools have done that, where people were available and were happy to come in to help - it was completely voluntary. It was a coup and a half for us, that someone like that would get involved.” Donal Daly is another link. He played with Fitzmaurice on Kerry teams and operates a hands-off approach in his role as Kerry GAAs Games Manager. He uses his experience from the county scene to oversee and trust people. Allowing them to paddle their own canoe, yet pull the strings together at the same time. “Thats been very effective and has worked well,” Eacuteamonn comments, while also acknowledging the efforts of clubs. “When you put it all together, then a lot of very good players have been developed over the last  or  years and it has certainly worked.” Relationships are important. The school versus county minor loggerheads is a common scenario. But, with Jack OConnor at the helm with the minors in  and , it was the perfect scenario. Fitzmaurice had a good working relationship from playing under Jack with Kerry, and later alongside him as a senior selector. “We had an arrangement that the players spent most of the time with us , played most of the football with us and when the dferent Kerryteams got knocked out along the way, they spent more time with the minors,” Fitzmaurice explains.  Mark OConnor and Brian Oacute Beaglaoich show off the Hogan Cup Four days after the  Hogan Cup final win over Maghera, Kerry played their first minor championship game, a comfortable win over Clare. OSullivan and Oacute Beaglaoich lined out in defence. Current AFL player Mark OConnor and Barry OSullivan were at midfield, Cathal Bambury was in attack, with Tomaacutes Oacute Seacutecoming off the bench. “That was certainly a challenge for the minor management,” he concedes. “They had a bunch of players coming in, who they not seen a huge pile of. “That became the model for other years when Peter Keane became involved , Tommywas a selector with him so there was crossover and co-operation.” St Brendans Killarney followed up with two Hogan Cups. In Fitzmaurices opinion, there was no masterplan, yet it worked. Co-operation, communication and trust, the three words he rolls out. The minor management knew the players would be primed for action. “It has definitely stood usin good stead at colleges and minor level, thankfully it has worked out from our perspective.” *** Trotting down the Cusack Stand corridor, with swapped jerseys slung over their shoulders, the Kerry minors chiselled physique matched their silky skills of the previous hour. When asked about the provision for strength and conditioning, it was done within the school with advice from the minor setup. Given the size of Kerry, pooling for central sessions wasnt feasible. Again, Fitzmaurice drops in the word balance. Between conditioning for the minor season and playing in the schools performance phase and knock-out football. “We got advice on what the minors were doing and what we could do in the school. In the winter time, we did gym work in school and took it into the minor season.” Chorca Dhuibhne could avail of Tomaacutes Oacute Beaglaoich, a teacher in the school. Though not fully qualied , he had knowledge, which he mixed with the advice offered by the county experts and supervised the sessions. “It is an awkward balancing act. We fed into it and tried to do it as best we could. In The Sem , they had Arthur Fitzgerald, who had been involved in the strength and conditioning with Kerry minor and U teams,” Fitzmaurice explains. “I think, across the county, there is joined up thinking from the development squads right up to senior level as to what the best route way is for players and the best way to manage it. “It is a challenge because of all the football players get to play, to balance that with physically developing them. It worked out quite well for us, in that a lot of it was a common-sense approach.” *** One aspect of the school versus county situation across Ulster, was the clash of the MacRory and MacLarnon Cup players and U squads, due to the changing of grades to U and U. It forced players into making choices and balancing spinning plates. Fitzmaurice feels that it is always fair to give new ideas a chance and allow experimentation. Two years down the track, he can now make up his mind. “I think the older age groups , for me, worked better,” he answers, with the experience of the pathway both as a player and manager. “The way it is now, you have a lot of lads doing their leaving cert, they are playing Us and Im not convinced it works. “I think U is a better age-group, by the time they are finished they have a good grounding at the end of the development phase and getting ready to make their mark at senior level.” Comparing the Derry and Kerry minor teams of -, the scoring s and a better balance to Jack OConnor and Peter Keanes teams was the game-changer. “Forwards dont tend to be a huge problem for us, they seem to be part of the identy of Kerry football,” states Fitzmaurice, while feeling the county needs more steeliness in their defence. A couple of hard as nails defenders, he jokes. Does he feel this attacking flair comes from the standard of club football, tradition down through the years or more expression being encouraged  After a brief pause, he feels its a combination of all three. “The standard of coaching and club football is very good here. Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team. They had a great forwards, they had the Bradleysand they were hard to contain. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” The Kerry man would have often likened the Derry style of play to Kerry. And people down here know their football. The roll of honour reinforces that. RELATED - Fitzmaurice on the lure of Australia More... - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom.

Every generation growing up, they are looking at Mikey Sheehy, then you are looking at Maurice Fitzgerald, then the Gooch and now Clford. There is always someone to look at and to learn from, so that helps.” The Kerry style of play, he continues, does allow forwards to express themselves more - particularly at younger age groups. All emphasised by the county board coaches around the schools. Fitzmaurice feels the standard of coaching, all over Ireland, is of a high standard, with resources and clinics for coaches to improve. “At the younger age groups there would be a huge emphasis on skill development, getting all the basic skills and going up through the grades, particularly as they get older, the players themselves get more competitive. “It is not enough to have the skills, they need the grounding, the basics and fundamentals at a good level so they can start to aim at winning things. It becomes a bit more serious and tactical, but at the younger age groups there would be a lot of freedom.” The conversation heads to a conclusion, with his impression of Derry. From playing, managing and being at the coalface of underage at school. Alex Dohertys performance in the Paul McGirr final gets a mention. Growing up, do Kerry players have a better chance to flourish  “The way football is played down here , they have a bit more time to develop their craft whereasyou are playing a very defensive-orientated culture it is hard. “Playing against Derry myself, and watching Derry in the recent past they have played a bit more defensive. “There was a time when Derry,you think back  years ago or certainly when I was playing, they were very much a strong physical team and they were a kicking team. They had a great forwards, they had the Bradleysand they were hard to contain. “That is dferent over the past couple of years for sure, I wouldve thought in the past that the forward culture wouldnt have been that dferent between the two counties.” The Kerry man would have often likened the Derry style of play to Kerry. And people down here know their football. The roll of honour reinforces that. RELATED - Fitzmaurice on the lure of Australia More... - Opinion: Sideline View measures Derry up against the Kingdom.

The armed forces have been helping out across the UK building emergency hospitals, delivering vital supplies and much more. UK government staff based all across the world have also been helping UK citizens to get home to the UK during the global Coronavirus outbreak. Today we look at how members of Government departments have been helping solve some of the problems created by the coronavirus outbreak.

There were , Armed Forces personnel stood at readiness to assist civil authorities, of which nearly , have already been deployed. Military reservists have also been mobilised as part of the COVID Support Force and used in a range of activities, from providing medical and logistical support to deploying their own professional skills, such as accounting and construction. The help from the UK’s armed forces during the Coronavirus outbreak has taken a number of dferent forms. The Armed Forces have deployed dozens of military planners across the UK, which has seen them working with Local Resilience Forums and Partnerships, alongside the Emergency Co-ordination Centres in Scotland and Wales supporting public services, local authorities and emergency services. googletag.cmd.push The UK Armed Forces’ efforts have included working with specialists from Boots Pharmacists to train testing personnel, the provision of military testers to regional testing centres and the delivery of vital testing equipment. Military personnel are also currently working to distribute PPE to NHS trusts and organisations across the country. Up to May , Armed Forces personnel had helped to deliver over . billion items of PPE to NHS staff in England. Six military specialists have also been deployed to assist NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde with the fitting of FFP face masks. A new COVID Aviation Task Force has been established. This includes two RAF Puma based in Kinloss Barracks to help the NHS in Scotland and Northern England. Support has included training key workers in ious locations around the Western Hebrides in medical evacuation procedures and supporting NHS staff, plus helping with five medical evacuations in England and Scotland.  MERCY MISSION: Members of the UK Armed Forces work with NHS medical staff and Air Ambulance Service crews onboard a Puma HC helicopter at Thruxton Aerodrome in Andover, England Special charter flights bring , British travellers back home More than , British travellers have ed to the UK on  special Government charter flights from  dferent countries and territories since the outbreak of coronavirus. Foreign and Commonwealth Office staff have been working around the clock with the airline industry and host governments across the world to help bring back British travellers. Up to pound million has been made available for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable travellers. So far, charter flights have ed British nationals to the UK from countries ranging from Bolivia to Bermuda and New Zealand to Nepal. Government staff have also helped ensure travellers on commercial routes can get home, including , passengers who have ed from Spain. Around  British nationals have ed from Kenya on five commercial flights, which would not have been possible without the work of our High Commission in Nairobi. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also helped more than , British passengers who were aboard  cruise ships disembark. A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting toto the UK has also been put in place. The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options. Working to end extreme poverty across the world The Department for International Developmentleads the UK’s work to end extreme poverty. The UK is an international development superpower, and we are also a scientic and medical world leader. UK-based scientists, such as those at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine are playing key roles in the global response to this deadly new virus. Through the DFID aid budget, the UK is the largest single national contributor to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations international efforts to find a vaccine. Through this fund, we are working to improve our understanding of the virus and to support scientists around the globe – CEPI is already backing nine potential vaccines. Once a vaccine is found, delivering it globally will be the next big challenge. To help that, the Government has invested the equivalent of pound million a year for the next five years in Gavi, the global vaccine alliance that delivers vaccines in  of the poorest countries around the world. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCMvRxrHcOkCFXNoFQgdwFYCw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\"If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

Terence McDowell, principal of St Eithnes Primary School, has also supported calls from church leaders for the  plus transfer test to be scrapped this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Education Minister last week said it was his aim to see a phased reopening of schools across the North, starting with limited provisionfor GCSE, A-Level and P pupils this summer. Mr McDowell said he first learnt of the Education Ministersplans from the news and had not been consulted about them. googletag.cmd.push It was the first we heard of it and a lot of questions would need to be answered first, said Mr McDowell. The Minister wasnt very definite about the plans. Mr McDowell said he feels very sorry for his P pupils who face the possible prospect of moving on to post-primary school without the chance to say goodbye. My heart goes out to them, said Mr McDowell.For the other primaries we will eventually get them back and we can make up for the missed time, but for the Ps you can never replace that time. There are so many rites of passage like their school trip that they will never get to do and they will go into post primary without preparation that we would normally give them for what is a such a big change. googletag.cmd.push If the plans go ahead, it will give us some formof contact and offer some closure to both pupils and staff. The P teachers were told they might not see these pupils again with just two days notice. Staff at St Eithnes PS had already created a DVD for P pupils and a certicate to mark the end of their time at the school. Its always sad to see pupils go, but it will beall themore poignant this year, said Mr McDowell. Under Minister Weirs plans, primary schools and post primary schools would reopen with limited provision for key cohort years in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils at the beginning of September. However, teachers would traditionally be on annual leave during the school summer break in July and August. Teachers have been working really hard preparing online resources and work packs to keep pupils going, said Mr McDowell. We dontknow what the requirementswill be, but I believeit will be  pupils to a classroom. We have almost  in our two P classes so they will need to be split into two rooms and that will require more staff. The physical layout of desks and chairs will need to be considered and the resources they are using. We have already discussed requisitioning inidual resource packs for each child but that will come at an extra expense to the school and Im sure we wontget any extra resources. Mr McDowell said the movement of pupils outside the classrooms would also be a concern. We need to consider how the children will move around the school as the corridors arent very wide. We also need to think about meal times in the canteen, where normally we would have one or two slots to feed the whole school. Toilet breaks will need to be consideredtoo and time given for children to properly wash their hands. This will all be time taken out of teaching time. Keeping the childrentwo metres apart staff and each other would be particularlydficult for younger pupils. Children in P naturally gravitate towards one another, said Mr McDowell. You cant police that, it is going to be impossible. Things happen at school where children fall and hurt themselves and they will need comforted. Do we have to tell a child with a bleeding to chin to wait while we ring their parents  Some children will find the transition to primary school dficult and they might be crying or upset. To not be able to comfort that child goes against the grain of the very reasons that teachers came into this profession. Last week,Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown sent a letter to Catholic post-primary schools asking for the transfer test to be scrapped this year, a call echoed by Mr McDowell. The transfer test causes much anxiety anyway and our teachers have been unable to prepare children in the normal way this year and working from home just doesnt compare. It is causing much anxiety and we need to consider something to stop that. There isnt a levelplaying field in what parents can provide. They might be working from home, they might have multiple children, they might be looking after an elderly relative. Every household is unique. I am very mindful that parents have been thrust into the role of teachers, they are not professional teachers. Parents shouldnt compare themselves to others. We always tell the children just do your best and thats the same message I would have for parents. They are doing the best they can. Meanwhile, Derry Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan, has called for an`education forum comprising of teachers, school leaders, parents, trade unions and public health experts to be convened before schools are allowed to . The deputy chair of the assembly education committee, said the forum, would address huge concern and anxiety at the prospect of an eventualto school. Its my view that anyto school must be done in complete partnership and in conversation with all those involved in education when the time comes, said Ms Mullan. Parents, young people and our teaching staff must have confidence that health and safety is paramount in anyto school. There will be no one size fits all approach for schools in preparing to re-open. There should be an intense period of discussion that will be crucial to understand the flexibilities and the bespoke needs that dferent schools and dferent settings will require.

Emma McClughan hopes to raise over pound, from selling prints of her painting, which has captured the imagination of her friends and colleagues. Her image captures the worry felt by the crews in the ambulance and on the Air Ambulance in the form of aangel and hope is represented in the form of a rainbow. The Magherafelt woman initially posted her painting on social media and was overwhelmed by the response and positivity of the comments, with people offering to buy the painting outright. googletag.cmd.push Having worked closely with the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , Emma decided to donate any money raised from the sale of the prints to Air Ambulance NI. Breige Mulholland of AANI welcomed the donation and reiterated the importance of fundraising activities for the charity. “We are so touched that Emma has used her talents in such a heartfelt and positive way in recognition of all that NIAS and AANI do  days of the year,” she said. “As a charity, we need to raise poundm a year to keep the HEMS operational. Due to the virus all fundraising events in aid of AANI have been axed and our community are no longer able to support in the usual ways. googletag.cmd.push “Yet trauma incidents continue to occur, and public support is crucial. We thank Emma for her creativity and generosity.” NIAS Chief Executive, Michael Bloomfield, also praised Emma’s generosity. He said: “The fact that Emma’s first thoughts were that this should be sold to raise money for the Charity Air Ambulance speaks to her as a person. “It reflects a generosity of spirit which is so common among our young people and which is getting a chance to shine, like a rainbow, in these dark days. “I am constantly in awe of NIAS staff. Every day they give their all for patients and many go over and above what is expected of them. “They are all being asked to give more at this time and I am so proud of the manner in which they have risen to the challenge. But over the past couple of months, we have all been lucky to have been given an insight into some of their other talents – musical, dancing, poetry and now artistry. “This image is one that has touched the hearts of many in the way in which it shows that we are all in this together and that there will be brighter days for us all to enjoy again.” Prints of Emma’s painting can be purchased from the Air Ambulance website – www.airambulanceni.org.

DUP Alderman Graham Warke said many people from the local area travelled  miles to Lisburn to visit the Lagan Valley Leisureplex which has a number of swimming pools and state-of-the-art facilities. He said Derry City and Strabane District Council should be looking to create a similar facility. Alderman Warke was speaking today at the councils monthly meeting during a discussion on the future of local leisure facilities. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon brought a motion before the meeting asking the council to note the public disappointment at the lack of progress to date to advance the construction and re-development of Templemore Sports Complex in Derry and Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane. googletag.cmd.push The motions stated: “This motion calls on Council to prioritise the development of those long outstanding projects by bringing forward a report to the Council meeting in September to include the identication of all funding options available and a timetable towards completion so that the Council can consider its options.” Alderman Warke told the meeting his party would support the motion but added that he believed the council should use the opportunity to look at ways of improving its leisure facilities even further. He said he had travelled with his family to the Lagan Valley Leisureplex because of the facilities. He said he knew other local families who had done the same. googletag.cmd.push Alderman Warke said the council now had an opportunity to look at creating a similar leisure facility which could attract thousands of people. He added that the council should aim big. In relation to Cllr Mellons motion, SDLP councillor John Boyle proposed an amendment which would replace the word prioritise with the word accelerate. Cllr Boyles amendment proposal was supported by  councillors and opposed by ten. The reworded motion was then passed unanimously at the meeting.

Among those lining up tovoice the nations thanks to Irelands frontline workers will beUachtaraacuten na hEacuteireann,Michael D.Higgins,in an interview which will be pre-recorded at the gardens atAacuteras an Uachtaraacutein. googletag.cmd.push Her stunning performance ofNothing Compares Uin September was a stand-out moment of the currentseason, and on Friday night, the inimitableSineacutead OConnorwill beback in studio for another performance.There will be a strong touch of Hollywood on the show, withSaoirse Ronanchatting to Ryan.Colin Farrellwill also be joining the show from LA. Irelands record goalscorerRobbie Keanewill discuss how his experience of the pandemic inspired him to fundraise for those working in hospitals around Ireland, andSibeacuteal Niacute Chasaidewill be in studio with a special performance dedicated to all those who have lost their lives during the crisis. Ryan Tubridysaid: As we reach the end of this extraordinary season, I want to thank the frontline workers who came on the show in September with such grace and dignity and were acknowledged by the Irish public for their work. Fast forward a number of months and they did not let us down, they went on to serve the country in a way that we have never seen before. They have been amazing, as are their families who have had to sit by and watch the sacrices being made on a daily basis. googletag.cmd.push I also want to thank the viewers of The Late Late Show, who stayed with us each week and supported charities, putting their hands in their pockets to help the neediest among us. I want to thank the team behind the scenes, the crews, everyone inRTEacutewho showed up to keep the show on the road. Also, thanks to the many musicians for showing up and doing their bit and helping charities along the way. This season we lost Gay Byrne, such an iconic person in my le, professionally and personally. We also had to say goodbye to Marian Finucane and Larry Gogan - all true legends of Irish broadcasting. It has been an emotional, dficult, poignant, and joyful season overall.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue.

Thirty years of the Troubles didnrsquot close us down but I suppose we all just have to put up with it as these are unprecedented times.Despite the first steps being taken to open churches Fr McKinley cautioned it could be quite some time before the parishes could resume their normal schedule.ldquoSt Malachyrsquos in Castlewellan holds over  people. I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

He then raised the alarm with their parents, Valerie and Declan senior, who rushed to be with their son.Paramedics were quickly on to the scene, but on the way to Belfastrsquos Royal Victoria Hospital , the teenager needed a le-saving blood transfusion due to his major internal injuries.The ambulance was met in Greyabbey by a doctor and the emergency helicopter team where the procedure was carried out before Declan continued on to hospital by air.The Year  student from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, Downpatrick, later underwent eight hours of surgery to save him.Two and a half weeks later, Declan was back at home recovering with his family and vowing to get back on to a tractor as soon as he is fit and able.Eoin, who also attends St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick, wants to give another person a chance of survival.He has started a Just Giving appeal to fund the provincersquos helicopter emergency medical serviceand raise at least the pound, it costs to run it per day. The family has now raised nearly pound,, including gt aid for the service as their thanks for saving Declan.Mrs Keating says her son has a ldquolong road to recovery with rehabilitation and further surgery down the line but they are ldquoforever indebted to the air ambulance and the entire hospital team who cared for Declan. She said surgeons told her that he was ldquoextremely lucky as the accident could have had fatal consequences.Reliving the morning of the accident when Declan mdash whose nickname is lsquoThe Milkmanrsquo mdash and Eoin had just left home to go their unclersquos farm for the milking at am, is still traumatic for Mrs Keating.She said: ldquoI donrsquot like to think about what happened to Declan. For what happened and how it happened, itrsquos nothing short of a miracle for him to be here. We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps. Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything. It was just the fillip that I required.

It will mean people can enjoy an evening together while still maintaining social distancing in the comfort of their own car.As a start, Cllr Devlin is keen to see a drive-in cinema in Newcastle to mark the start of her year in office.She explained that this would allow the local authority to gauge its success and how it complements the legislation on social distancing.ldquoHopefully after this, we may be in a position to roll this venture out across the entire district over the course of the year and include all our towns, said Cllr Devlin.ldquoAlready, this idea has gained a lot of support from local people which I think is a testament to the need that currently exists within all of us to connect and eventually interact with our family and friends once more.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoThe test of how we unlock this will be in how we can continue to adhere to essential government guidelines on social distancing and ultimately defeating this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul running in aid of MYMY  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man who has been running five kilometres every day since the beginning of the lockdown has raised over pound, for a local mental health charity.Paul Tumelty found himself with more time on his hands when the seaside coffee shop he worked in was forced to close its doors under government guidelines to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.The  year-old father of two, says he never thought of running until he saw a Facebook post from Mind Your Mate and Yourself , stating that the charity was struggling financially.It was forecasting ain income of pound, because of the cancellation or postponement of fundraising events.Paul, who has suffered from mental health issues, realised the importance of the charity after experiencing a number of family tragedies and decided he would help raise money to help them bridge the deficit.ldquoI always need to be doing something.

are recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

It will help boost the entire thoroughbred industry.ldquoWe very much understand that racing will be behind closed doors for the foreseeable future and will work diligently to comply with the very strict protocols put in place to ensure the safety of all those attending.The July date was announced by the Board of Horse Racing Ireland, which met recently and agreed a number of fixtures for theof race meetings.The first meeting is at Naas on June , with National Hunt racing resuming at Limerick on June .For the first three weeks, racing will be restricted to nine racecourses which are more centrally located to minimise travel distances and which also have higher stable capacities given the requirement for one stable per horse under the new protocols.All the fixtures will take place under the strict protocols published by Horse Racing Ireland.Brian Kavanagh, chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, said: ldquoWe are grateful to everybody for the patience they have shown during this very dficult time and we will provide every opportunity for essential personnel to fully understand and implement theto racing protocols.ldquoWe expect there to be signicant demand for horses to run once we resume, and we will aim to provide opportunities across the spectrum of age, gender and ability.ldquoWe will have missed  weeksrsquo racing which will take some time to catch up.

However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th May 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

Unfortunately many other projects Ashling had planned for this year have currently been placed on hold.She said: “Last year I received an ACES award from the Arts Council and I’ve been using that to develop my own picturebook texts in Irish and English. The Covid- pandemic has meant that the publication of those is now delayed but on the positive side, it has given me the time to think about how my experiences and skills may be able to help others.”Thanks to the Arts Council and the National Lottery players Ashling is planning to develop a series of online videos showing the art process behind her work, painting, drawing, and printmaking.She explained: ‘‘The point of this project is to skill share, show some of the process, and engage with the community through free digital content that is easily accessible for people remotely.”Damian Smyth, head of Literature, Arts Council of Northern Ireland added: ‘‘Artists have been among the hardest hit groups, with projects delayed, venues closed and events cancelled for the foreseeable future. All of this is having a major impact on our cultural and creative lives. ‘‘Over the next few months, I’m really looking forward to seeing how Ashling’s project develops, encouraging others who maybe have an idea they wish to develop or perhaps want to reconnect with their creative side to, quite literally, get back to the drawing board.”*Ashling’s tutorials will be available on www.ashlinglindsay. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

Co Armagh Orangemen go above and beyond call of dutyOrangemen in Co Armagh have raised more than £, to help those fighting against coronavirus and those worst affected by lockdown.By Graeme CousinsThursday, th May , : pm\"\"Bessbrook District made a special delivery of a food pack to Bro Thomas Alderdice in Kilkeel : Other rd PartyDistrict and private lodges have provided food hampers for its own members and other vulnerable people in the community, donated to frontline NHS staff, raised cash for charity and boosted PPE provision in the area.Right Worshipful Brother Denis Watson, county grand master, said: “The money we’ve raised has gone towards assisting all communities and, as the largest community-based organisation within Co Armagh, it shows that the institution is so much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey Lawson, Deputy County Grand Secretary, presenting the cheque for £, to Jane McKimm, Head of Communications, and Helen ONeill, Director of Finance.at the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, for specic use at Craigavon Area Hospital : Other rd Party“The tremendous response from the County Grand Lodge was immediate and the monies came from existing funds, with no member asked to contribute, unless to do so in a voluntary capacity.”Support included preparing food hampers for elderly and vulnerable brethren, and others in the community, making donations of food and goodies to frontline hospital staff, making monetary donations to charities, and providing PPE to nursing homes and community nursing services.A substantial donation of £, was made to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, specically for Craigavon Area Hospital.Mr Watson said: “One of the first things put in place by the County Grand Lodge was the issue of a daily prayer from our County Grand Chaplain, Wor Bro Rev Dr Alan McCann, to members by email and posting on the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House, Loughgall Facebook page.County Grand Lodge Officers made a donation of £, to the Southern Area Hospice as they are currently unable to fundraise, and this was presented to Anne Dalzell, hospice representative, at Sloan’s House : Other rd Party“The response has been very favourable in these trying times, with the daily reach on Facebook being between  and over ,.”He added: “The museum at Sloan’s House was very proud to display the Grand Lodge banner of support for the NHS and other frontline services on the front of the building and encouraged young people to send in rainbow pictures for display on the front windows of the premises. “The County Grand Lodge central committee has been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\"

some of its events virtually.By The NewsroomThursday, th May , : pm\"\"The proposal to look at the feasibility of hosting certain events remotely was raised at Tuesday evening’s virtual meeting as members discussed a report recommending all Council led events are cancelled until the end of August.Council’s Head of Tourism, Artsand Culture, Brian Johnston, advised members there will be a further report in June that will give consideration to events held until the end of December .The report, circulated to members before the meeting, states that at present, events involving gatherings of people are not permitted and it is anticipated that when they are, other controls such as social distancing will be required.Some of the events recommended for cancellation include Buskfest in Banbridge Town Centre on June , Armed Forces Day in Banbridge Town Centre and Rugby Club on June  and the Seven Hills Blues Festival in Armagh which runs from August -.Other events for later in the year, including the Georgian Festival in Armagh and Halloween events across the borough and Christmas and twilight markets are all marked for further consideration.When asked by Banbridge Sinn Fein councillor, Kevin Savage why an estimate of council savings was not includedin the report Mr Johnston said Council would have spent £, on the events it now proposes to cancel.However, he did advise that not all of that will be saved by Council as some contractual obligations will need to be met.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon raisedthe possibility of holding some of these events virtually.“We are encouraging businesses to do things online,” said the Armagh representative.“If we could look at some of these events happening between now and Christmas and seethere is an opportunity to do similar with them, could we have that explored and brought back in due course ”Lurgan councillor Liam Mackle said: “I would be very happy with some virtual events taking place in the months ahead.”The Sinn Fein representative then proposed that Council officers explore this idea and report back in due course with the proposal seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.A message from the
