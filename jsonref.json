But the UKHSA has noted a small number of people who have been reinfected with BA.2 after recovering from Omicron. Other studies have pointed to the subvariant being significantly more immune-resistant than the original Omicron, which would make it easier to infect vaccinated or previously infected people.  Whitehall sources told The Times earlier this week that they had not seen any evidence of significant changes in behaviour. But Government adviser Professor Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist on SAGE, told MailOnline that there was a growing impression that Covid is \u0027yesterday\u0027s news\u0027 and causing people to be more lax.He claimed that even people who wanted to take precautions were being forced into more risky behaviours because the majority of restrictions have been lifted. But a number of experts, including Dr Simon Clarke, a microbiologist at the University of Reading, believe the uptick in cases and hospital admissions is the early sign of waning booster immunity.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) last month recommended fourth doses to the most vulnerable age groups this spring, telling ministers they should be dished out around six months after their last vaccine. JCVI advisers originally recommended third doses on September 14, with over-75s, care home residents and patients with serious underlying health conditions first in the queue. Pfizer\u0027s booster drops from 90 per cent effectiveness against severe disease from Omicron to around 75 per cent after 10 weeks, according to the latest data. "},{"url":null,"title":"Durham Students accuse university systemic cover following controversy Rod Liddle","story":"Share this articleDurham University students ask for content warnings after row over Rod Liddle speech | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Russia bans Instagram accuses Facebook owner Meta extremist organisation","story":"Share this article Several social media companies previously announced new content restrictions after the Ukraine invasion including blocking Russia state media RT and Sputnik in Europe.Russia blocked Facebook for \u0027discrimination towards Russian media\u0027 after it banned Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik in the UK at the request of the British government.Roskomnadzor also \u0027restricted access\u0027 to social media network Twitter, Russian news agencies reported last Friday. According to Interfax and RIA Novosti news agencies, access to Twitter was restricted on the basis of a request of the Prosecutor General from February 24. Russia has for more than a year been striving to curb the influence of US tech giants including Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google and Twitter, repeatedly fining them for allowing what it deems to be illegal content.But Putin\u0027s ruthless invasion of Ukraine, met by a storm of international condemnation and unprecedented sanctions, has sharply raised the stakes in the information war.Social media provides an opportunity for dissent against Putin\u0027s claims - followed by the tightly controlled state media - that Moscow was forced to launch its \u0027special military operation\u0027 to defend Russian-speakers in Ukraine against genocide and to demilitarise and \u0027denazify\u0027 the country.Meta\u0027s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp services are all popular in Russia, with 7.5 million, 50.8million and 67million users last year respectively, according to researcher Insider Intelligence.In another clampdown, Andrei Chernenko, Russia\u0027s deputy digital minister, called on Russian state-owned websites and portals to ramp up security by today.He ordered them to move to domestic services and remove JavaScript code downloaded from foreign sources after Anonymous hacked into Russia\u0027s media censorship agency and released 340,000 files.The minister also instructed web services to switch to domain name system (DNS) servers on Russian soil.The global DNS allows people around the world to use the internet easily and freely, indicating Russia could cut itself off from the system and implement its own.Russia claims the directive is only to enhance security in the face of repeated cyber attacks, but experts fear it is a sign Russia could disconnect itself from the global internet.Mikhail Klimarev, director of the Internet Protection Society, said: \u0027From the outside it looks like a preparation for the sovereign Runet.\u0027Today, Anonymous broke into the Roskomnadzor federal agency to steal the classified documents which they then passed on to transparency organisation Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets), who published them online.The trove of 820 gigabytes of emails and attachments, some of which are dated as late as March 5, show how the Kremlin is censoring anything referring to their brutal invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow is instead calling a \u0027special military operation\u0027. The Anonymous hacker said they \u0027urgently felt the Russian people should have access to information about their government\u0027, DDoSecrets said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55087744bc9867ab486190a105c31d18b547ef68/1_0_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3864dd7d1de33e6340491a17b8b8f079","title":"chelsea roman abramovich premier league team news and more live updates","story":"• Government sees Candy and Boehly-Wyss as serious buyersChelsea are in an unprecedented state of limbo after sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich, with the Russian oligarch barred from selling the club for the time being, but the feeling in Westminster is that the government believes the process of finding a new owner will not be derailed by this week’s dramatic developments. Read more below: “I’ve total empathy for him and for the players, but they’re very professional. They’re an outstanding team and I’m sure they’ll focus on that element between now and the end of the season.” Giovanni van Bronckhorst will assess John Lundstram and Joe Aribo, after both picked up injuries in the 3-0 Europa League win over Red Star Belgrade. For Mark McGhee’s side, Lee Ashcroft and Charlie Adam are major doubts while Adam Legzdins and Cillian Sheridan are both unavailable. Hearts host St Mirren on Saturday, and rivals Hibernian go to Motherwell on Sunday. Hibs have suffered a big injury blow, with the news that striker Kevin Nisbet could be out for nine months after undergoing knee surgery on Thursday.“If you want to look back later in life on very successful times, you should give absolutely everything now,” Klopp said. “We have no time and no points to waste.” “This idea of a crisis meeting. It’s just language and a lovely headline. It’s not a crisis, it is very normal ... the idea is we find the answer and solution. To hear players speak a bit is important for me and some players spoke and that’s good. But the ownership of it has to be mine as coach.  “I am fresh to the club so sometimes I find it a bit hard to take the constant negativity which kicks in instantly here when something goes wrong, because I don’t feel that. This is football, it happens and we have to correct it. The only way to correct it is by training well, showing resilience and showing character. That’s my message.”When asked about Abramovich, he said: “I can probably count on one hand how many times I’ve seen him in the last many years. I worked for Chelsea, which was an absolute pleasure for 13 years. And that’s where I want to leave that one.”The big change is that the awards will now be based on performances in a single season, rather than a calendar year. So the 2022 prizes will be based on the 2021-22 campaign, including the women’s Euros this summer. Performances at the men’s World Cup in Qatar will count towards the 2023 award. Beyond that, France Football are expanding the panel who draw up shortlists, and restricting votes to the world’s top 100-ranked nations. There will also be less focus on a player’s past achievements – all of which sounds like bad news for the Big Two. “We just started trying a bunch of things that we never talked about and we have to stay to the plan,” Marsch said. “If we don’t do that then we’re weaker. We see the weaknesses of our players and not the strengths. So that will certainly be a message. “I know with the fans you have to earn it. It’s not given, right? It’s the same with players, the same with directors ... but I’m not afraid. I’m here for the right reasons and I want to help this club be the things I really believe it can be.” One major positive for Marsch is that Patrick Bamford should be fit to make his first start since September, after coming on a substitute against Villa. For Norwich, Sam Byram, Christoph Zimmermann and Mathias Normann could all face late fitness tests.Asked if Ronaldo is content at United, Rangnick said: “I haven’t asked him if he’s happy at Manchester at this club, he’s fit again, resumed training yesterday and we shall see which formation we will line up with tomorrow.”“It doesn’t motivate me, absolutely zero, lower than zero,” he said of the prospect of three trophies. “These are fairytales. The reality is tough. Sport at a high level is so difficult.”“Selhurst Park is always a difficult place to go,” the Spaniard said. “It is a final for us and we know it. Hopefully we can prepare well to arrive on Monday in good shape to face the opponent. “Always in my mind when we start to play the last 10 games of the Premier League every game is a final. When you have to play 55 games it is not a final but when you have 10 games left it is a final.”They were also asked about the Chelsea fans chanting the name of Roman Abramovich at Norwich on Thursday night: Allan Saint-Maximin and Joelinton are both injury doubts for Newcastle.“He was really frustrated but he managed to get back on the field and his work ethic is unbelievable. He is a young player who wants to spend time on the field and wants to improve himself. He is in a really good place – playing well, enjoying his football, and it is good for the team.”While Conte has voiced his horror at the war and Russia’s actions, the Spurs manager says the impact on sporting stars is “very sad” given the dedication it takes to get to the highest level. “You have to pay for this situation, I think it’s not right. Honestly, I hoped the situation is going to be solved, because it’s creating a lot of damage. We’re in 2022 and to see this is horrible for everybody.” Conte was a former employee of Roman Abramovich and said: “We are talking about four or five years ago. At the time, Chelsea, also now, we’re talking about a fantastic club. With an owner that made this club big. Don’t forget that in the period he was the owner, Chelsea won everything. But it was for Chelsea. I think also we have seen other Russia owners in other teams. Not only in football but in many sports.”On Mo Salah’s contract talks, the Liverpool manager is asked whether the signing of Luis Diaz might convince the Egypt forward to sign a new deal. “I think Mo expects this club to be ambitious but it’s not about that, it’s a decision for Mo, it’s all fine with Mo at the moment from my point of view, nothing further has happened, so we’ll just have to wait for that – there’s no rush.”Here’s our story: “The uncertainty over the current ownership situation of Chelsea FC has been challenging,” Trivago said in a statement. “Moving forward, it is important to us to continue supporting the club, the fans and community along with the essential work that the Chelsea Foundation does to help those in need. We are looking forward to a transition of ownership as soon as possible and want to support the club in this process. We will provide any update to our business relationship if and when appropriate. “As a company of global citizens, we cannot condone the unprovoked and catastrophic invasion of Ukraine. We believe in a free world, freedom of speech and peace. We continue our efforts together with our teams to support the humanitarian efforts and to ease the suffering of the affected population. We stand with Ukraine.”City are hoping Nathan Ake and João Cancelo are fit after missing the Champions League nonevent against Sporting Lisbon through injury and illness respectively. Kyle Walker is also back in contention after being suspended for the Sporting game but Ruben Dias (thigh) is still out. For Palace Jean-Philippe Mateta, who has impressed of late, could again start up front while Joel Ward (groin) and Nathan Ferguson (hamstring) are set to miss out once again. James McArthur is also still absent with a knock after just completing his return from a hamstring problem.The American businessman Adam Binnie, whose family have made two bids for the club, told the BBC on Thursday that administrators had rejected their most recent bid of £30m and would not speak to them again unless they increased their offer. But administrators Quantuma said on Friday that there is still interest in buying the club. “The joint administrators are continuing to work with prospective purchasers who remain interested in buying the club,” the administrators’ statement said.“It is our duty to secure an appropriate valuation for Derby County and to ensure we have a suitable bid to present to the EFL.” They added that they wished to assure supporters that “discussions with interested parties are ongoing and focused on making the club financially sustainable for the long term”. The EFL said on 3 March 3 it had received assurances from the administrators that sufficient funds were in place to see out the season. The Binnie family has no appetite to increase its offer.“An index that uses the vast sums of funds from the TV revenues to reward well-run clubs, clubs that are financially sustainable and can survive without an owner benefactor.” Bowen has undergone scans but the club are still in the dark about the extent of the problem. “I have no idea at the moment,” said Moyes. “We’re still trying to clear up exactly the injury. In all the scans and information we have it does not look too bad, but his action coming off the pitch at Anfield made it look more serious than we thought. And that has not added up. “Since then Jarrod is slightly improving but not as fast as we hoped. We did not think it was anything serious. So we are still trying to get to the bottom of it.”On the pitch of course, Chelsea shrugged it all off with comfortable wins last night for their men at Norwich and their women at West Ham and Thomas Tuchel tried to put a brave face on it all by insisting it was “business as usual”. You can read all about the reaction here, Sean Ingle on what it all means here, and there’s a must-read from David Conn here on how the game turned a blind eye for years on the source of Abramovich’s wealth and power. And wouldn’t you know it, Chelsea’s opponents this weekend are Newcastle, who in a more ethically and properly regulated game wouldn’t have the owners they currently do either. Ah, the beautiful game.  On the field, there are only three Premier League matches on Saturday, with a relegation battle between Brentford and Burnley and a top-four tussle between Manchester United and Tottenham the picks. And we’ll have press conferences from Liverpool, Everton, Manchester United and Arsenal during the course of the day.

Photograph: iStock The Dublin International Piano Competition’s decision to ban Russian competitors has been criticised by many musicians.The prestigious competition has excluded nine Russian pianists because of the war in Ukraine out of the 65 originally scheduled to take part. In an email sent to Russian applicants, the organisers stated that it would be unable to include them in this year’s competition because of the invasion. “We appreciate the efforts and commitment of every hopeful competitor. We hope that shared cultural values will help to once again bring the world together peacefully in the future,” they said. The nine competitors excluded, according to the website thepianoleague, are Sergey Belyavskiy, Arseniy Gusev, Maxim Kinasov, Roman Kosyakov, Arsenii Mun, Ilya Shmukler, Vitaly Starikov, Arseny Tarasevich-Nikolaev and Dmitry Yudin. The 12th Dublin International Piano Competition will take place from May 17th-24th with the quarter finals and semi-finals scheduled for the TU Dublin Conservatoire, Grangegorman. The final will take place in the National Concert Hall at Earlsfort Terrace. The first prize is €15,000 but the competition’s main purpose is to help pianists launch successful careers internationally as musicians. In a statement the competition organisers said they understood that many musicians do not support the war, “but in light of Russia’s actions, we will be unable to include competitors from Russia in the 2022 competition”.The decision has not gone down well with some of the excluded musicians. Roman Kosyakov wrote on his Instagram page: “I’m just curious, how will this help to stop the war.”Arsenii Mun, another Russian pianist excluded from the competition after having been selected, said he is committed as a musician to bring “peace and joy” through his music.Writing on his Facebook page, he added: “And I hope that people will understand that I and most of my musical colleagues and friends from Russia are against war and aggression. “It is so sad to see how concert organizations are canceling concerts and competitions are banning Russian musicians who actually never publicly supported government and moreover made statements against the war!!! “People should know, being from Russia does NOT mean that we are taking part in such decisions!”London-based cellist Julia Morneweg said the decision of festivals like Dublin to exclude Russian performers was a form of suffering visited on Russian people who do not support the war. She wrote on her Instagram page: “The torment and pain – physical, visceral pain – I see not only Yuri, but all our close Russian friends go through, is heartbreaking.“Unfortunately none of this is helped by a few arts organisations who have decided that the best way to show their solidarity with Ukraine would be to exclude Russian artists or Russian music. “To be clear: I am not talking about the Gergievs, Netrebkos and Matsuevs of this world, but incredibly hard-working and decent musicians who abhor Putin with every fibre of their being and who, in many cases, left Russia precisely because of the political climate there. “There is NO excuse for this. Music is not like sport – we don’t go on stage as representatives of the country we happened to be born in. We move across borders and continents to become the best artists we can be.”Critics of the decision have also pointed to the example of the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition which takes place in Fort Worth, Texas, in June. It said it did not regard the Russian pianists taking part as “officials of their government, nor is their participation in the Cliburn state-sponsored. “Therefore, in the vision of our namesake and inspiration, Van Cliburn, and our mandate to support young artists – which is the very core of our mission – the Russian-born pianists will be allowed to audition for the Cliburn Competition.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland

contraceptive pill to solve the city’s growing pest problem.City hall bosses have ruled out more drastic action like a cull or mass sterilisation on animal welfare grounds.  A trial in one city square showed dispensing contraceptive corn pellets reduced the pigeon population by half in 10 months and 63 per cent over two years.The method is used in nearby Leuven, where it has cut numbers more than 50 per cent in just 18 months, and other European capitals like Barcelona.  Electronic dispensers give out contraceptive coated food at a set time every morning when the most dominant birds are active.The maize pellets are treated with an anti-parasite drug called R12, which has the side effect of preventing the eggs from developing.Roxanne Abels, an animal welfare advisor for the City of Brussels, said: “We’re not going to be able to put one on every street corner, they’re going to be placed at the points with the most complaints.”‘Flying rats’Residents have repeatedly complained hordes of “flying rats” are a blight on neighbourhoods, whilst their acidic droppings endanger national monuments.Pigeon poo corrodes even hard surfaces like marble, stone, and concrete. Each bird drops 12kg a year and creates an annual £13-£19 of clean up and repair costs.  Guano also presents a threat to human health and can spread diseases including the fungal infection cryptococcosis, which has meningitis-like symptoms.There are thought to be 5,000 nesting pairs in Brussels that breed all year round, producing a dozen young every 12 months. Chicks quickly reach sexual maturity.It was commonplace for irate locals to catch and kill the birds, but doing so was outlawed by the Belgian parliament last month.There is also a ban on feeding pigeons with fines of almost £300, but the rule is widely disobeyed and police are often reluctant to enforce it.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian fighter jets fire at ally Belarus in \u0026#39false flag attack\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Ukrainian soldiers hide in trenches as Russia escalates its air campaignFriday evening UK news briefing: Putin plan\u0026#39s \u0026#39terror attack\u0026#39 as jets fire on ally BelarusThe Ukraine crisis has humiliated the EURussia-Ukraine war: Listen to our daily podcastYoung Russians ‘crushed by what has been done in their name’, says Church of England priest in MoscowMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"even now eu cant help chastise hungary","story":"The wheels turn slowly in the European Parliament, but one finally turned this week when they voted to launch “rule of law” proceedings against Hungary and Poland.

Again and again, the EU has launched investigations and come up with little to nothing. Let us look at their supposed arguments. It\u0027s a recurring fantasy for the Left and the Left-leaning media that there is no independent media in Hungary, or that it’s being muffled. If you go into any newsagent in Budapest, you’ll see that at least half the titles have it in for Orbán, and even those that aren’t inherently hostile, like the best-selling tabloid Blikk, are quite prepared to harry and embarrass him if they scent a good story.Is there low-level corruption in Hungary? Are EU funds being misused? I’m sure all that is happening, but please tell me which EU country does not have the same problems? Hungary is constantly judged by a double standard, the belief that there is something fundamentally off in the country. The reality is that Orbán’s biggest transgression in their eyes is being a successful Right-wing politician.The Hungarian prime minister has been frequently described as “Putin’s ally” (again another idea promoted by the Hungarian opposition and swallowed hook, line and sinker by much of the media). Why? Because he did business with Putin. That is, Orbán did business with Putin in those rare moments when he could squeeze through the crowds of Germans, Brits and Americans vying for Russian cash and gas. If anyone merits the title of Putin’s sidekick it is Germany, which until a few weeks ago could barely bring itself to send a few thousand helmets to Ukraine.There is a comic irony that Germany has been the chief appeasers of Putin. Angela Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, who speaks Russian, should have known better than anyone else that she was dealing with a hardcore KGB thug. Chechnya, Syria, the Crimea, the shooting down of a civilian airliner: the Germans, the EU, the West did little in response to Putin’s butchery, but now it is Orbán who is Putin’s ally. The war in the Ukraine will cause massive economic pain in Hungary, which along with Poland is carrying the vast share of Europe\u0027s burden when it comes to the refugee crisis. In the short term at least, the constant sniping from the opposition that he is a ruthless strongman will probably only help Orbán, and if he can clear the hurdle of the upcoming election in April, he will be able to fight whatever the European Parliament comes up with.More from NewsJoe Biden personally vetoed plan to send Polish MiG fighter jets to UkraineRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian fighter jets fire at ally Belarus in \u0026#39false flag attack\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Ukrainian soldiers hide in trenches as Russia escalates its air campaignFriday evening UK news briefing: Putin plan\u0026#39s \u0026#39terror attack\u0026#39 as jets fire on ally BelarusThe Ukraine crisis has humiliated the EUDropping mad!

But how likely is it?Scientifically, it is certainly possible. In 2019, Cambridge University’s Centre for the Study of Existential Risk warned that biological weapons could be built targeting iniduals of a distinct ethnic group based on their DNA. Indeed, it is likely Russia knows this because it has been developing similar weapons itself, at least in the past. When Boris Yeltsin visited the UK in 1992, he told members of the UK\u0027s Defence Intelligence Staff that Russian bioweapon scientists had undertaken research into the influence of substances on human genes. In an interview in 1998, Dr Christopher Davis, who served on the UK’s DIS between 1987 and 1996, said the research opened the door to a weapon that could be sprayed indiscriminately yet only killed certain people it was designed to find and attack.‘Serious risks’Last year, the US accused Russia of continuing its bioweapons work in breach of the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention and 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned biowarfare and ordered the destruction of all agents. In retaliation, Russia and China issued a joint statement in October claiming the US operates 200 opaque and non-transparent biological laboratories outside US territory, which pose serious risks to Russian and Chinese national security.It is not unprecedented for the US to be working on ethically-questionable projects. As late as the 1960s, the US Army performed tests spraying US ships with biological and chemical warfare agents while military personnel were on board. Even in the last decade, US labs were working with Chinese scientists on gain of function research to enhance viruses, in experiments funded by the National Institutes of Health. But experts say there is little evidence to support the latest Russian claims about Ukraine - and say they come amid ongoing accusations that the US is establishing a chain of bio-labs on Russia’s borders. Dr Filippa Lentzos, co-director of the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King’s College London, debunked similar claims that the Russians made about a lab in Tbilisi, Georgia in 2020.“These claims have no merit and are part of a Russian disinformation campaign, supported by China,” she told The .“The pathogens stored at biological labs are not blueprints or components of biological weapons, they are simply bacteria and viruses. And there are no bacteria or viruses in Ukraine that the Russians don’t already have access to from their own labs. “There are no indications that Ukrainian labs have been involved in any nefarious activity or any research or development in contravention of the Biological Weapons Convention.“One possibility is that Russian forces may \u0027find evidence’ when they take over the labs to support their disinformation campaign.”The Ministry of Defence agreed that the accusations were not new, but warned there had been a noticeable uptick recently.“These narratives are long-standing but are currently likely being amplified as part of a retrospective justification for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” said a spokesman. Although Russia’s claims are usually ignored, this time they are feeding into already-established online conspiracies, and so are gaining traction. Pro-Donald Trump communities which have grown up around the alleged Pentagon whistleblower QAnon, already believe the US establishment has ill-intent and have long-viewed Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, as an ally against the cabal. ‘Ethnic-specific weapons’The KGB used to plant disinformation in foreign publications to sow seeds of discord, but now have an easier means of dispersal via internet message boards.Yet amid the mire of disinformation, there are still grounds for concern. Although labs may not be making bioweapons intentionally, there are legitimate fears about so-called dual use research, which despite good intentions could be hijacked for nefarious purposes. One theory about the Covid-19 pandemic is that the virus leaked from a laboratory where scientists were attempting to develop a universal vaccine for dangerous bat-borne coronaviruses. Experts say that the fast pace of global science is making it harder for countries to strike a balance between technological advances and dangerous biological research.The global collection of genetic data in the last decade has also played into the hands of those seeking to create ethnic-specific weapons. Unlike nuclear programmes, it is also far easier to hide chemical weapon experiments as they tend to use materials that are indistinguishable from normal lab use. So although Russia’s claims are undoubtedly baseless, there is a growing issue of bioweapons that needs to be addressed before it is too late.More from NewsFriday evening UK news briefing: Putin plan\u0026#39s \u0026#39terror attack\u0026#39 as jets fire on ally BelarusThe Ukraine crisis has humiliated the EURussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian fighter jets fire at ally Belarus in \u0026#39false flag attack\u0026#39Dropping mad!

His brutal and ill-conceived war in Ukraine, a personal crusade he has foisted on his country, has left his army mired abroad and an economy reeling under unprecedented Western sanctions at home. For 22 years he was the one constant of Russian politics, but no wonder people are thinking much more sharply not only about a Russia after Putin, but how that may be brought about.After all, who would have thought that a country so deeply embedded in the global economic system could so quickly be disconnected from so much of it? That a country with notionally more than half a trillion pounds in its foreign reserves would be debating emergency price regulation for medicines, basic foods and baby products. That a military machine in which Putin has invested so much for so long could stumble and fall as soon as it steps into neighbouring Ukraine.Indeed, on Monday, Putin, the man who four days before had vowed to destroy “this ‘Anti-Russia’ created by the West”, signalled that he was willing to cut his losses. The terms he offered Kyiv were still unrealistic and unacceptable, but having previously indicated that he wanted to take the whole country – to, as he put it, “denazify” it – now he is only seeking Crimea and the south-eastern Donbas region. Of course, at the same time he is escalating the brutality of the onslaught, hoping to negotiate from a position of strength, having taken more cities. However, it reflects the way that even this most out-of-touch of leaders is aware that this debacle threatens him and his regime. In a system which has become so personalised and authoritarian, though, the usual mechanisms for the transfer of power do not apply. It may therefore be more out of hope than anything else that there are those in Russia and beyond wondering if mortality will do the job. Rumours are multiplying. Might his strange terror of infection – never mind those comically long tables, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro apparently had to take five Covid tests to be able to shake his hand – be a sign he is suffering from a disease weakening his immune system? Footage of a trembling hand might indicate Parkinson’s. The puffiness of his face could be a sign of steroid treatment. Illness or a sense of impending mortality might help explain his splenetic new moods, and why a leader who in the past was much more cautious than his macho persona would suggest, now seems to be an angry old man in a hurry. Barring any such deus ex machina, it is hard to see him standing down voluntarily. He periodically toyed with handing the presidency to a successor, perhaps retaining some “father of the nation” role. However, in a system where politics trumps law, that means putting yourself at another’s mercy, and Putin is not a man who trusts easily at the best of times. Besides, he is clearly obsessed with his place in history – he could only step down on a high, and it is hard to see any triumphs in his future. In theory, Putin could be removed through the constitution. Article 93 allows for impeachment on the basis of serious crimes. Yet that requires not only a two-thirds vote in both chambers of parliament, but also the consent of the Constitutional and Supreme Courts. All have been packed with loyalists, and even if these opportunists thought that they were being led to destruction, it is almost impossible to see any kind of conspiracy being organised without it coming to the Kremlin’s attention. After all, not only is the much-feared Federal Security Service (FSB) tasked with watching the elite, but so too is the more secretive Federal Protection Service (FSO). Better known for the colourfully-uniformed Kremlin guards and Putin’s black-suited and earpiece-wearing personal security detail, every morning the FSO submits to the president a dossier on what is going on within the elite, based on agents, informants and phone taps. It must make for interesting reading, these days.The most extreme option some in the West are openly discussing is the prospect of outright assassination. This is highly unlikely, not least because the security precautions around “the Body”, as Putin is known by his security detail, are massive, complex and comprehensive to the point of paranoia. He rarely travels much these days anyway, except between his palaces and the Kremlin, and then in the presidential aircraft or an armoured Aurus Kortezh limo escorted by a huge motorcade with motorcycle outriders, vans full of heavily-armed FSO officers, an ambulance and an electronic warfare vehicle to jam any bomb detonators along the route and ert drones. Like a medieval monarch, he retains a food taster, and even the air in his palaces is constantly monitored for pathogens and poisons.Tsar Nicholas II was infamously murdered by the Bolsheviks, but only after they had seized him and his family. The last Russian ruler who fell to an assassin was Tsar Alexander II, over 140 years ago and the FSO has no intention of letting any re-runs happen on their watch. Where precision is impossible, what about brute force? It is a mark of the times that rumours – seemingly wholly fanciful – have been circulating that defence minister Sergei Shoigu is under suspicion of planning a coup. Certainly the only institutions which would seem able to oust Putin in a coup would be either the security agencies or, more plausibly, the army. The military have two elite isions outside Moscow, the 4th Guards “Kantemirovskaya” Tank Division and the 2nd Guards “Tamanskaya” Mechanised Division, as well as two Spetsnaz special forces units close by. However, not only are they carefully watched by the FSB’s military counter-intelligence department, one of whose primary roles is to sniff out potential disloyalty, but they also face a series of other units in Moscow. The National Guard, a parallel internal security army under former Putin bodyguard and arch-loyalist Viktor Zolotov has the oversized 1st Independent Special Designation Division based in the east of the city. They have their own tanks, artillery and anti-tank missiles, making it pretty clear that their role is, if necessary, to take on the military.Meanwhile, if that were not enough, the FSO’s Kremlin Regiment may be better known for the ramrod-stiff soldiers standing watch over the Eternal Flame just outside the fortress’s walls, but in crisis would exchange their pretty red-and-blue uniforms and ceremonial bolt-action rifles for camouflage and AK-74 assault rifles. There are 5,500 of them, hand-picked for their loyalty as much as their martial skills. In short, any attempt by the military alone to seize power and topple Putin could be a dangerous and messy venture, potentially leading to open warfare in Moscow’s streets.If mortality, muscle or machination do see Putin leave power, though, who might succeed him? It would probably be a technocrat, a strongman or a proxy.The constitution says that the prime minister steps in first as interim president before elections are held. Current incumbent Mikhail Mishustin is a former head of the Federal Tax Service. He has been in office since January 2020, and so his tenure has been under the shadow of Covid. Nonetheless, unlike his predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev, he has already managed to create the image of the no-nonsense and hard-headed manager. He also has just enough of a personal life to give the spin doctors something to craft a narrative around him. He plays ice hockey and the piano and has even written songs for Grigory Leps, a gravelly-voiced pop star sanctioned by the US government for alleged mafia connections.The 56-year-old Mishustin could be the obvious choice for a technocratic successor, but he has not yet been at the centre of power long enough to build himself a network of clients and allies. Other figures such as Moscow’s well-regarded mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, might also be in with a chance. More to the point, it would be hard to see a managerial candidate actually being able to bring down Putin. Their chance would only come if someone or something else opened the door for them.Someone like defence minister Shoigu might actually be able to kick that door open for himself. He is not by background a military man. He was a civil engineer who then became the emergencies minister in the 1990s, a job which for many would have been the kiss of death, making him responsible for every natural or man-made disaster in that unruly decade. Yet he made a virtue of necessity and his willingness to roll up his sleeves and get involved in anything, from comforting relatives to digging through rubble, actually made him a national figure.Shoigu also made the emergencies ministry, originally a dysfunctional a collection of agencies, one of the most efficient, trusted and even honest government departments in Russia. Appointed to head a ided and disgruntled defence ministry in 2012, Shoigu again was able to push forward reform and win the loyalty of soldiers and generals alike. This is, after all, a man with a unique political touch. Not only is he the only figure to make his way into Putin’s inner circle without having been a long-term friend from the KGB or Putin’s time in St Petersburg, he has also managed to rise within the carnivorous world of Russian politics without apparently making blood enemies on the way. Shoigu might be the kind of savvy strongman at once able to wield the muscle to topple Putin and also the political skills to reassure the rest of the elite. Other key figures within the security apparatus, such as FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov or National Guard commander Zolotov, are too closely linked to Putin and too mistrusted to be credible candidates.For all his current role in the Ukraine war, Shoigu appears to be a pragmatic kind of nationalist. Pervasive rumours suggest he was the only member of Putin’s inner circle not to support the annexation of Crimea in 2014. However, if experience of other coups is anything to go by, it is often the case that the initiator does not get to enjoy power long term. It may be that the 66-year-old Shoigu would simply be a transitional figure, who sweeps away the worst of Putinism, and sets the scene for the next generation of leaders.In theory, that could include the 56-year-old Medvedev, the only modern Russian politician to have been both prime minister and president. He was only president as Putin’s front man and chair-warmer, though, for the period 2008-12, while his boss governed from the prime minister’s office as a way to get round term limits. He does not strike an impressive figure, though. Of late, Medvedev, who holds an honorific but essentially meaningless position as deputy chairman of the Security Council, has been trying to reinvent himself as a hawk, taking extreme positions on everything from the death penalty to seizing the assets of companies leaving Russia. Nonetheless, he is now something of a laughing stock. In 2016, opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s followers starting using yellow rubber ducks as a light-hearted symbol of protest after he revealed that Medvedev’s “summer house” was actually a sumptuously-renovated 18th-century palace with an extravagant duck house on a lake.Medvedev could conceivably be president again, but only as a proxy, if a collection of powerful figures – none powerful enough to seize the presidency for themselves – want a front man they do not have to fear.In any case, whoever succeeds Putin is likely to have to be a different and even transitional figure, shaped not just by the hard times facing Russia but also the rising political generation. Putin is 69, and most of his close allies are the same age or older. They are in many ways the last of the true Soviet elite.Beneath them, increasingly impatient at an older generation that still seems intent on replaying the Cold War, and squandering their future in the process, is a rather different cohort of officials and businesspeople in their 50s and early 60s. They are by no means democrats, and can be every bit as hard-nosed as their seniors. However, in my experience at least, they lack the venomous and vindictive passion for Russia’s struggle with the West evident in Putin and people like his Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev and the FSB’s Bortnikov, both 70 years old.This younger generation is made up of, to be blunt, pragmatic kleptocrats. They hanker after the good old days of the 2000s, when they were free to embezzle at home on an industrial scale, yet spend and bank that money in the West without fear of sanctions, asset freezes and Swift bans. They may not dare to turn against Putin now, as their fortunes and freedom are in his hands, but they are unlikely to want to continue his crusade against the West if they can possibly avoid it.All of which is why the West must be careful and clever. With our screens darkened with terrible images of a maternity hospital shelled and Mariupol being starved into submission, it is only human that people have begun suggesting that something ought to be done to try to topple Putin’s regime or even remove him. This is understandable – but inadvisable.First of all, if you come at the tsar, you best not miss. Assassination or regime change by covert action have a pretty poor track record. The CIA came up with, or launched, 638 separate attempts to kill Cuba’s Fidel Castro, yet he still died of natural causes aged 90, after 52 years in power.Directly targeting Putin and failing would set a dangerous precedent and trigger retaliation. How would our MPs and senior civil servants enjoy having to check their door handles for Novichok every time they got home? Even a successful assassination would likely anger Russians from across the political spectrum and make it harder for a successor to roll back his aggressive policies and improve relations with the West.For moment, then, it looks as if both we and the Russians are stuck with Putin. But in war, things can change quickly. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 was meant to be a “nice, victorious little war” in the words of interior minister Vyacheslav von Plehve, to demonstrate Russia’s strength to the world and restore public morale. As it was, a dismal and embarrassing defeat sparked the unsuccessful 1905 revolution. Likewise, the economic crisis and horrifying losses Russia endured in the First World War led to growing unrest that drove the elite to force the tsar to abdicate. The Soviet war in Afghanistan of 1979-89, a war the Kremlin at first tried to pretend wasn’t even happening, didn’t bring down the regime but did become a metaphor for all the other things wrong with an economically-stagnant, mismanaged and corrupt regime.Already, critical voices are even being heard on TV programmes that usually deliver nothing less than undiluted state propaganda. Guests on the primetime show hosted by Vladimir Solovyov, sanctioned for his role as a Kremlin mouthpiece, drew direct comparisons with Afghanistan and warned that public opinion could quickly change. Meanwhile, on the army’s own TV channel, Zvezda, a serving officer, pushed home the scale of casualties. In both cases, the naysayers were shouted down – the Zvezda presenter insisted that “our guys are smashing the fascist snakes” – but it is unprecedented for such views to be aired on state television, and a sign of the growing mood of dissatisfaction.History is no map of the future, but it does remind us of how war can change everything. It may seem almost inconceivable that Putin’s reign could end any day soon, but now he has made an all-out gamble on war in Ukraine, all bets are off.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian fighter jets fire at ally Belarus in \u0026#39false flag attack\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Ukrainian soldiers hide in trenches as Russia escalates its air campaignFriday evening UK news briefing: Putin plan\u0026#39s \u0026#39terror attack\u0026#39 as jets fire on ally BelarusThe Ukraine crisis has humiliated the EUDropping mad!

Heavily pregnant women, and new mothers clutching babies, were escorted from the blackened ruins of a maternity hospital in Mariupol that had been destroyed by an airstrike, in which three people were killed. They were the sort of unforgettable photographs that can come to define a war. Proof, if it were needed, that Russia is waging war not on the army, but on Ukraine itself.One woman was apparently unmoved, however: Maria Zakharova, director of the information and press department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Putin’s inscrutable spokesman. Asked about the attack in a press briefing, she went on the offensive. “This is information terrorism,” she said, claiming that Ukrainian reports about the airstrike were fake. This followed her earlier claims that Ukraine was developing biological weapons.To the unfamiliar, Zakharova’s sinister tone might seem shocking, but there is nothing new about it. She is merely the most prominent soldier in a clone army of media savvy Russian women who have taken on the job of lying for the Putin regime. They do it in fluent English, with apparent relish, and there are seemingly no depths to which they will not stoop. It may still be men driving the tanks and jumping out of planes. But in the new propaganda war, Putin’s elite shock troops are women. In a country that was used to government press briefings being conducted by dry men in drab suits, these women, with their swashbuckling style and salty jokes, as well as bright lipstick, big hair and sharp outfits, have been a breath of fresh air. Zakharova’s briefings have become must-watch events, amassing millions of views on YouTube.  A mixture of steel and showbiz has turned these women into celebrities. Who cares if they are doing the devil’s work?Yet Putin is far from the only authoritarian world leader to have employed smart women to help with his messaging. Between 2017 and 2020, Donald Trump used his political adviser Kellyanne Conway to similar effect, often via Fox News. It was Conway who defended then-press secretary Sean Spicer’s use of “alternative facts,” and who invented a fictitious atrocity, the Bowling Green Massacre, to defend the president’s immigration ban. For decades before she retired, the North Korean newsreader Ri Chun-hee, sometimes called the “Pink Lady” for her brightly coloured outfits, delivered national news – about nuclear developments or the ongoing success of the leadership – in stern, sometimes melodramatic tones. “I don’t know if Putin and these other leaders are deliberately choosing women, or if it’s simply that they are the best people for the job,” says Jo Tanner, a communications consultant and former adviser to Boris Johnson. “Possibly there’s a macho element in these male leaders choosing female spokeswomen. “I can see the logic of putting up a woman to defend an attack on a maternity hospital. You would be trying to take away the hard edges. But Zakharova is pretty robust in her delivery.” So much so that she, along with Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of broadcaster RT (formerly Russia Today), have been put on the EU sanctions list alongside oligarchs – Zakharova for having “promoted the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine”.Simonyan first came to attention in the UK in 2018 when she conducted the bizarre interview with the Salisbury Novichok poisoners, in which they claimed to be a friendly gay couple who had simply visited the town in order to see the cathedral’s “famous 123m spire”.  When she was asked how she felt about being sanctioned by the EU, she replied sarcastically, “Maria Zakharova and I took out handkerchiefs,” in order to “have a little cry.” Then there is Maria Butina, who was convicted of spying for Russia against the US in 2018, and now serves in the State Duma. On Wednesday, in a Today interview with Nick Robinson that sent marmalade spiralling from spoons all over Britain, she claimed that Ukrainians were shelling themselves. Nor should we forget Anna Chapman, the flame haired former spy, who found time this week to come out in support of the war, in between flogging children’s clothes on Instagram. Senator and government spokesman Valentina Matviyenko, meanwhile, claims that the invasion was the “only way to stop a brotherly war”. Jo Tanner says it’s a moot point whether these women are party to their own lies. “Internally, these spokespeople are playing on the fact that their own people have limited access to other sources of information,” she says. “The whole invasion is based on a complete lie, and is being fuelled by a continuation of that. You would hope that the spokespeople are being duped and they don’t know the truth when they’re delivering it. But you have to question that. They are cultured people doing these jobs. They must be able to see the other sources of information around the world, contradicting what they are saying.” Although Putin’s female mouthpieces have come up via different routes, they have in common conservative views and a history of unswerving loyalty to the chief. Simonyan was a Kremlin reporter, cutting her teeth during the Chechen War before being made editor of Russia Today when she was just 25. “She has a strong journalistic background,” says Emily Ferris, a research fellow at Rusi, a think tank, who specialises in Russia and Eurasia. “She was part of the Kremlin press pack. She proved that she was someone who could be trusted.” Butina was an assistant for Aleksandr Torshin, a Putin ally, who was sent to infiltrate American institutions, including the NRA, in the run-up to the 2016 election. Matviyenko is a longtime Putin loyalist, something which helped her become the first female leader of St Petersburg.Perhaps the most interesting is Zakharova, with the CV that could have taken her anywhere. Her mother was an art historian and her father was Russia’s ambassador to Beijing, where the family lived for 10 years, as a result of which Zakharova speaks fluent Chinese. She has the Russian equivalent of a PhD. “Zakharova is particularly aggressive against the West, which I think some Russians might view as a display of strength” says Ferris. “But Russia is still a pretty misogynistic country, and she also counters a lot of traditional visions of how women should be. I wouldn’t say I admire her, exactly, but it’s very difficult to be a woman in that role.” Sometimes called Putin’s “troll-in-chief”, Zakharova has built a reputation as one of the Russian president’s most combative outriders, unafraid to take the fight to the press. At one notorious briefing in 2018, she confronted a Finnish journalist who had dared to ask about an anti-LGBT campaign being prosecuted in Chechnya by its leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. Stepping out from behind her lectern, Zakharova suggested that the journalist might go and see for himself. “You’re not afraid, are you?” she said. “We’re not joking.” Then she winked. “It was very awkward and uncomfortable,” Erkka Mikkonen told reporters afterwards. “It was like getting called out by the teacher in school. She was trying to make me feel like an idiot.”“She really likes her job she gets a kick out of what she does,” Aleksey Maslov, an economics professor who taught Zakharova in the early Noughties, told Buzzfeed. “She has turned PR management for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs into high theatre.” “Partly these roles have ended up being filled by women because they are less prestigious than the big internal jobs,” says Mark Galeotti, a professor at UCL who specialises in Russia. “But there’s also an awareness that a succession of dull apparatchiks in grey suits didn’t work at punching up the message. Whereas the Zakharovas of the world absolutely get the coverage and the attention. It’s Ann Coulter syndrome.  “Their roles mean that a lot of these women are more famous outside of Russia than at home,” he says. “Butina was a kind of accidental celebrity. Simonyan is a shrewd careerist, with an eye for what will catch people’s attention. It’s hard to know what she believes in her heart of hearts, but at a certain point you make your choices. “Zakharova is probably a different case. She enjoys the combative nature of her job. My sense is that she absolutely believes what she’s saying.” These women are also proof that for a certain kind of ambitious young woman, the Kremlin can offer a path to the top faster than the private sector. “It’s not equal opportunities, exactly,” says Galeotti. “But the Kremlin is interested in tapping whatever human resources it has. Leave your morals at the door, and it helps if you’re attractive.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian fighter jets fire at ally Belarus in \u0026#39false flag attack\u0026#39Latest pictures from Ukraine: Ukrainian soldiers hide in trenches as Russia escalates its air campaignFriday evening UK news briefing: Putin plan\u0026#39s \u0026#39terror attack\u0026#39 as jets fire on ally BelarusThe Ukraine crisis has humiliated the EUDropping mad!

We Have No Bananas” became the unofficial theme tune for rationing during the Second World War when the Ministry of Food banned the import of the fruit to save ships.But now scientists have found a way to make sure bananas remain on grocery shelves.Cambridge University has discovered how to graft species of banana together to transfer beneficial characteristics, such as disease resistance - a task which was believed impossible before now “I read back over decades of research papers on grafting and everybody said that it couldn’t be done,” said Dr Greg Reeves, a Gates Cambridge Scholar in the University of Cambridge Department of Plant Sciences, and first author of the paper.“I was stubborn enough to keep going - for years - until I proved them wrong.”The breakthrough comes at a crucial time when banana plantations are under threat from soil-borne pathogens including Panama disease which has been destroying drops for over 30 years.A recent acceleration in the spread of this disease has prompted fears of global banana shortages.Single variety vulnerable to diseaseThe world’s banana industry is based on a single variety, called the Cavendish banana - a clone that can withstand long-distance transportation, but has no genetic ersity making it vulnerable to disease. Cavendish bananas are also sterile so disease resistance cannot be bred into future generations of the plant. Until now it was thought impossible to graft grass-like plants in the group known as monocotyledons because they lack a specific tissue type, called the vascular cambium, in their stem.But scientists have found that when tissue is still embryonic in seeds, it can fuse sufficiently with a different species, allowing for grafting. It means that species can be combined without the need for genetic modification. “We’ve achieved something that everyone said was impossible, said Professor Julian Hibberd in the University of Cambridge’s Department of Plant Sciences, senior author of the report.“We found that even distantly related species, separated by deep evolutionary time, are graft compatible.Grafting embryonic tissue holds real potential across a range of grass-like species.Technique transferrable to other plants There are an estimated 60,000 plants that are monocotyledons, including food staples like rice, wheat and barley. Being able to add helpful traits could bring huge benefits to the food industry. The team has also shown it works in pineapple, onion, tequila agave and date palm by injecting fluorescent dye into the plant roots – from where it was seen to move up the plant and across the graft junction.“It’s an urgent challenge to make important food crops resistant to the diseases that are destroying them,” added Dr Reeves.“Our technique allows us to add disease resistance, or other beneficial properties like salt-tolerance, to grass-like plants without resorting to genetic modification or lengthy breeding programmes.”The researchers have filed a patent for their grafting technique through Cambridge Enterprise. “Panama disease is a huge problem threatening bananas across the world. It’s fantastic that the University of Cambridge has the opportunity to play a role in saving such an important food crop,” said Dr Louise Sutherland, Director Ceres Agri-Tech, a collaboration between Cambridge, four other universities and three agricultural research institutes.The research was published in the journal Nature.More from NewsLatest pictures from Ukraine: Ukrainian soldiers hide in trenches as Russia escalates its air campaignFriday evening UK news briefing: Putin plan\u0026#39s \u0026#39terror attack\u0026#39 as jets fire on ally BelarusThe Ukraine crisis has humiliated the EURussia-Ukraine latest news: Russian fighter jets fire at ally Belarus in \u0026#39false flag attack\u0026#39Dropping mad!

Brendan Wyatt, who owns Liverpool clothing store Transalpino, had no experience of the aid industry, but after seeing the harrowing scenes of fleeing women and children, and our ­government’s pitul response to it, he couldn’t just sit back and watch. He left last weekend with his mate Robin Grime and Rado Chmiel, a Pole living in Liverpool, as interpreter. When they reached Rzeszow close to the Ukraine border, they went to a Macro store and filled a hired van full of food, blankets, nappies, sanitary towels, kids’ shoes and toys bought with the £, they had raised en route.  They then drove to a refuge centre and handed the much-needed supplies over to  grateful and humbled women and children. When I asked Brendan why he made the trip, he answered “because I could”. He is just one of countless British citizens, moved by the haunting plight of desperate Ukrainians, doing their bit to help, whether giving money, volunteering with charities or heading there to fight. But while we’re witnessing sacrice, generosity and action from below, at the top we’re seeing coldness, indference and mental torture by bureaucracy. Krzysztof Mikucki, a builder who drove from Mansfield to the Romanian border to pick up his Ukrainian we and her mother, and drive them back to safety in Britain, was one of hundreds held up for hours by UK Border Force staff at Calais and eventually told to go to Brussels or Paris to apply for a visa. “They treated us worse than the water in the toilet,” he said, angrily.  Refugees who have tried to come here to escape Putin’s genocide speak of our government treating them like criminals. And sadly they are spot-on. Because the Home Office’s lamentable excuse for not acting in the same humane manner as virtually every other European nation and greeting them with open arms is that we have to be sure these people are not spies or terrorists. Even though they are distraught women and children who have been battered out of their homes and are now battered with red tape to keep them out of the UK.How did we reach the point where the greeting from a once-compassionate country to ­families ­travelling , miles to fleethe worst nightmare imaginable is a taped-up piece of A paper on a Calais hostel window sending them back  miles to Paris or ­Brussels How was there no one in authority ­apologising and explaining what was going on, despite this ­effectively being the UK border with Europe   Meanwhile, in the Commons, the liar-in-chief and his immigrant-hating sidekicks shed ­crocodile tears and talk about Britain having an unparalleled tradition for welcoming refugees. Well we did before electing a government primarily on a ticket to shut our borders to outsiders. And whatever schemes they now come up with to distract from their initial response to the victims of Putin’s obscene war, these Tories have shamed Britain into looking small, insular, mean, nasty and cruel. Even though so many of its people are the polar opposite.

Days after the party fundraiser, on July , , the passenger jet Malaysia Airlines flight  was shot down by a surface to air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine.And just months earlier, Putin had faced international condemnation over the annexation of Crimea.But speaking to LBC Radio’s Andrew Marr today, the former PM insisted Mrs Chernukhin had attempted “absolutely no influence” on UK policies on Russia.Askedhe remembered the game, he said: “I do, I remember - and there was absolutely no conversation about Russia, finance, Putin or anything .”  “We had a very careful system for vetting who could and could not give money to the Conservative Party. “A small handful of people had any connections with Russia, and as I’m concerned most of them were dissidents, often Ukrainians.” Mrs Chernukhin was born in Russia, studied in the United States and became a British citizen in . She is legally eligible to vote and make donations to UK political parties, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on her part.Ms Chernukhin has repeatedly paid for access to successive Prime Ministers ministers in Party fundraising auctions, including a ‘girl’s night out’ with Theresa May and Liz Truss, dinner with then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and a second tennis match with Boris Johnson, after he became Prime Minister.In total Ms Chernukhin has given almost £ million to the Conservatives - and is the biggest female political donor in British history.Mr Cameron went on: “But crucially, this point - Britain had the strongest anti-Putin policy of any country in Europe. “Who threw him out of the G  Who insisted on the sanctions  Who passed the rules on beneficial ownership  “So I think it’s a giant red herring to suggest in some way that Russian money somehow influenced policy against Putin and Russia.” He added he was the “strongest ally in building a really robust case in holding Putin to account.”  Asked what Mrs Chernukhin and other Russian expat donors were paying for when they gave money to the party, he replied: “Like many people who come and live in this country and make it their home, they get involved in politics because they care about this country, and making sure it’s an open, tolerant and democratic country.” He said there was “absolutely no influence” on the UK’s Russia policies adding: “If they were trying to buy something, they didn’t really get it, did they ” On Tuesday evening, Mrs Chernukhin was given the Award of St Agnes, one of most prestigious honours handed out by the Republic of San Marino at a ceremony in London. The event was attended by a high-level government delegation from the micro-country, including Captains Regent Francesco Mussoni and Giacomo Simoncini, the dual heads of state. Tory MP Andrew Rossindell, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on San Marino, attended the event and gave a speech. And on Wednesday morning, the delegation met with Boris Johnson, which they described as “friendly”. Earlier Mr Cameron called Russian president Vladimir Putin a phenomenal liar. The Conservative told LBCaposs Tonight With Andrew Marr that when hosting the Russian president in No  in  Mr Putin let his guard down and said, aposFundamentally Iaposm not a democrat and I donapost share your interestsapos. Mr Cameron added: He was also a phenomenal liar. I remember confronting him with evidence that Russian troops were in the Donbas, he flat out lied, I remember confronting him with evidence about the shooting down of a Malaysia Airline - there was no naivety.

Campaigners accused the Department of Health and Social Careof witholding information for “news management purposes.”DHSC claimed it had taken a law-breaking  days to perform a ‘public interest test’ on whether to disclose the  word iMessage - nearly a week per word.The message saw a businessman tell a minister he was looking forward to a forthcoming meeting and wish him a “good night.”The message was eventually handed to the Mirror just hours after the Cabinet Office published its ‘terms of reference’ for the forthcoming public inquiry into Covid-. Tom Brake, chair of Unlock Democracy, said: “This is another example of the timing of FOI responses being used for news management purposes. “Even in the most bureaucratic of bureaucracies it is hard to see how it could take  months to review a  word text.” DHSC confirmed in July that communication records existed relating to meetings between former Health minister Lord Bethell, former Tory chair Lord Feldman and representatives of Meller Designs.It has since been revealed that Housing Secretary Michael Gove referred Meller Designs to the ‘fast lane’, while he was the minister in charge of Government Contracts.Meller Designs was handed a total of £ million worth of PPE contracts at the height of the pandemic.The firm was, until January , co-owned by David Meller, who helped to run Mr Goveaposs failed Tory leadership campaign in , has personally donated £, to Mr Gove and a total of £, to the Conservative Party. The Mirror has been pursuing the department to release records of communication between Mr Meller, Lord Bethell and Lord Feldman relating to the meeting. But officials claimed the material could be “commercially sensitive” and related to the “freedom to formulate policy”, so they needed more time to decide whether it would be possible to publish. Mr Brake said there was “not much evidence” that the text had “any bearing on ‘freedom to formulate policy’ and ‘commercial sensitivity’. The iMessage message from Mr Meller to Lord Bethell, sent at .pm on April , , saw the businessman thank him for a phone call that day, confirm the meeting the following day and wish him a good night.

He just doesnt know it yetThe only issue is how the rest of the world makes it clear, says Fleet Street FoxVladimir Putin - loseropinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsCast your mind back to the last time you played Monopoly with a sore loser. He - and itaposs always a he - insists on being banker. He declares your family tradition of stashing all the fines in Free Parking to be against the rules. His pile of cash and houses seems to grow every time someone goes to get another bag of crisps, or pops to the loo.Then one player he has driven to the brink of bankruptcy lands on Free Parking, and scoops the jackpot. The balance of the game swings away from the bully. He is found in breach of the rules himself. The others co-ordinate against him, and dad - itaposs always dad - gts his cash and assets to the person most likely to destroy the aggressor. When he buys hotels no-one visits, is jailed and unable to take rent, when the lie that he was All-England Monopoly Champion  is finally disproved, and he has been reduced to being little more than a tiny, pewter boot, he flips the board in a fury.  Weaposve all played with that guy. And picked up the pieces afterwards. We all know there was never any point in helping him to lose more gently so that he could save face. He needed to lose - and for everyone to know it.The wheels have been ripped off Vladimir Putinaposs unserviced trucks. The tanks have been immobile on the roads, and have now gone off-road to become immobile in the mud. Goliathaposs planes and helicopters have been shot down by Davidaposs surface-to-air missiles, and the children Putin sent to war have died in such numbers heaposs been forced to order up mercenaries and Bashar al Assadaposs surviving conscripts. Heaposs shut down the TV stations, lost his Big Macs, and destroyed the mobile phone masts which his own intelligence forces were using to communicate. His generals are dying on the frontline because they had to abandon the control room to get their orders followed. He restructured Russiaaposs economy to be based on energy extraction and supply, and half the worldaposs stopped buying it overnight. The only people choosing to be on his side are the thicker end of the Cha terraces.Nothing in those previous two paragraphs happens when youaposre winning. Andit happens in the space of two weeks, the board-flipping moment when Putin realises his own failure cannot be far off. But whataposs worrying the West is what heaposll do to distract from the loss. Will he mine or gas Ukraine as he retreats  Will he fire tactical, smaller nukes which will obliterate buildings, irradiate the concrete dust sucked into the fireball, and then allow microscopic, inhalable radioactive particles to fall gently along the routes of prevailing winds  Perhaps he will release any one of the deadly pathogens he holds within the worldaposs largest bioweapon stockpile.Thataposs why world leaders, analysts, and journalists talk about an off-ramp, giving the madman an exit where he can make a dignied withdrawal and save face. They want him to think he can keep his job and his billionsonly he de-escalates, and steps back from the brink.The problem with that is a madman in a tank doesnapost give a s*** about the rules of the road. The point at which he was sane enough to spot and take an exit route was waaaaaaaay back, before he lost his mind. If this guy saw an off-ramp now, heaposd bomb it.If Putin is capable of using unimaginably-bad weapons - and he is - then he is adrt from the reality he would need to have any instinct of self-preservation. The flipping of the board is as certain as the coup daposetat the oligarchs he created will stage to save their looted billions. The issue with both is not , but when. Read more If it happens soon, thousands and maybe millions of lives can be saved. The Russian economy can recover, and the world can help Ukraine pick up the pieces. To act against Putin, his deposer needs to be more realistic and practical than he is, which is why it would work in the worldaposs favour and is perhaps also why it hasnapost happened yet among the men he has manipulated and paid off for two decades.Thataposs the end-game the world and its leaders must seek, because Putin is past the point of saving his own face. He would happily saw it off himself, then threaten to do everybody aposs,you let him have so much as a butter kne.The world needs him to lose. To have no exit, and to know it. All despots must see what happensyou invade a sovereign nation, and that the Westaposs immense financial power, whether in the shape of official sanctions or a spontaneous customer boycott, is a weapon with no possible defence.Because he was always going to flip the board one day,you let him play. Giving him an off-ramp means heaposs still mad, and heaposs still got a tank. Letting him slice off a piece of Ukraine is like letting him go bankrupt, but keep a hotel on Mayfair. We should never have sat down with someone who has never obeyed, but only imposed, rules. We are counting the cost of making money while he picked on someone . But the only upside of playing a game with a sore loser is that, when he loses, he feels sorest. Economically throttling his cronies is the swtest, best and only weapon we can use, because they want to keep playing this game. Our best hope is that Putin realises heaposs lost when the board, and all the lives on it, are no longer within his reach.

These elite iniduals have a collective net worth of £ billion, the Foreign Office said in an official announcement. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. Todayaposs decision brings the total number of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by Britain to , with another five already on the list. Sanctions have also been imposed on Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and a number of Belarusian officials  Liz Truss said: Today’s sanctions show once again that oligarchs and kleptocrats have no place in our economy or society. With their close links to Putin they are complicit in his aggression.The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands. They should hang their heads in shame. Boris Johnson said: There can be no safe havens for those who have supported Putinaposs vicious assault on Ukraine. We will be ruthless in pursuing those who enable the killing of civilians, destruction of hospitals and illegal occupation of sovereign allies. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy said it was the right decision but it should not have taken the Government weeks. He said: Too few oligarchs linked to Putinaposs rogue regime have so far faced sanctions from the UK Government. We are lagging far behind allies in the EU and the US.It is right that, under pressure from Labour, the Government U-turned to strengthen sanctions legislation. Ministers must now move faster to continue to close the sanctions gap.Here are the new names added to the sanctions list. Roman Abramovich Roman Abramovich is one of the most high-profile Russian oligarchs in the UK thanks to his ownership of Cha Football Club. Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £. billion and has a multi-million pound property empire in the UK, also has stakes in steel giant Evraz and Norilsk Nickel, the UK Government said. He sold a % stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom for £. billion in . He recently announced plans to sell the top-flight football club, which he has owned since , after initially saying he was passing stewardship to the clubaposs charitable foundation. Abramovich has denied having strong ties with Putin but the Government said he had had received financial benefits from the Kremlin, including tax breaks for his companies, the buying and selling of shares from and to the state at favourable rates, and contacts in the run up to the  World Cup in Russia.The list shows he has been sanctioned both on the basis of his personal connections to the Kremlin and preferential contracts over the years, but also the role the Evraz steel company plays - the British government believe it is providing steel to the Russian military The football club has now been seized by the UK Government but ministers have issued a licence authorising Cha to continue playing matches. Season ticket holders and those with games already booked can still attend matches, but no new tickets can be sold and the clubaposs merchandise shop will close. Abramovich’s UK property will also be frozen with not even cleaners allowed to enter it. But the asset is still only “frozen” - not actually seized by the UK government. Technically the tycoon’s family - who are not directly targeted with sanctions - could stay in his homes but officials believe it would be practically very dficult. Oleg Deripaska Industrialist Oleg Deripaska, who is Abramovichaposs former business partner, was among those newly added to the sanctions list. The Russian tycoon has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world’s major aluminium producers. Deripaska is estimated to be worth £billion, with a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK.  He hit the headlines in  when he hosted Labour grandee Lord Peter Mandelson and then-shadow chancellor George Osborne on his yacht in Corfu. Mr Osborne was accused of trying to solicit a donation for the Tory party from the oligarch - something he denies. The US designated Deripaska in , which is means a personaposs assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. Igor Sechin Tycoon Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. The UK Government described him as a particularly close and influential ally of Putin and he is understood to be regarded as Putinaposs number two.  He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. The French Government seized a yacht linked to the oligarch last week. Andrey Kostin Andrey Kostin is the chairman of VTB bank, Russiaaposs second largest bank. The bank was designated by the UK last month. The UK put his net worth at an estimated £ million. Kostin was described by the FCDO as a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through the bank.  He has previously accused the West of waging economic war against Russia through sanctions. He has already been sanctioned by the US and EU. Alexei Miller The chief executive of Russian energy company Gazprom is one of the most important executives supporting the Kremlin. Miller served under Putin in the s when the now-President was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. UK officials believe he has been going along his career trajectory with Putin since the Russian President was was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in s.  Miller has already been sanctioned by the US. Nikolai Tokarev Nikolai Tokarev is president of the Russia state-owned pipeline company Transneft. He served alongside Putin in the KGB in Dresden, East Germany, in the s. They have remained closely associated ever since. Tokarev has been sanctioned by the US and EU. Dmitri Lebedev Dmitri Lebedev is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Bank Rossiya.

You had to pinch yourself to realise that until very recently our Prime Minister spent every appearance here refusing to admithe’d held parties in his own flat. Yet here was the leader of a major European country being brutally honest about the devastating shelling of flats by an invading army in cities three hours away from the UK on a budget flight.As Volodymyr Zelensky outlined the crimes being unleashed by a “gangster state” the assembled MPs, wearing headphones and grim expressions on the packed benches, gave the big, hushed room the feel of a war crimes court. Hopefully a modern-day Nuremberg awaits Zelensky’s nemesis, Putin. The Ukrainian leader pointed out he was addressing everyone in the UK, as a fellow citizen of the world. And dressed in his trademark green tee-shirt he looked the part. As he gave us a breakdown of the horrors happening in his homeland, with eyes heavy and face drawn, it could have been someone you’d just met talking you through a personal tragedy. If anything encapsulates the Spirit of Ukraine it is this man. If anything says Putin won’t win it is Zelensky’s defiant demeanour. His presence in our parliament, like his message, was simple. It said: “I’m not hiding, I’m not afraid. We will endure.” Other world leaders have addressed Westminster before such as Barack Obama and Angela Merkel. But whereas they felt like they were taking part in some mutual admiration ceremony, this felt real. It felt urgent.  Whenever we turn our TVs on we see voiceless children and pensioners scrambling for their lives, and here was their voice. Here was their living symbol of resistance. Here was a man telling us, from the heart, why we cannot further abandon those innocent civilians who do not deserve their plight. Yet who do deserve our protection. It made you ashamed of the listening government’s pathetic response to the refugee crisis, with the pitul amount of visas they’ve handed out and the bureaucratic hoops they are making desperate people jump through to get them. Zelensky is what we hope we would all be when put under the most intolerable of pressure. Cool and courageous. This former actor is suddenly making speeches on the hoof that the finest dramatists would be proud of. For his British audience he evoked Shakespeare, saying there was no question of whether Ukraine’s fate was “to be or not to be.” It was to be. He pushed the British patriotic buttons even harder when he summoned the spirit of Winston Churchill, vowing to fight the Russian enemy in the fields and in the forests. Johnson gave a knowing smile of recognition when he heard that. Priti Patel sat there smirking by his side throughout, as she does. And when Zelensky talked about dramatically increasing sanctions, Rishi Sunak’s eyebrows twitched as he did the sums.  To hear him speak is to realise how badly Putin underestimated the will of Ukrainians. It’s the sense of calm he projects that has kept his nation going in the face of horrendous oppression. At the end of his -minute speech, during a long standing ovation, some MPs wiped away tears. It was a moving performance which humbled all who watched and gave us hope. Because the longer Zelensky survives and the more he draws standing ovations from parliaments and wet cheeks from millions watching on TV, the more he becomes Putin’s worst nightmare.

Sharon Sutila, , is a mum-of-two with a sixth sense for when people are telling porkies - something she claims to have learned from raising -year-old Marissa and -year-old Tesla. Now the CEO of Cluso Investigation, which she founded in , Sharon puts her super sleuth skills to work uncovering secrets people would rather keep buried. Sharon, who describes herself as a human lie detector, says her kids donapost even bother lying to her anymore, as they know theyaposll get caught. The mum from the US state of Delaware said: My skillset means I stay as neutral as I can, evenI don’t trust what they are telling me. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here I don’t call them out, I try to stay cool and find outthey are telling me the truth, but I always find out. They are aware of that, so they have grown up knowing it is always better to tell the truth. If theyaposve ever told me they don’t have homework when they do, they know I will find out about it.She described an incident when Marissa was little and she tried to conceal a mark sheaposd made in the house from her mum. Sharon says she not only found out about the mark, but also went as far as showing her daughter the New York state laws to let her know lying has consequences. She said: I think it scared her to death!  The mum reckons she honed her detective skills when she was just  years old and channelled her favourite literary characters, Sherlock Holmes and Nancy Drew. After a classroom bully smashed her favourite record and wrote her a nasty note, Sharon was determined to expose them to her teacher. She found out who the culprit was by comparing their handwriting to the homework of her peers. After graduating from university in , Sharon shunned the family business in fishing and seafood to embark upon a career in tech for IBM. There, she realised she could use her coding skills to suss out new potential employees - and she pointed out those who werenapost telling the truth on their CVs.  People had put degrees that they had never taken and qualications that they never had, she said. And when her bosses discovered her skills, she became an integral part of the companyaposs international operation. Sharon said: I wanted to know more about the person, or I couldn’t be sure they weren’t lying to me. I absolutely love research, figuring things out and problem solving. I like challenges. Now working as a private investigator, Sharon says sheaposs skilled at finding out things about people from the comfort of her own home - as long as she has a computer. She said: I mostly work on allowing people to tell me what they want to tell me first. And I’ll try to seethey are being honest.  While Sharon enjoys her work, sheaposs had to put up with her fair share of threats from people who sheaposs exposed. She said: I have been threatened. A man told me he was going to come into my house. But I’m not going to let someone stop me from doing my job just because they are being aggressive. I’m not going to stop what I do because of a threat. Sharon has now penned a novel based on some of her experiences working in a male-dominated industry, called The Healing. She said: Championing equality for women is my lelong passion. Challenging gender bias and the stereotyping of women is critically important to combat the issue. I wrote my book by starting my character with a lot of my own background. I grew up in the same time frame as the book and went through the very same gender norms, which can mean women canapost do or achieve certain things. In the book, the character starts in the same way I did - being told I couldnapost follow my own path. And she is trying to find her purpose in the world.

Evie Plumb, now , realised she hadnapost been taught much about STIs after she contracted both the HPV virus and chlamydia. The entrepreneur from Bishopaposs Stortford, Herts, recalled first realising she had contracted an infection when she had genital warts. She said: “I convinced myself I was dying and I was filled with shame. After Googling her condition, Evie said she felt even worse - and realised thereaposs not much information available about STIs online. Once sheaposd been treated for both conditions, Evie decided it was high time women were more educated about sex - including how to reach orgasm. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereCreating a community called the Clitorati on Instagram, Evie began posting funny but informative explainers on everything from sex toys to the G-spot.During the first lockdown in  she launched a podcast interviewing sex experts around the world - and even released her own brand of lubricant. Now, she has , followers on her Cliterally The Best Instagram page, who are keen to learn more about womenaposs sexual pleasure. She said: I think the biggest thing is all about unlearning and learning instead to own your pleasure and self-pleasure, because there is so much shame around this.  As well as talking about the fun aspects of sex, she also uses her  to educate women on the HPV virus - which is the name for  dferent strains of virus that affect the mouth, throat or genital area.According to the NHS, most of us will contract at least one of these strains in our letime.Evie, who is in a long-term relationship with boyfriend Josh, , said: “When you are little, sex education is so shame-based and you are told everything is bad, like getting pregnant. You learn nothing about enjoyment – it’s all, aposDon’t do this and don’t do that.apos “It takes a while to unlearn it all.”  She looks back on her childhood in explaining why she was so interested in liberating women in their sexual desires. Evie recalls being slut shamed in a society that made girls feel wrong for showing an interest in sex and pleasure. She added her lack of knowledge around the female orgasm meant her early sexual experiences were fumbling and anti-climactic - literally.Evie said: The first time you have sex, you are told you’ll have these orgasms and then there’s no focus on female pleasure. You are waiting for a moment of epiphany that is unlikely to happen.I used to focus on what men thought about me and what they wanted. Now, Iaposm not selfish, but I do stuff for me, not for other people.You have to learn to ask for what you want and advocate for your own pleasure. After her Cliterally The Best Instagram page took off, Evie launched a website where women can learn about gynaecological health and pick up sex tips.Since launching the pages, Evie says sheaposs been inundated with messages of thanks from women who are having better sex. I had one woman in her s come up to me and thank me so much for recommending this sex toy, because she had her first orgasm, she said. It makes it feel worthwhile. As Evie has grown in popularity, sheaposs been dubbed the sexual pleasure fairy godmother. She is now qualied to teach sex education - but insists she is constantly researching and learning more about sex, gender and intimacy.Although she was initially apprehensive about talking to her family about her new enterprise, Evie is now proud of her work.She said: “When I originally launched the podcast with my friend, I didn’t tell my parents what it was about, but as it grew, I explained and they were a little hesitant but just wanted to know I was safe.“But as it got bigger and I started to have press mentions, they were happy to learn about it and have been very supportive ever since.” However, despite receiving plenty of support for her work, Evie still has to put up with slut-shaming by trolls - and says she receives unsolicited X-rated images from men at least twice a week.She said: “I’m numb to them now, but they used to make me very, very angry.Sadly, there is no reasoning with these people. It’s a power thing and you have no consent in whether or not you see it.”She claims she was even contacted by a man who blamed Evie when his we wanted a orce - because he wasnapost sexually fulfilling her. Evie said: “He tried to blame me because she mentioned my page. She told him to, aposGo to this and learn what I meanapos.” As Evieaposs movement grows, she hopes to also move into the role of sex ambassador for schools and to design a sex education course for kids.She said: My dream is to do a course to become a psychosexual therapist and turn Cliterally The Best into a hub people come to for information and therapy.I want therapy to be more accessible and to make the website a home for sex and learning.I would like to see the conversation around sex education become a normal thing, to be spoken about as openly and without shame.

She’d been working for supermarket chain Spar and had been given responsibility for its partnership with the charity Marie Curie. “My role was to promote the partnership in Spar stores,” Laura tells The Mirror. And while she worked closely with the charity in her career, she never had any idea how its nurses would end up touching her le.When the first coronavirus lockdown came into effect, Laura decided to move back to Cookstown to look after her parents, who were struggling with poor health.  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Her dad Emmet had been suffering from ongoing heart problems, while her mum Ailish was battling bowel cancer. “I thought, ‘They’re going to need help’. I worried for them. Dad had been poorly for a number of years, and at the time my mum was going through chemo,” she explains. Emmet and Ailish, who had met when they were just  years old, had been married for more than three decades and were an inspiration to Laura. “I grew up with a modest childhood but it was a happy le. It wasn’t filled with big extravagant things,” she says. Laura describes her dad, who worked as a taxi driver, as someone who “lit up a room.” She says: “My dad was very down to earth. He loved le. He had a huge big smile and his laugh was contagious.”  Good with advice, Emmet’s taxi was likened to a confession box because his passengers often confided in him. “He’d never tell us anything though. He knew everything everyone was doing in town but he kept it to himself,” Laura says. But while he never gossiped about others, Laura says her dad often gushed about his daughter to passengers. “I’d come home and people would know all about me - he’d talk about me all the time. I think he was proud of me,” she says. Despite his lust for le, Emmet’s physical health was declining and he’d suffered from heart problems for several years. When Laura moved back to Cookstown she knew he would need help looking after Ailish while she had chemotherapy.  She describes her mum as the “rock who held everything together” in the family. “She loved to travel - I think that’s where I get my adventurous streak from,” Laura says. “She was more like a friend sometimes, I’d have told her anything.” Growing up holding her parents in such high regard, Laura says it was dficult to see them in ailing health - but she cherished the time she spent with them during lockdown. In the summer of  Emmet’s health took a turn for the worse and he ended up in hospital. “He started to really deteriorate and he was in the hospital for nearly three months,” Laura recalls.  “He was in and out of ICU so I told the doctors thatthis was only going in one direction I’d prefer to have him at home. He was such a homely man.” At the end of August, Emmet was brought back to the family home where he was visited by Marie Curie nurses every day. “He was such a proud Irishman, and even in his last days those nurses helped him keep his dignity,” Laura recalls. “To be that vulnerable with your we and daughter in the room is hard, but they supported him with a pain-free ending. They made sure he was really comfortable.” Emmet sadly passed away on  September  at just  years old. Although Laura and Ailish were devastated, they were grateful for the support the nurses had given them during his last days. As Emmet was laid to rest, Ailish and Laura came together with her three brothers to give him as traditional a funeral as they could while social distancing rules were in place.  And while Laura drew strength from a supportive family, the next few months were tough for her and her mum - who was still battling cancer. “We originally found out mum had cancer after she’d visited my oldest brother in Australia,” Laura recalls. “She got pains in her stomach and they thought it was appendicitis, so she had an operation while she was out there. “But when she got home she had a follow-up. She was diagnosed with bowel cancer and it was stage .” Laura says Ailish had a few successful operations to clear ious tumours, but over the years the cancer had continued to spread. By the time Laura had gone home to see her parents during lockdown, Ailish’s care was palliative.  And just months after Emmet’s death, Ailish and Laura received the news they were dreading. Laura recalls: “We sat down with the consultant on Zoom at the end of February and he said the cancer was spreading. My mum asked how long she had and he replied, ‘You’ve got until Easter’. “Mum had just celebrated her th birthday and she looked well. She didn’t look like someone who was dying of cancer. “I said to the consultant, ‘Do you know when Easter is  It’s only six weeks away’. And he said, ‘Yeah, six weeks’.” From that moment on, Laura says she went into “autopilot,” thinking only of her mum.  “Everything I did was for her. She was my priority,” Laura says. As Ailish began to deteriorate, she and Laura began to talk openly about how she wanted her le to end. “We talked about her potentially going into a hospice but we have a huge family, and with Covid restricting visitors, we decided it was best for her to be at home,” Laura says. “She deteriorated slowly, but the Marie Curie nurses helped her too. Mum knew she was dying and the fear and anxiety were very tough for us all.” Laura recalls the nurses arriving at the family home to take care of Ailish and askingthey had the wrong address - because they’d only been there nine months before caring for Emmet. But she doesn’t know how she’d have got through it all without their support.  “They were like walking angels,” she says. Meanwhile, Laura devoted all her time to be with her mum and refused to leave her side. She says: “People had to force me to go to bed. I didn’t want to sleep because I thoughtI slept, that was less time I’d have with mum.” In the last weeks of her le, Ailish laughed and joked with her daughter as they had always done - and even had fun talking about Laura’s love le. “Mum was in bed a lot and we’d be up all hours talking about my future and what my wedding day would be like.“It must have been am and I was on Facebook Dating. We came across a guy called Peter and mum said, ‘Message him, he looks lovely’.”After following her mum’s advice, Laura got chatting to Peter, who was also from Cookstown, and soon after he asked her out on a date.“I was reluctant to go on a date,” Laura recalls. “Mum was my priority and I worried something would happen while I was out.” But friends and family convinced Laura to go, arguing she needed to do something for herself. And after spending a few hours on a walk with Peter, Laura realised she’d made the right decision. The pair realised they’d both lived fairly close by in London for years - and their paths had almost crossed several times before. Although the pair clicked instantly, Laura was keen to get home to see Ailish after a few hours - but she said Peter was understanding from the beginning. “He stuck by me and understood - most guys wouldn’t,” she said. Over the next days and weeks, Peter checked in with Laura every single day - eventhe pair hadn’t seen each other. Sadly, on  June , Ailish passed away at home - and less than a year after losing her dad, Laura had to plan her mum’s funeral too.  Once again, her tight-knit family rallied around to support her while she grieved - and this time, Laura had Peter to lean on too. “He came to the wake and was introduced to everyone - my whole family was there,” Laura says. “When I came back to the house after the funeral and everyone had gone, there was just silence. It’s probably the worst feeling I’ve ever had in my whole le. That’s when the grief takes over. “But Peter was there for me.” After losing both her parents in a short space of time, Laura began to re-evaluate things in her le and made some big decisions. She decided to quit her job and set up her own marketing company, giving herself the freedom to work whenever and wherever she wanted - and fitting in Peter’s work around that. “I live le very dferently now,” Laura says. “I wake up now and it hits me every day like a ton of bricks. But I have a choice: I can stay in bed all day or I can get up and do something positive every day, evenit’s something little.  “Don’t get me wrong, I still have down days, but I think, ‘what would my parents thinkthey were watching me now’ ” As Laura and Peter navigate a new way of living their lives, Laura is keen to encourage people to talk about their grief - admitting that telling people about what her parents were like is incredibly cathartic for her. “Over the last two years during the pandemic, so many more people have lost loved ones,” she says. Laura adds it’s important to acknowledge those we have lost - and she’s taking part in Marie Curie’s National Day of Reflection on  March to honour them. While le is ing to some kind of normal as Covid restrictions are lted, the charity wants to acknowledge those who are still grappling with grief after losing people during the pandemic. It will hold a minute’s silence at midday in tribute to those who died and will also be hosting a Wall of Reflection. For Laura, who holds the charity close to her heart, the day will provide some comfort as she remembers Emmet and Ailish.Do you have a love story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcShe says: “Before I lost my parents I used to thinksomeone lost a loved one you shouldn’t talk about it for fear of upsetting them. “But now,I get an opportunity, I talk about them.

But Bailey has been left all alone, after -year-old Naja was put down last week following a rapid deterioration in her health. It comes less than  months after the pair lost Malika in October , at the age of . Now, staff at Colchester Zoo are keeping a close eye on lonely Bailey and are even considering relocating him to another zoo with a pride of lionesses.  In a statement issued on their website earlier this week, zoo staff wrote: We would like to thank all our visitors for the overwhelming support that we have received following the devastating news of the passing of our female lioness, Naja, on Friday, March . We have received many kind messages towards our staff, as well as concerns about our male lion, Bailey. Bailey’s health and welfare is our top priority and, whilst our Animal Care Team continues to monitor him daily, discussions have been put in place by the Animal Care Management Team regarding Bailey’s future at Colchester Zoo. The team are currently exploring bringing in a female lioness for Bailey, but this option is reliant on a lioness being available at one of our neighbouring zoos. However, given Bailey’s age, introducing a female at this stage in his le could prove too stressful. The team are also exploring relocating Bailey to another zoo with a pride of lionesses. This would be dependent on another organisation having the space to house Bailey and the move alone could prove too much. Bailey has become a big part of the Colchester Zoo family and parting with him feels almost impossible and irresponsible.

It’s our responsibility to ensure that Bailey’s welfare is at the forefront of any decision made, which may include letting him live out the rest of his le here at the zoo by himself. A previous statement last week paid tribute to Naja, writing: Naja was truly one of a kind. Her personality and character set her aside from any other animal we’ve had the pleasure to work with. Naja had a gentle side where she would interact with her keepers, but very quickly changed when food was available! Not only will all the staff at Colchester Zoo miss Naja, but she also leaves behind our male lion, Bailey. Bailey and Naja were cousins along with Naja’s sister, Malika, who passed away back in .

But they have put out an urgent plea for help to find a new home, close to Lancashire, for their family - as their isolated location has become uninhabitable. DAS Dalmatians is currently based just outside Newton Abbott, Devon - or the middle of nowhere, as they describe it.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.The property gets flooded every time it rains, and the roads are so bad that emergency services cannot reach it, reports the LiverpoolEcho.Sue said: We live in a stable that is down a bridleway. No one will deliver anything.aposaposA few weeks ago we had an electrical fire, and we were very lucky that Dave and I were awake otherwise who knows what could have happened.aposaposThe couple were forced to stop taking in new dogs last month due to the state of their premises. But they want to keep to continue on their mission to help dalmatians, so they are now appealing for dog-friendly potential landlords to get in touch. The couple currently live in a triple stable, with a kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a lounge - which is usually filled with dalmatians. And le with a pack of dogs is tough - as it means getting up before sunrise to let the dogs out into their field. Sue said: Biscuit likes to sing to us at .am every morning until one of us gets up and lets him onto our bed. Thankfully heaposs the only one that does that. The dogs donapost live in kennels or cages - instead lounging about on the beds and sofas around their converted stable home.  Dinnertime consists of shovelling out kg of dog biscuits every day, with Sue on hand to make sure every dog gets enough. Sue, a full-time dog mum, said: Le with these dogs is madness - but I wouldnapost have it any other way. You have to be dotty to have so many spotties. Iaposve always loved dogs but I love dalmatians because they are dferent. The first dog the couple helped was a six-month-old puppy who was being sold as part of a drug deal. Sue said: The poor little mite was very skinny, dirty and stunk of smoke. We have been asked to help more and more dogs over the years and have never wanted to stop. The couple rehome the dalmatians that are able to live a normal le after being assessed and rehabilitated but take in the kids that cannot be rehomed. She said: These pups stay with us forever being loved and having the best we can give them. We also help dogs that other rescues say no to. If a dog needs our help, I will do whatever I can do to helpwe have room but sadly at the moment, we can not help dogs that are threatened to be euthanised as we do not have room to keep them separated while being assessed.  The eldest of their dogs are Zakky and Zena, aged  who has been with Sue for two years. The pair are brother and sister whose owner died and left them on their own. Sue said: Zakky has a long bite history and bit Dave on meeting him - which can happen quite often with new problem kids. Zakky took a while to realise he didn’t have to bite anymore and now is one of the family and very loving. Zena now has dementia but still knows how to con her Dad into sharing his food with her. We stopped them from being separated - another rescue was going to split them up but they were  years old, it would have been awful for them to do that so they came here. They need to find a new home soon so they can take more dogs - and ideally, one that is in a more suitable location, more easily accessible for food deliveries and vet visits. Sue said: There are no kennels and as the dogs are free-range, they are very happy and don’t bark. Keeping them in a home environment is much better for their well-being. We live in a stable that is down a bridleway. No one will deliver anything. We are on the side of a valley, so every time it rains it floods us. The roof has holes in it so we are exposed to the elements. In summer it is so dusty - I get such bad chest infections. The road is so narrow and bumpy that emergency services are also unable to reach us. aposaposOn Sunday we had an electrical fire, and we were very lucky that Dave and I were awake otherwise who knows what could have happened.aposapos Sue continued: People donapost realise that the dogs are so quiet because they donapost live in kennels - they donapost make a noise. We have so many wonderful dogs that need our care, a huge mixture of ages - and we donapost want them to live in mud anymore.aposapos Sue and Dave, who run the sanctuary full-time, are ideally after a long term let, within a few hours drive of Morecambe Bay in a rural setting with at least an acre of land and a yard.You can donate to the sanctuary here.

However, the aggressive cancer ed and at the beginning of this month Gordon was told he likely had just weeks to live,The Daily Recordreports.Gordon, from Dundee, had two dying wishes - to marry partner of -years Audrey, , and host a living wake for himself.  Initially both events were planned for March  but doctors advised the family to move the wedding forward and within  hours they had planned the event at their family home. Step-daughter Kirsty McLean, , said: We got the blood test results on Friday and doctors said the disease was progressing fast and he might not make it to the wedding. Within  hours we had organised a wedding to happen at the house. We were running all over town trying to arrange everything and get cakes. We decorated the house and stuff as well with balloons. It was just close family and friends that attended. Weaposre now planning his living wake at the moment and waiting on another blood test to see how much the cancer has progressed.I had personally never heard of a living wake before and didnapost know it was a thing but he wants to get all his pals together one last time to say goodbye. The living wake is currently planned for March  at Gordonaposs favourite local, Club  in Dundee, but the family expect they will need to bring the event forward again. A band has been booked for the entertainment and a photo booth and photographer have been booked to capture precious memories. Loved ones will also be encouraged to write down their favourite memories with Gordon to share at the special event.  Gordon, who is step-dad to Kirsty, Tami and Dana, and dad to Kerr, is also hoping to have a final outing with his grandchildren. I donapost know how Iaposll manage at the wake, all my sisters and I have done is cry, Kirsty said. We are all just in so much shock - we couldnapost believe it - because he did get the all clear in January. My mum is one of the strongest women Iaposve ever met. Itaposs just her there on her own trying to do everything for him so I think it will really hit her after. Dave Mack from Club said they would make sure Gordon, nicknamed Googs, had a very special evening. Googs is a very well respected member of the Club and dart team,” he said. “Heaposs a good friend of mine as well and has been here for years as a leader of the darts team. For his living wake we will assist his family and make sure we give him something very special. He is such a great guy - he popped in the other week to see everyone and the club was full of people wanting to hi. Weaposre going to pull out all the stops for him to give him a great farewell. The family have scraped together so they could pay for the last minute wedding and are currently paying for the wake with their own cash. Tami has launched a fundraising page to go towards the cost of the wake as leftover cash will go to Gordonaposs final outing with his grandchildren.Donations to the page can be madehere .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsCancerLeukaemia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dubbed ‘Deltacron’, the new French-based strain combines both lineages. However, its severity is not yet known.But there is a warning that immunity is waning in the elderly as one scientist added that it is aposthe real thingapos. The World Health Organisation said it is apostracking and discussingapos the iant following research into the strain. There is no clear data yet to show whether Deltacron is more infectious than its predecessors. Health chiefs told The Sun a very small number of cases have been detected in Britain, but more details are to be reported in a briefing on Friday.Aris Katzourakis, professor of evolution and genomics at the University of Oxford, said: “It is one to keep an eye on. This one is legit. Dr Stephen Grfin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said: “Whilst it doesn’t seem to have taken off as a dominant strain yet, this could be due to a very slow start based upon seeding density - the number of initial cases, he said.“There are multiple scenarios that can play out here in terms of what this means for people that become infected as this combination of viral proteins may behave dferently to either parent. “The French cluster appears to be a validated occurrence where a recombination event has given rise to a virus fit enough to circulate.Last month, the UK Health Security Agency announced it was investigating a iant named “Delta x Omicron Recombinant ”.However, it is not knownthis is linked to the French-based Deltacron.  Hospitalisation in the UK have shown an aposuptickapos in the past fortnight, data shows. The ZOE Covid Symptom Study estimates around , people are catching Covid each day - a  per cent hike in one week. Study co-founder Professor Tim Spector said: “The ‘official’ UK dashboard rate that continues to provide a misleading picture of the pandemic in the UK and should be scrapped. “The major increase in new cases across the country and in the elderly is a worry, especially as we now see an uptick in hospitalisations for the first time. “This increase was predicted when all restrictions were lted. “We are likely to continue to see high infection and prevalence rates of  in  people for the foreseeable future.” Dr Jenny Harries, head of the UKHSA, said: “The increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see Covid circulating at high levels.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of OxfordCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But after the port worker had been off work for more than four months, his bosses were given a tip-off that he was instructing Hapkido classes. The bosses at PD Ports hired private investigators to carry out aposcovert surveillanceapos on Mr Connorton - and were provided with photos and videos of him teaching the Korean martial art to a class of . The covert recordings showed him driving to class, adopting aposfighting stancesapos, wielding training swords, demonstrating combat moves and carrying heavy objects aposwithout obvious signs of discomfortapos.When the  year old was summoned to explain himself, he claimed he aposcouldnapost rememberaposhe attended any other classes while off injured because his medication gave him aposmemory lossapos. Mr Connorton was sacked for gross misconduct but has tried to sue PD Ports for disability discrimination - however now his case has been thrown out at an employment tribunal. Mr Connorton, who has been training in martial arts since he was , is a th Dan black belt in Hapkido and has won tournaments in the discipline. Alongside others he set up his own class about  years ago and now teaches at Hapkido Teesside in Middlesbrough. The tribunal, held in Newcastle, heard Mr Connorton worked for PD Ports, one of the UKaposs leading port groups operating  dock sites nationwide.  He was a dockyard worker at the companyaposs Teesport site on the River Tees, North Yorks, and worked for the firm since . The tribunal heard Mr Connorton was signed off sick in October  after suffering a aposspasm of painapos at work caused by a degenerative disc bulging from his spine. In February  he told Occupational Health - who visited him at home due to him claiming he was in too much pain to travel - that he was unable to do anything other than read, which he could do while lying on his bed or sofa. On February , Mr Connortonaposs bosses received a report he was aposactually teaching his martial arts classapos. The next day he told Occupational Health his pain had not improved, he could not drive and his symptoms were causing aposlow mood and fatigueapos. However, the same evening he drove to his martial arts class. The private investigators discovered he drove to and attended the Hapkido class on February ,  and  - and they filmed him on each visit. A tribunal report said:The investigators provided PD Ports with a report and photographs and a video recording. Amongst other things, the investigatorsapos report refers to Mr Connorton, without any obvious signs of discomfort or ailment, driving to and from the class. [It shows him] rising from the floor after conducting stretching exercises with a class of approximately  people, assisting with student development, lting a metal barrier and then a five-a-side football goal. [It shows him] carrying a number of training swords and walking approximately  metres carrying a large sports bag holstered over his right shoulder, providing instruction, contributing to martial arts activity instruction including adopting a fighting stance and shouting to all the class that he was about undertake aposmock testsapos for those who wanted to practice. The photographs are supportive of the above in that they show him arriving at the class driving himself in his car, walking without any apparent discomfort, carrying a bag and equipment and moving barriers and a football goal. In the class itself the claimant is shown wearing his Hapkido suit, exercising, conducting exercises, kneeling and demonstrating martial arts moves and techniques. In light of this report, PD Ports was concerned at the apparent disparity between what he was reporting and what he was doing, and that he was not being truthful. During a disciplinary process, Mr Connorton was shown the images but said he could not rememberhe had attended other classes between October  and February  aposdue to drugsapos. Mr Connorton said he was aposnot instructing but was showing and guiding othersapos, which the tribunal ruled was aposlittle more than semanticsapos. He claimed the items he carried were light and he went to the class to improve his mental health but was still in pain. He said he had not done anything aposstrenuousapos. He was sacked in March , with bosses citing apossignicant doubts with regard to your honesty and integrityapos. Employment Judge John Morris ruled the dismissal was fair and had nothing to do with him being disabled as a result of his injury. He said: The reason for [Mr Connortonaposs] dismissal was his lack of candour and frankness throughout the disciplinary process and his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for his attendance at the Hapkido classes. The key point for [PD Ports] was the aposdisconnectapos between what he had said to Occupational Health on February  and the information from the surveillance team.

Actually called Vincent, the lonely dog is hoping somebody in the UK will come forward to offer in a place in their home. A spokesperson from Blind Dog Rescue UK said: Introducing the gorgeous Vincent who has the unfortunate nickname of Mr Ugly at the shelter.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.He is leishmania positive which caused his blindness and will need regular medication and blood tests for this for his entire le.Since being rescued from the mountains, Vincentaposs fur has completely grown back, meaning he can soon leave his Mr Ugly nickname behind. He has been described as a clam, sweet, and sociable dog who enjoys spending time with humans. New places and situations are stressful for him but he gets used to it quickly, said the spokesperson. In the shelter, he is dominant with other male dogs but he is friendly and playful with female dogs.Vincent would love a patient home where he can learn to trust his new family and can live with a female dog for company. Vincent is currently living in a rescue in Greece but is ready to fly to the UK once a family is found. Blind Dog Rescue UK works to rehome blind and partially sighted dogs who have been subjected to the “worst of humanity yet still have an astonishing capacity to adapt, love and become perfect ambassadors for blind dogs everywhere”. Many of the dogs in their care have been victims of abuse, neglect, disease or trauma - and struggle to survive in shelters. A Blind Dog Rescue UK statement reads: “It is incredibly dficult for sighted dogs to survive anyof time in these shelters let alone blind or partially sighted dogs. “We need to get to these dogs quickly and secure their immediate release and treatment.“These dogs may have been deliberately blinded, involved in road traffic accidents or long term sufferers of painful conditions such as glaucoma.“They need veterinary care and to be given the safety and comfort of a foster home in which to start healing. “Here they are given love and affection and a warm bed - possibly the first they will have experienced in their letimes. At this point, we are able to start assessing and promoting these wonderful dogs for forever homes.To adopt Vincent, or find out more information about him, contact Blind Dog Rescue UK via their website www.bdruk.org.Do you have a story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hospital admissions have also risen sharply, with , people in hospitals with the virus on March  and  requiring a mechanical ventilator.The worrying figures come just weeks before the government plans to scrap free lateral flow tests for most people on April .Are you worried by the rise  Have your say in the comment section Free PCR tests will also not be available to people with symptoms as the government implements its aposLiving with Covidapos plan, introduced on February .

The figure was a drop on the . percent recorded between January  and , but was the second-highest rate since the study started in .  The React- data comes from nearly , swabs from homes across England. It shows infections have dropped since the January peak but scientists involved said the R value, or the average number of infected, remained below  for those  and under. But for those  and over it stood at .. Experts are investigating whether hospitalisation rates are being driven by “unshielding”, where some of the most vulnerable people have ed back to normal after two years of self-isolation. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency , told Sky News: These data confirm that cases have declined substantially following the peak of the Omicron wave.However, the increasing presence of the BA. sub-lineage of Omicron and the recent slight increase in infections in those over  show that the pandemic is not over and that we can expect to see COVID circulating at high levels.  Professor Paul Elliot, director of Imperial College Londonaposs React programme, said: At the moment, weaposre possibly seeing the beginning of an uptick, but we donapost know where itaposs going to go. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said it was “impossible to make a sensible prediction” about the size of any BA. wave but the situation needed close monitoring.He told the: “The worry is that it’s hard to see anything happening in the next few weeks that will reverse the growth of BA. unless, that is, people decide on their own account to step up precautions.”Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, said the recent rise was foreseeable. “We’ll see a great deal more of this, along the lines of recent resurgent spikes in Scotland and Hong Kong,” he said. “Caseloads were by no means low or under control as we came out of all mitigations and, when you add in waning immunity and the enhanced transmissibility of BA., it looks like we are in for a dficult period, especially for the elderly.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSDepartment of HealthGrant ShappsHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chased by owner Tess Swan, Kratu bounded gleefully around the course, missing jumps, ignoring obstacles and even running over to say hello to a group of volunteers mid-way through.Then he ran into a plastic tunnel and failed to come out the other side, finally emerging from the end he had gone in. Commentator Peter Purvis declared: “I love it. That’s the real trick, to turn around in there. How did he do that ” The joyful display won Kratu, a fluffy Carpathian-Mioritic mix, fans around the world and invites back to Crufts for the next two years.  His  agility performance, his last before retiring, was just as show-stopping, the mischievous Kratu even making off with a pole from one of the hurdles. But while Kratu and Tess’s Crufts appearances never fail to amuse, the story of how they found each other – and rescued each other – is truly heartwarming. Tess, , whose book, Incredible Kratu, was published this week, credits him with helping her recover after she fell into a spiral of addiction and abuse. She says: “He saved my le. I was very tired of le. Some of my memories are horric. I saved Kratu’s le, and he’s saved mine many times. “He’s the reason I get up every morning.”Undiagnosed autistic Tess’s le began to fall apart at the age of  after her father died and she found herself living in a filthy squat in a block of flats in Lambeth, north London. After her boyfriend died of a drugs overdose, Tess turned to heroin as “a respite from the pain”. She says: “I’d tried to take my own le a couple of times. Living was so painful. I was totally used and abused.” Tess, who had a daughter in this time, got deeply involved in London’s criminal world. But contracting hepatitis C was a “wake-up call” and she moved to Cambridgeshire, where she got clean, but still struggled with PTSD. Then a dog rescuer friend, Celia, found a “frightened pup” in a Roma camp in Romania. Tess says: “She told me she knew he was the one for me. I soon fell in love with him, I knew he was going to be my best friend.” But he was a handful – “like having the Honey Monster on a lead” – so she got help from dog trainer Wendy Kruger at Wood Green Animal Shelter in Godmanchester, Cambs. Kratu came on so well she entered him into some agility courses at dog shows. Tess recalls his first, saying: “We were just coming up to the last jump and he turned around and did the entire course backwards, with me chasing him in astonishment. “It was hilarious.”  Tess and Kratu entered Crufts in , when he completed the course without many mishaps. It was on theirthe next year that he stole the show. Tess says: “When he went into that tunnel and didn’t come out the other end, I was like a rabbit in the headlights. It was like, ‘Where the b****y hell has my dog gone ’ “Afterwards I gave him a big hug. I realised what he did was far better, he was a free spirit. That ticked all my boxes. I just embraced him for the rebel and the rascal that he is.  “He makes me laugh so much and that’s one of the biggest gts for me, to laugh, after a letime of crying and pain and sadness and despair. “He knows what sets me off, and now I roar with laughter at him.” Incredible Kratu by Tess Eagle Swan and Lynne Barrett-Lee is available now .

Kate had her sister Pippa as her maid of honour while Prince William chose his younger brother Prince Harry as his best man.Harry kept up best man tradition by giving a speech at the wedding reception - and according to many of the guests it was the highlight of the big day, evenhe did make Kate cry. Royal author Katie Nicholl gave an insight into the tear-jerking speech in her biography Harry: Le, Loss, and Love.  She said: It was affectionate, warm and funny and touched William deeply. The speech was peppered with Harryaposs classic sense of humour, and he ribbed his brother: aposWilliam didnapost have a romantic bone in his body before he met Kate, so I knew it was serious when William suddenly started cooing down the phone at Kateapos. Famous for his mimicry, Harry then impersonated his brother calling Kate aposBabykinsapos, to much laughter from the guests.

When he said the couple’s decade-long romance was his inspiration, there was a shy smile from Chelsy, while Kate shed a tear. Kate and brother-in-law Harry previously had a jovial relationship - he even famously described Kate as the sister he never had and the pair were often seen giggling or sharing a joke at royal events.But according to royal expert Duncan Larcombe, Harry and Kateaposs sibling-like relationship is now long in the past.  It comes amid a growing feud between William and Harry and the fact that Harry and we Meghan Markle decided to quit as royals and leave the UK for Calornia. And speaking earlier this year as Kate approached her th birthday, Duncan told OK! : Kate was, as Harry said, the sister he never had and clearly that is not the case anymore.There was a time when Harry would have been instrumental in any celebrations or any fun that the couple were having, but those days are long in the past.

She quickly settled on being a delivery driver, which she could fit around her current hours at the airport and soon realised how lucrative her second job could be.The mum-of-one, from Worthing, West Sussex, did so well that she eventually decided to quit her day job after two years. She can now rake in up to a grand a week by putting in -hour days and is able to plan her schedule around her two-year-old daughter.  And the profit she has made from the delivery job is enough to fund a nice lestyle, including a recent trip to Disney World in Florida. Atlanta said: Iaposm really happy I made the decision to do this job full time. With delivering, I can choose my own hours, work as much as I wish too and earn the same money or more. It was a risk as delivering is self employed and the money is not guaranteed, but I have no regrets and it is working really well.  Atlanta worked at Gatwick prior to giving birth and realised that she could make extra money by delivering while on maternity leave. She said: I worked there for three and a half years but I have a daughter who is coming up to three years old. The hours I had to work and the sht pattern was not flexible enough at the airport. I started delivering whilst on my maternity leave as an extra form of income. Thanks to the flexibility of delivering, I found I could work the hours I wanted to around my daughter. I started posting videos of me delivering on my social media which did really well so I decided to leave my full time job so I could pursue delivering and growing my social media channels.  Since ditching the airport job, Atlanta has been putting in the hours working on her own time delivering in the car for Just Eat, Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Beelivery. She starts as early as am and works until as late as :pm - racking up around  deliveries on a busy day. Her hard work has been worth it as sheaposs been raking in the cash, making up to £, a week through delivering across the south east of England. Between February  and February  alone, she earned £. from Just Eat, £. from UberEats, £. from Deliveroo and £. from Beelivery, as well as £ in cash tips - totalling at an impressive £. in just one week.  Atlanta was amazed by the amount of money sheaposs been making alongside her boyfriend, Benjamin Hasker, , who also works as a delivery driver as well as a magician and doing Punch and Judy shows. The mum has no plans toto the airline industry and is thrilled with her new career. She said: Itaposs not guaranteed to be £, every week - the more hours you put in, the more you earn. Thanks to my hard work earning this amount of money, myself, my daughter and my partner all went to Disney World, Florida, for two weeks in December  . This was my daughteraposs first ever holiday. I have already bought two cars outright in the time that I have been delivering for work. I havenapost bought anything for my daughteraposs third birthday yet as it is in June, but we are planning to go to London for the weekend for a trip to London Zoo. Iaposm really happy I chose to pursue this as a full time career. It was a risk but I have no regrets.

The eccentric home is a random collection of childlike patterns and every colour of the rainbow. The combination of bright hues, swirly patterns, dot work and odd, out of place shapes on the walls and ceilings gives the flat a hallucinatory feel. There are also random images of famous people such as Elvis Presley, Nelson Mandela, Marilyn Monroe and, perhaps most bizarrely, Princess Diana, on the walls. Viewers of the Rightmove home, in Glasgow, Scotland, joked it could be the abode of lentil-loving hippie character Neil Pye from cult aposs Beeb sitcom The Young Ones.Even Westgate Estate Agents admits it requires a degree of cosmetic upgrading. One viewer - known only as Steven - said: Neil from The Young Ones is selling his flat in Glasgow. The weirdest bit is the picture of Princess Di in the middle of it all. He added: It is a great spot and price. Someone will get a pretty good place once itaposs gutted. Another bloke said: The place, the view, the price.... all pretty decent. But many grands needed to remove the psychedelic, drug crazed, decor.  Gave me a headache looking at the pics. And I like mad and bold stuff. Not groovy. He also quipped: Neilaposs place is a great description of it. Heavyyy. Alison Brook joked: Thereaposs nowt wrong with that house that sunglasses or a wrecking ball couldnapost fix! One house hunter said: Holy c**p, did someone slip the decorator LSD  Another bloke - Ewan - added: Bit too Scooby Doo for me.  The estate agents present it as a development opportunity.

The letter, which was published today, says the pandemic is not over and that the approach to vaccine equity is immoral, entirely self-defeating and also an ethical, economic and epidemiological failure.It says: The European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland continue to block the lting of intellectual property rules which would enable the redistribution and scale-up of Covid- vaccines, test and treatment manufacturing in the global south. The transfer of largely publicly funded vaccine technology and know-how from pharmaceutical corporations would fast track production to a matter of months. Yet still today, a handful of these corporations retain the power to dictate vaccine supply, distribution and price – and the power to decide who lives and who dies. World leaders, and particularly rich nations, have the responsibility to change this situation and ensure the publicly funded vaccine technology and know-how is available to the global south. The letter, which comes on the second anniversary of Covid- being declared a pandemic, is also signed by actress Charlize Theron, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

A brown Hungarian Puli, which has one of the most striving coats in the show ring, was seen snuggling with its owner as she made him show ready. According to The Kennel Club, the breed owes its origins to Hungarian herding dogs of the Far East, which accompanied the Magyars as they travelled west.

Many people have been greatly touched by Hayleyaposs wise words, which are so very important in an age where le filtered through a social media lens can seriously impact the way we view our bodies.One person thanked Hayley for bringing some honesty to Instagram, really admire you for this, while another described her honesty as inspiring.A third person remarked that they wished such pics were shown in high schools, adding: I speak for myself around that age, I only saw the ‘perfect’ Instagram bodies. It’s easy to lose track of what is picture-perfect and what is real. I’d rather see everyday-perfect than picture-perfect more. Because we are perfect in our own way: every. single. one. of. us.Do you have a body positivity story to share  We pay for stories.

Going through labour and giving birth is just about the most painful experience a woman can go through - and many women are left traumatised afterwards. And when it comes to taking the baby home, a new mumaposs mind will be all over the place, worrying about car seats, sleeping and night feeds. So for most mums, the idea of putting on a full face of make-up just after giving birth would barely enter their headspace. But one new mum on TikTok begs to dfer. The mother, who goes by the name Zee Zee, filmed herself getting ready to leave the hospital after giving birth via C-section - but not before she put her war paint on. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The mum, who posts under the handle @mamazeezee, filmed herself drawing on her eyebrows, putting on primer, applying foundation, and then contouring her face. She also applies eyeshadow, blusher and highlighter before completing her look with mascara. In another shot, the new mum chows down a delicious-looking taco, with the caption: Break time, Iaposm hungry. After replenishing her energy supply, Zee Zee then pulls out her lashes and glue and applies those too. Finally, she applies lip liner and lipstick before putting a setting spray on her face.  In the final shot, Zee Zee turns the camera to face her boyfriend, who has been watching her apply her make-up while he holds the baby, with a baffled look on his face. She writes: My boyfriend judging me. In another video, Zee Zee, who has a knack for make-up, films herself applying a full face once again when she gets home - and she even curls her locks to complete the look. People impressed with her skills commented on her videos to tell Zee Zee they would have done exactly the same thing. One woman wrote: I hope I have this same energy after this baby in July. Another said: So happy seeing women take such good care of themselves after having a baby get it girl! But most people were baffled at how Zee Zee could have managed to put on a full face of make up so soon after a C-section.

Itaposs doubtful that additions such as tuna, olives, or turmeric will so much as cross your mind, with many of us preferring milder tastes before weaposve finished that all-important first cup of coffee.However, Deliveroo has rolled out a limited-edition trio of inventively savoury breakfast cereals, each one celebrating a popular takeaway dish.While stocks last, customers in London, Bristol, and Manchester can order a £ box of ‘DeliverOO’s’, selecting from a choice of Sushi Roll, Margherita Pizza, and Chicken Katsu Curry. Weaposve given the bizarre range a go for ourselves - and this is what we thought. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Margherita Pizza CerealI for one have had many a cold leftover pizza slice for breakfast in my time, so didn’t think this one would present too much of a challenge. However, I did hesitate a bit before pouring the milk into the bowl of tiny puff buckwheat kernels.The tomatoey taste comes through quite strongly here - more so than the cheese - but certainly isn’t unpleasant, and thereaposs also a subtle suggestion of basil oil which gives it a surreal rustic Italian feel. Of course, itaposs quite weird to get the familiar taste of doughy, rippable pizza crust encased inside such light - and quickly quite mushy - grain, but this certainly makes for a fun novelty. Out of the three, this undoubtedly tasted the most like the takeaway it was meant to represent, but Iaposm not sure I could stomach it every day, and I didnapost end up finishing the bowl.  Chicken Katsu CurryCereal Katsu curry is one of my all-time favourite takeaway dishes and I was seriously worried that trying a twisted version of it might spoil it for me a bit. I needn’t have feared. I sampled a few of the crunchy maize flakes dry before tucking in properly, and can honestly say that Iaposd happily chow down this product like a bag of crisps. I enjoy anything spicy, and this has a little kick to it that - although not everyoneaposs cup of tea at  am - tickled my taste buds nicely. The curry powder comes through quite strongly here, but the milk pleasantly balances it out, bringing a nice cooling effect. This was my favourite out of the trio by quite a long way, and I found myself munching down spoonful after spoonful.  Sushi RollCereal Now, admittedly this is the one I feared the most. Don’t get me wrong, I love sushi, but the very thought of mixing fish and rice up in a bowl of milk first thing in the morning - even in cereal form - just didn’t sit right with me.I poured a few of the puffed brown rice kernels into the bowl and had a tentative nibble. The overall sushi flavouring came through much more vigorouslythan I thought it would, while a distinct note of wasabi took me by surprise.There was also a strong gingery aftertaste. The brown rice texture went well with this, but it wasn’t screaming cereal to me. After stalling for a minute, I poured a glug of milk into the bowl and held my breath. It was by no means awful, although perhaps not something I could regularly rush down before a morning commute. The milk didn’t compliment the cereal quite as well as it did with the Katsu onebut it was undoubtedly an interesting addition to my breakfast and I was left impressed by the realistically fresh flavour. Okay, so I donapost think Iaposll be switching from my Crunchy Nut Cornflakes anytime soon, but this trio of cereals certainly made for one of the most adventurous breakfasts Iaposve had in a while.A Deliveroo spokespersonsaid: When we heard it was World Cereal Day, we wanted to ‘bowl’ over cereal lovers with a breakfast dish to remember.

And theyaposll also have some things that will put them off a place almost instantly. For one man, spotting what he thought to be aposcrime scene tapeapos inside a three-bedroom terraced home for sale in Preston, wasnapost a big selling point.The man was looking through Rightmove when he came across the house, which is on the market for £,.Images on the listing show that the toilet, taps in the bathroom, kitchen, fridge, fireplaces and even the boiler are covered in blue and white hazard-style tape similar to that used by homicide police.  One concerned viewer said: I found this property on Rightmove. And itaposs covered in police crime scene tape. Did the seller estate agent not think about removing it first  However, on closer inspection, it seems all is not as it initially appears as the tape is emblazoned with aposDo not useapos, whereas crime scene tape often features cordons splashed with aposPoliceapos or aposPolice line do not crossapos. There is no suggestion the pad in Preston, Lancs, was actually a crime scene. On the contrary, Taylors Estates claims the address is quite the steal as it has two bathrooms and boasts views of the River Ribble.  The estate agent adds: With parking available at the front of the property on the road, the house offers a small front courtyard style garden which leads to the front door and into an entrance vestibule. Continuing into the property and into the main hall you are met with the main open staircase on the left-hand side of the building and your first reception room on the right which boasts a great bay window to allow a flood of light. In the middle of the house sits the second reception room with a good-sized kitchen dinner to the rear of the house and utility sitting at the back. The back garden again is a small but cosy sized courtyard. The first floor houses the three double bedrooms with the master at the front of the house which is accompanied by an ensuite with toilet and walk-in shower.

Lee, of Colne, Lancashire, was so left impressed with Lloydaposs positive attitude and fantastic overall work that he offered him a regular job at his company.Going forward, Lloyd will be cleaning his uncleaposs vehicles every month in exchange for some hard-earned cash. His work ethic has clearly already paid off, as he was able to treat his crush to an upgraded date at a local milkshake parlour.Lee, , has since praised his nephewaposs work ethic online, in a post that has clocked up more than , likes and comments. The proud uncle explained: Lloyd just messaged me out of the blue and said that he wanted to take this young lady to McDonaldaposs and askedI had any work for him. I was really buzzing because Iaposve always had a job since I was , paper rounds and whatnot. Heaposs always expressed an interest in being a Saturday boy, earning a bit of money, and having a job to pay for his boxing classes and stuff like that. He never even had an inkling towards receiving any money for free. I said aposno problem, Iaposll find you something. Iaposm sure you can wash the vans and get them ready to goapos.Weaposre going to invite him back every month to do the vans inside and out, so heaposs gained himself a job from it, by just having that little bit of initiative and asking. Itaposs sort of the message that you want to send across really, it was just a chance message and I work in sales and operations so I see that day-to-day - Iaposll e-mail a client aposhow are you doing  We havenapost seen each other for a whileapos and sometimes it can turn into a job. I just wanted to show that to him, itaposs about getting off of your backside and he seems to be wanting to work and he showed that, I was really over the moon for him. Iaposve got two boys and a girl and I hope that they have that same ethic and drive that heaposs got, which is really good for a young lad. Speaking about his work, Lloyd said: It felt really good to finally be able to take the young lady out and it was just so much better with it being money that I earned myself through hard work. Meanwhile, a LinkedIn post written by Lee about his hardworking nephew has seen the youngster heaped with praise and hailed as an aposold-fashioned gentapos. Kim Billy Leipold commented: This is indeed inspirational. I used to do this when I was a kid, but not with car washing instead in our shoe factory. I help every weekend and summer vacations to earn money, helping to put on shoelaces, polish shoes and box them. As my parents taught meI was something I have to earn it either with good grades or by working! This kid will be in the future very successful! Kudos Kid!

She said: Usually my working from home consists of him still getting whatever attention he wants but since this was such an important meeting, I wasn’t doting on him like I normally would.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Halfway through the meeting I could hear him playing with something metallic because I could hear the little ting sounds from his teeth and nails. I’m not sure how I knew but in the moment I just knew it was my wedding ring. He did what any rational-thinking puppy would do -eat the most valuable item in my possession in order to teach me a lesson. I left my wedding ring on my bedside table, a mistake I no longer make, and he was able to hop up onto my bed and snatch it. Kind of a aposI’ll show her! She can’t work when I want to playapos. Seconds after Shyleraposs meeting ended, Finn wandered into the room and sat behind her impatiently waiting for her to start playing with him. After an unsuccessful search for her wedding ring, she ended up rushing Finn to the vets to get an X-ray. Despite being fed a bunch of high-fibre food at the vets, Finn did not make any aposofferingsapos, and Shyler was told to go home and examine his poo until her rings shows up. Thursday night: no ring. Friday morning: no ring. Friday midday: no ring, said Shyler, from Decatur, Illinoi. We brought him back to the vets office for another X-ray to be safe and to schedule a aposjust in caseapos X-ray for Mondayhe hadn’t produced it over the weekend. All weekend long, I mushed poo pile after poo pile. I’ve never been so grateful to have a mask to wear and still my dog’s stomach remained my grossest jewellery box. On Monday, a very stressful day for us, we discovered that after three and a half days my ring had started to make the journey to Finn’s forbidden zone. Thanks to my mother-in-law’s incredible cooking, my father-in-law always throwing Finn an extra treat or two, and my husband’s frantic games of fetch and ball catch, we got the ring back! Dramatic Finn was unknowingly just  minutes away from being taken back to the vets to undergo a surgery to remove the ring.Shyler added: Special thanks to the team at Northgate Pet Clinic- Decatur, IL who went above and beyond for my little furry terror and helped me see the humour in the situation with these X-ray pictures.He’s actually quite the legend at the vet’s office now too!

Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Alina Kabaeva - once described as “ Russia ’s most flexible woman“ - reportedly travelled to a “very private and very secure” chalet near here with the couple’s young children as the tanks rolled in.Widely believed to be the mother of Putin’s two sons and a daughter - or possibly two daughters - Kabaeva, , lives in a luxurious bubble, shielded from the horrors her -year-old partner is inflicting on innocent children.  Switzerland has a long history of providing low-tax secrecy to the world’s most powerful. Here, the Kremlin tyrant’s family is unlikely to be exposed.A source in Lugano, close to the Italian border, said: “Before the coronavirus pandemic there was often gossip about Putin’s mistress being in town. They are known to have strong connections here, but anyone who knows them has been sworn to secrecy.“While Russia falls apart because of the sanctions, this is the perfect place for Putin to send Alina and their kids.” Claims of Putin’s links to Lugano first surfaced seven years ago. In February , a local TV station reported that Kabeava had given birth at a private VIP maternity clinic in Sorengo, on the periphery of the city.  They were said to have reserved two rooms at the discreet private maternity hospital Clinic Sant’Anna - a favourite of wealthy Russians. One suite was for the birth the second for family and bodyguards. According to insiders, President Putin was present. The Kremlin, of course, dismissed the rumours, as it does any query about Putin’s private le. Kabaeva, one of the most decorated rhythmic gymnasts in history, has never confirmed whether they have one daughter, or twin girls. Likewise, neither has ever addressed claims they got married in a secret ceremony after Putin orced his first we. Bathed in balmy spring sunshine this week, the contrast between the restful serenity of the Sant’Anna and the maternity hospital bombed by Russian troops in Mariupol, Ukraine, could not be more stark.High-end clients drove expensive vehicles into an underground car park beneath a carefully manicured lawn, with a topiaried flamingo at the entrance. Birdsong could be heard in the little vineyard nearby. Meanwhile shells still pounded Mariupol at the other end of Europe, after heavily pregnant mums had been carried out on stretchers through the rubble. In Lugano’s glistening Piazza Della Rorma, where Kabeava is said to have been seen on occasions, grey-haired men stroll past the café terraces with statuesque supermodel girlfriends. Occasional snippets of Russian puncture predominantly Italian background chatter. It is a sedate place dominated by banks, pharmacies and designer goods, and restaurants with eye-wateringly expensive menus.  Above Lake Lugano, modernist four-storey villas with infinity pools are embedded into the mountains. Their owners drive directly onto the roof, and go downstairs in private elevators. These are perfect properties for people wanting to keep clear of prying eyes, Alina Kabaeva is not the only person close to Putin with links to Lugano. Oligarch Alexey Mordashov, Russia’s second-richest man with a personal fortune estimated at £bn last year, was added to the EU sanctions list last week. Steel and mining baron Mordashov, , was targeted because of Rossiya Bank, in which he has a stake.  Rossiya was described as the “personal bank” of Russian officials who benefited from the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in . The EU also said it believes media businesses Mordashov is invested in helped destabilise Ukraine through pro-Russian television stations. The export arm of Mordashov’s steel and mining empire, Severstal, is located in an anonymous office building in a drab industrial park in Manno, on the outskirts of Lugano. Mordashov’s below-the-radar presence is marked only on a list of business names on a sign in the car park. Last week the billionaire’s private jet was tracked as flying back to the Seychelles from Moscow. In a statement, Mordashov said he did not understand how his name was on the sanctions list, adding: “I have absolutely nothing to do with the emergence of the current geopolitical tension.”  Calling for an end to the current war, he went on: “It is terrible that Ukrainians and Russians are dying, people are suffering hardships, the economy is collapsing.” Russia’s richest .% - who together possess wealth greater than the remaining .% of the population - are not only attracted by Switzerland’s pleasant climate and stunning vistas. Recent data shows that around a third of their bank balances worldwide are in the Alpine nation. According to a  survey by ErnstYoung, banks in Zurich and Geneva are favoured by the oligarchs. Putin’s childhood friend from St Petersburg, Gennady Timchenko, was based in Switzerland until , when he was sanctioned by the US over the Crimean invasion. When Russia invaded Ukraine a fortnight ago, Timchenko was one of the first oligarchs sanctioned by Britain. Much of his wealth derived from being granted an oil export licence by Putin, his ice hockey buddy, in . He still owns a gigantic mansion on Lake Geneva. Like upmarket Belgravia in London, Switzerland has long been a playground for Putin’s oligarch friends with their limitless wealth. For Alina Kabaeva and Putin’s unseen children, it could also remain the ideal bolthole while her despot partner keeps shelling innocent civilians. Previously given high-profile political appointments because of her relationship, she is accustomed to obeying her bullying partner. As global outrage against Putin’s despicable war gets louder, the Ferraris and Lamborghinis still purr around Lake Lugano.

The ­desperate families squeezed in, standing, sitting, lying wherever they can, next to their precariously piled ­belongings, packed into the dank underground space they now call home. There’s an air of restlessness, a palpable sense of tension and anxiety. How could there not be And then, completely unexpectedly, something magical happens. Little Amelia – age unknown, but probably, what, seven or eight  – stands up on a chair. She’s wearing a sparkly jumper with stars on it, from HM a few years ago – my friend’s daughter has the same one and still loves it too. Hands clenched together shyly, unbrushed hair pulled back into a ponytail, Amelia plucks up all her courage, opens her mouth and starts to sing Let It Go, from Frozen. And like a spell cast in the movie her song comes from, the Kyiv shelter falls silent. Everyone turns and gives this small blonde scrap of a girl their mesmerised full attention. No one moves. Babies stop crying. This captive audience cannot take their eyes off her, as they listen to her sweet, steady voice, a chink of shining light in the unimaginable ­darkness of Ukraine.She has given these people the gt of focusing on something other than the living nightmare they’re enduring, albeit briefly, and there isn’t a dry eye in the room. Or from any of the millions around the globe who have since watched the video on social media.Despite probably never having heard Ukrainian before, the song is in the universal language of Disney, kids from any country in the world watching it could name that tune in three. In the caption, the woman who posted it explains that Amelia told her she wanted to be “a singer on a grand stage” – an ambition now fulfilled, just not in a way anyone would want. Their poor parents can, at least, try to fight back, but the children of Ukraine are utterly defenceless in this war. Putin is torturing and traumatising these pure, faultless human beings, turning them into orphans. Murdering  of them.  Amelia and the other kids in that shelter, and similar ones across the country. Danya and Mpak, the boys trapped in Calais, denied entry by our callous government because they don’t have the right paperwork. The -year-old who braved a -mile journey to safety alone. Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky’ s own children – Aleksandra, , and Kiril, age nine – who have targets on their backs. Polina, the girl with the pink hair, and her brother Semyon, both dead. And the many other nameless young casualties.All entirely blameless, innocent children – just like their entirely blameless, innocent mums and dads – frightened for their lives.  Two weeks ago they were moaning about homework, playing with their friends, not eating their vegetables. Now, suddenly plunged into a reality where growing up without their fathers may well be the best case scenario. The least worst of their horrendous options. When Let It Go lyricist Kristen Anderson-Lopez saw Amelia’s rendition, she tweeted: “Dear Little Girl with the beautul voice, my husband and I wrote this song. The way you sing it is like a magic trick that spreads the light in your heart and heals everyone who hears it.” She finished by urging Amelia to “Keep singing!” If only that choice was hers.

The -year-old, who lives out in Otago on New Zealandaposs South Island, lives an extraordinary le which involves performing dentistry on himself and not collecting any benefit to survive. There was no particular animosity or argument in the family that broke them apart - but the separation came after the death of Little Johnaposs brother which hit everyone very hard. Little John was battling addictions and watched the collapse of his relationship - and thataposs when he moved out to live in the cave. And he hasnapost moved for the last  years. After publication Stuff shared Little Johnaposs story, his family, including his sister based in Australia, got in touch saying they were so grateful for the words about him.Little Johnaposs sister said: It feels like a weight has been lted, no longer fearing the worst and wondering where he was. It also caused his father, who Stuff agreed not to name and who is based in Dunedin, New Zealand, to contact a foodbank to try to track him down. Michelle Kerr, from the Mosgiel Community Foodbank, told  News it was a huge step for him. Little John explained that he knew his fatheraposs address but hadnapost visited him since he moved to the South.  But on Wednesdaythe father and son were finally reunited after  years apart. Little Johnaposs dad said it was a wonderful experience. The pair enjoyed a meal and spent quality time together - Little John even spoke to his sister in Australia. Little John even found out his mother had died in . The father and son decided they plan to see each other again in the future.  Living several kilometers away from the closest human structure, Little John said itaposs there that he found peace with God and became close with his fellow Christians.Little John himself said the Stuff article had helped him too as he has been able to form bonds with local residents. Where previously they were wary of picking him up, he can now hitchhike. And a few weeks ago Little John said he heard people calling his name who had obviously gone looking for him. Struggling to find his cave at first, they began calling his name, to which he replied Gaposday. Little John said he had had some offers from hopeful aposcave womenapos, but not as many as he wanted. He particularly likes the cold months in the Otago caves and plans to spend winter there. Explaining why he lives in the cave he said for me itaposs natural, and natural is healthy.  He also doesnapost want to claim the unemployment benefit or eventually the pension because he said the money would give him access to his addictions. Little John explained heaposs always had a problem with booze and smokes but now he smokes and drinks much less basically because he canapost afford it. He has given up on Government support, come off the dole and closed his bank account in what he describes as a really big step. Doing odd jobs and using food banks, he gets by on around  a year. Little John added that he lives in a cave because itaposs free but also because nobody bugs him there.

But with state media having backed the Ukrainian invasion the majority of Russians appear to seemingly be in support of the invasion - and it is Putinaposs control over journalists that has helped him to rule without any signicant opposition. Now, though, on a programme hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, a staunch supporter of Putin’s regime, guests openly criticised the attack on Ukraine with one saying it was like “Afghanistan but even worse.” The use of Afghanistan as an example is signicant in Russia as it is seen as a military humiliation - with the country having spent  years in the country before withdrawing in . Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletin here Soloviyev has been peddling state propaganda even agreeing that the shelling of a maternity hospital in Mariupol this week was “fake news” - claiming the building was now being used by Ukraine troops.He was left fuming, though, by comments on his Thursday night show where they questioned what the Russians were doing in Ukraine.Karen Shakhbnazarov, a filmmaker and political commentator, took a dig at the decision to invade Ukraine on the Russia  channel. “The war in Ukraine paints a frightening picture, it has a very oppressive influence on our society. Ukraine, whichever way you see it, is somewhere with which Russia has thousands of human links, he said, reported the Daily Beast.  The suffering of one group of innocents does not compensate for the suffering of other innocent people... I don’t see the probability of denazication of such an enormous country. We would need to bring in . million soldiers to control all of it. He added: The most important thing in this scenario is to stop our military action. Shakhbnazarov did toe the country’s line that the war was caused by the United States but he said that a “humanitarian disaster” would also see Russia’s allies like China and India distancing themselves.  The host, who is one the Russians to have been sanctioned by the EU and has had an Italian villa seized, was left annoyed by the analysis but other guests were also critical. Semyon Bagdasarov, a Russian Middle East expert, agreed with Shakhbnazarov and said that Russians need to prepare for total isolation. He drew the parallels with Afghanistan saying: Let Ukrainians do this denazication on their own. We can’t do it for them... As for their neutrality, yes, we should squeeze it out of them, and that’s it.  We don’t need to stay there longer than necessary... Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse  There are more people and they’re more advanced in their handling of weapons. We don’t need that. Enough already... As for the sanctions, the world has never seen such massive sanctions.” Other media shows have also given an insight into the war casualties in Ukraine with Russian soldiers dying, which is also going against the official line that the battle is going according to plan.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

GHK broke the deadlock to score the first try of the game  minutes into the game, then missed the conversion.Mid Argyll then put together some great attacking plays and earned a penalty just outside the GHK -metre line.Inside centre Coll MacKay stepped up to score Mid Argyll#s first points of the campaign with a glorious conversion.  –  to GHK.GHK went on to score two more tries and one conversion # before disaster struck for Mid Argyll on the stroke of half time and with the score at  –  to GHK, as Wilson hobbled off with suspected knee ligament damage.With Wilson playing out of position in the front row, Mid Argyll had to reshuffle an already patchwork pack with Aaron McAllister moving from the wing to hooker and usual hooker Robbie Herd moving to prop.The new look front row finished off, Daniel Doherty doing well, as they held their own against an experienced opposition pack.Mid Argyll took time to settle into the new system, though, and GHK ran in two more converted tries.Mid Argyll almost produced the perfect reply when fly-half Logan Allen whipped a quick ball out to Gritten who, without actually catching the ball, flicked it on to Innes Patterson.Patterson beat two players and released Ed King-Venables who was caught by the GHK defence just short of the line.GHK ran the ball back up field but some great defensive play from flanker Gordon McLean, Self and MacArthur stopped them on the halfway line.A scrum to Mid Argyll saw scrum-half Calum Patterson pick the ball from the feet of McLean and, noticing a gap in the defence, broke through.He still had two more players to beat before he ran over the whitewash for Mid Argyll#s first try of the season # undoubtedly try of the match. MacKay converted for another two points and the score was  –  GHK.Having played with no subs, fatigue was starting to set in for the Argyll boys and with GHK using their subs they ran in a few more breakaway tries.Towards the end of the game GHK had one last attempt and broke through the Argyll defence, but from nowhere C Patterson found the determination and energy to chase the attacker down and fling out an arm to ankle tap him five metres short of the line and supporting was Lochlain Ellis to compete for the ball and earn Mid Argyll a deserved penalty.The final whistle sounded shortly after and the game finished  - to GHK.Mid Argyll enjoyed great hospitality from hosts GHK and Innes Patterson was awarded man of the match before the long journey home."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 3","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWhatever the rights and wrongs of Putin#s invasion of Ukraine, which has been shocking to witness from afar, one thing has shone through.The courage of the Ukranian people should serve as inspiration to each of us to stand against tyranny, in all its forms.As ever when the powerful invoke conflict, it#s the not-so-powerful and less wealthy who bear the brunt.

I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is.

Courier headlined #Show your garden some love this month#, and the suggestion of planting our own trees.So many trees are being cut down these days.I suggested to my husband, John, that we should buy each other a tree for Christmas and plant them in the garden of our new home.In fact, I ordered six – three each – dwarf fruit trees, due to high winds in Drumlemble, and we planted them in January.The apples are two x Golden Spur, two x Redspur and, pears are two x Lilliput Dwarf.With fruit trees, there is also the benefit of fresh fruit in years to come, either for us or future residents in our home.In response to Alex McKinven’s letter in the February  edition of the Courier titled ‘Any Dalintober developments must be sensitive’, hopefully I can give an assurance on behalf

tenants for a iety of reasons around layout and energy efficiency.ACHA is committed,demolition is permitted, to build  high-quality family homes, built sensitively in this outstanding seafront location.In reference to the gap sites at Saddell Street and Queen Street, ACHA does plan to bring these sites back in to community use and will consult on that in the very near future.That will be consistent with what we did when we demolished properties in central Campbeltown and replaced them with  family homes at New Parliament Place, Park Square, Longrow and McCallum Street.ACHA is committed as a partner of Argyll and Bute Council to do all we can to complete the direction of travel of regeneration in central Campbeltown over the last  years and we believe that our proposal for Dalintober and our consultation for Saddell Street and Queen Street will take that forward.My we and I have recently received from the pension service a note of our increase in the state pension from

look forward to a further increase in my state pension of  pence per week.Any suggestions as to what I should spend this welcome amount on Never mind, when the SNP and Greens obtain independence, they will be able to increase my pension from their abundant resources.Then again, all the SNP’s money trees have been blown down in the recent gales.Perhaps I should rely upon the Scottish Government

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a vegetable plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is your key to successful growing and means that you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and vegetable beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing directly into the ground at this time of year, there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option not only does it provide a warm environment for germination but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests.If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, then even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost-filled seed trays and then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost.If the seeds are big enough to handle, then you can sow them inidually into cm pots – the quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds, between five- seeds per pot.For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost-filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can then be planted outside tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill.You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots.Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and – handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots – gently tease them apart.Drop inidual seedlings into a cm compost-filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level.Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes.These can be planted from mid-March however planting times will y across the country, according to temperature and risk of frost.Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags.You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, and approximately cm deep and cm apart.Once stems are about cm tall, they will need earthing up – by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt – good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle – nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh Maris Bard – white flesh with good ‘new potato’ flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks.It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden."},{"url":null,"title":"cowal gathering set for 2022 return","story":"Nobody could have predicted at the end of the th Cowal Gathering in August  that it would be another three years before the sights and sounds of one of Scotland#s best family days out again would be experienced again.The event will be held from Thursday August  to Saturday August  and will feature a full programme including the World Highland Dancing Championships, the Cowal Pipe Band Championship and the Cowal International Heavy Athletics Championship.Live music fans will be well catered for as The Gig at the Gathering s to rock the Stadium on Cowal Gathering Friday night, before some of Scotland’s best-known traditional bandson Cowal Gathering Saturday to the Live Music Tent.Cowal Gathering chairperson Ronnie Cairns spoke of his excitement that the -year-old gathering will be live this year.#This is the best possible news and I can#t wait to welcome competitors and spectators from across the world through the gates of Dunoon Stadium this August,# he said.#While Cowal’s Virtual Gathering entertained thousands of gathering fans across the globe in  and , there is nothing that compares to the atmosphere of games day.#We’ve waited for three years to gather together again and this year we’re going to make sure we celebrate in style.#Full details of this year’s programme, competition entry and ticket sales will be available over the coming months.Visit www.cowalgathering or email info@cowalgathering for more information."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclist mark beaumont supports dambusters ride","story":"The - and -mile cycling event is raising money for the RAF Benevolent Fund, the RAF’s leading welfare charity.It consists of two elements: a virtual ride on the weekend of May -, and a physical #heritage ride# taking place in Lincolnshire on Saturday May .The event pays tribute to the Dambusters, members of the RAF’s  Squadron who were assembled to bomb three dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley on the night of May - .It was a risky raid, dropping the revolutionary bouncing bomb at low level, and the cost was high.

the previous weekend through a flurry of late goals, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils took the lead within the opening minute.Captain Keith Mitchell’s ball down the left channel found winger Scott Souden, who cut inside and rounded the far-advanced St Peter’s goalkeeper, way out of his penalty area, and tucked the ball home low from around  yards.The first half was a well-contested affair, with chances at both ends, with the Pupils’ Lewis McNaughton and Donald McCallum both going close with efforts at goal, while at the other end, St Peter’s continued to probe for an equaliser.This arrived just a few minutes before half-time, albeit in rather fortuitous circumstances, when a low shot from the visitors’ centre-forward from just inside the box evaded the grasp of keeper Alasdair Ferguson.Early into the second half, the Pupils found themselves - down after St Peter’s converted a penalty kick, skipper Mitchell having been adjudged to have brought down an onrushing midfielder.Souden then had a good chance double his and the Feather-sponsored Pupils’ goal tally after meeting Ryan Deans’ fine cross from the right-hand side of the box, but he couldn’t guide his cushioned header on target.The Pupils played the last  minutes of the match with  men when Jamie Burns was sent off for a tackle which was not malicious but was late.In believing that a goal-scoring opportunity had been denied, despite the foul taking place at least  yards from goal, the referee decided to show the Pupils defender a red card.This numerical advantage eventually paid off for the visitors in the closing minutes as a long throw-in was flicked on into a gaping space inside the box where a St Peter’s midfielder calmly side-footed a low right-foot shot into the net beyond Ferguson.It was a painful defeat for the Pupils, who acquitted themselves very well during the match and enjoyed spells of possession and pressure during the game, and in front of another healthy home crowd.However, their more clinical visitors took their chances when they arrived and managed to keep at bay most Pupils attacks in the second half to take all three points from Kintyre.Tomorrow , the Pupils host Glenvale FC, another Paisley side, in league action.Kick off is pm at Kintyre Park.

As the electric blade slowly descends on her face, Roz’s eyes suddenly fly open leaving us in suspense over her fate. In this jaw-dropping moment, Arnott and new recruit Georgia Trotman run to see the witness of the convoy ambush after Flemming spotted Denton making a call to the hospital where they were being treated. Arnott and Trotman see the witness being treated by a suspicious-looking nurse as they rush to the scene. Seeing through the wig and scrubs disguise, Arnott fights the assailant, later revealed to be bent copper Jeremy Cole, but is knocked out with a bed pan, leaving Trotman to fight alone. She is fatally overpowered by Cole and gives one last look of anguish before being thrown out the window to her death. Chilling. Who doesn’t love a redemption arc  After DI Lindsay Denton had been caught out for being a bent copper, she ended up helping Arnott with finding suspects in the Sands View Boys’ Home paedophile ring. As the story came to a head, she obviously had to die.Enter, bent copper Cotton.  After hacking into the email account of Danny Waldron to find a list of his abusers, she was tracked down by Cotton while at an internet café. Cotton then takes her to an industrial estate and holds her at gunpoint in his car where Denton redeems herself with an incredible self-sacrice.  With the list of Waldron’s abusers on her phone, she keeps her cool by stalling Cotton with a final speech, and just before he pulls the trigger sends the list to AC- and lines up Cotton’s eventual downfall. Martin Compston in action with Vicky McClureNo list of the most iconic Line of Duty moments would be complete without Martin Compston aka Steve Arnott. When “balaclava man” ambushes Arnott in the lt up to Nick’s office and smacks him unconscious with a baseball bat, we all feared the worst for our favourite copper.  And things certainly didn’t get any better when he was thrown down the stairs.  Eventually, it was revealed that Jimmy Lakewell and bent copper Derek Hilton were behind the attack. The incident continued to plague Arnott as he became addicted to painkillers, leading all of us singles to think “we can fix him”. The exclusive video will only be available to our subscribers.You can pay as little as £ for your first month and that fee will go directly to Martins favourite charity, Ardgowan Hospice.To sign up, visit our subscribe page here and take advantage of our latest amazing offers.Our exclusive recording of the event will be available to subscribers HERE from Thursday March .For those who already subscribe, you will also receive exclusive access to the video.Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time.If you would like to make a further donation to Ardgowan Hospice, you can do so HERE."},{"url":null,"title":"punk-belongs-brewdog-mcdonalds","story":"In  Corre burnt a chest full of punk memorabilia worth, he claimed, £ million That event is now the subject of a new film, Wake Up Punk, which receives its world premiere at the Glasgow Film Festival tomorrow night.In an interview with The Herald Magazine, Corre, the son of Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren, said punk has become a meaningless word which is now used to sell everything from hamburgers to car insurance.“Punk actually became a pose and it’s a pose today. It’s now a pose that belongs to Louis Vuitton, car insurance, BrewDog, McDonald’s and credit cards,” he said.Corre’s torching of memorabilia was seen by many as cultural vandalism at the time. But he hopes the film will explain his actions.“The point was to upset people and shock them out of their comfort zone and to ask themselves what they really value and why. And so, the point of burning it was to shock all these old punks out of their comfort zone, which is what it had become.”In a wide-ranging interview, Corre also talked about his relationship with his parents, his lingerie firm Agent Provocateur and his work as a political activist combatting fracking.Read the full interview in The Herald Magazine tomorrow"},{"url":null,"title":"gregor-townsend-urges-rule-rethink-world-rugby-wake-duhan-van-der-merwe-ban","story":"Van der Merwe will miss Scotland’s remaining two Six Nations matches after a disciplinary  handed down the ban for the red card he received while playing for Worcester Warriors in a Gallagher Premiership against London Irish. His place in the team to play Italy tomorrow has gone to Glasgow back Kyle Steyn.The announcement of the suspension came from the RFU, England’s governing body, but Townsend believes the issue needs to be claried at global level. He cited a try in which South Africa winger Makazole Mapimpi handed off two Japanese players as an example of what is and should be allowed, and contrasted that with the ruling that has deprived him of Van der Merwe. “I was really disappointed with the decision at the time, and I’ve been scratching my head ever since,” the Scotland coach said. “We’re allowed to hand off in the game of rugby. It’s in the law book and something we do from a young age. It’s something which is celebrated.“So you’re allowed to put your hand in someone’s face, in the head area. So for someone to attempt that at high speed against another player who is going at high speed, who is upright trying to tackle him, and execute it in the end but on the way to doing that his forearm touches that player’s face ...  “The fine margin for that, from something which would have been celebrated as a great hand-off, to be sent off from the game and you are not going to play for three weeks, is ridiculous in my view. And World Rugby need to come out with a statement and make a distinction between something which is legal and encouraged in the game, and not put attempted hand-offs in the same criteria as a high tackle or a dangerous ruck clear.“They [the English ] followed the head-contact process, but I think that is wrong in this situation,” he added. “We should be protecting the attacking player in a circumstance like that when he is up against someone trying to tackle him upright.“So, obviously we’re disappointed for Duhan. He’s very upset. But we’ll move on, and Kyle will go and grab his opportunity. But I have real questions about the game and what we’re trying to do here, when a hand-off to the face is allowed and encouraged.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snps-independence-project","story":"The SNP’s current excuse not to inflict a second, unnecessary, isive referendum on Scotland follows similar postponements because of Brexit and Covid. If a project has to be cancelled three times because it would be unwise, foolish and dangerous to proceed then it is reasonable to conclude the project is fundamentally flawed.If Scotland, truly was oppressed by being part of the United Kingdom and there was a genuine appetite by the majority to separate Scotland from family and friends in the rest of the United Kingdom then the SNP would proceed regardless of other factors.It is over for the SNP separation project. The United Kingdom will stay united.Bruce Halliday, Dumfries.NO RIGHT TIME FOR INDYREFRUTH Marris right to say that now is not the time to go for a second independence referendum. I would go further and say that there is no right time in the foreseeable future. The Ukraine crisis, along with pandemic recovery, climate change, Brexit fallout, NHS waiting lists, rampant inflation, ageing population, housing shortages and falling education standards are just some of the myriad problems governments and elected representatives will have to deal with at international, national and local level over the coming years and decades. They will all lead to more demand on council services and fewer financial resources to deal with them. Local council elections may seem trivial in comparison, but whatever your political views we should vote for candidates who are motivated by something other than separatist ideology. Use all your single transferable vote choices to elect people who will concentrate on solutions and not those who would add further distraction, complexity and uncertainty to an already dficult situation.Ms Marr quotes Martin Niemoller’s famous reasoning that bad things happen because “I did not speak out”. The council elections are our next chance to get our voices heard. Mark Openshaw, Aberdeen.FM SHOULD STAY OUT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRSYET again, Scotland’s First Minister simply cannot resist offering her opinion and even advice to Nato over the Ukraine crisis. She completely ignores the fact that she and her Government have no role to play in foreign affairs as this is not a devolved area of responsibility, but no matter, in she es again. Quite why those involved in the decision-making process within Nato would take a blind bit of notice of her “advice” is anyone’s guess, particularly when her “advice” is seriously misguided and potentially disastrous. Does she not believe that Nato would already have introduced a no-fly zone over Ukrainethis was practical  Does she not understand the implications of Nato forces shooting down Russian jets  All this from a First Minister and a party that not long ago wanted to leave Nato, still wants to remove nuclear weapons from Scotland and in effect be defenceless against any Russian aggression but of course then remain a beneficiary under the nuclear defence umbrella provided by Nato. Perhaps Ms Sturgeon might want to concentrate on everything in Scotland that is and has been broken under her watch.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.RUSSIA COULD GO NUCLEARTHE United States has intimated that Poland’s cunning attempt at mission creep around what is in effect a redeployment of its Mig-s to the USAF base at Ramstein in Germany has been, quite rightly, vetoed by the US.It ill behoves the First Minster to add her own to the voices suggesting that the option of a no-fly zone be kept on the table. A no-fly zone is precisely the sort of mission creep that could lead to a limited nuclear exchange. In case those who advise Ms Sturgeon on matters military have not pointed this out, tactical nukes in the Russian arsenal do exist. And as insane as it sounds, “escalate to de-escalate” is part of Russian doctrine.Bill Ramsay, Convener SNP CND, Glasgow.  "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13231893.jpg?type=article-full","title":"martin-compston-learning-gaelic-using-native-scottish-accent-tv","story":"Speaking to ITVs Lorraine, the actor also said he thinks using his native Scottish accent helps make his characters appear more charming.The star, originally from Greenock, is best known for playing the role of Detective Inspector Steve Arnott, who is English, in BBC drama Line Of Duty.He regularly disguises his strong accent for the characters he plays on TV, but his latest role, in ITV drama Our House, allows him to use his own accent.The -year-old, who plays Bram Lawson, told ITV’s Lorraine: “When you start a project like that, it’s just easier to use your own voice.”Our House follows Fi Lawson as she discovers that all of her belongings have been removed from her house and new occupants have moved in.The situation worsens when Fi is unable to contact her estranged husband, Bram, and their children.Compston described the show as “a classic ITV thriller – you know Suburbia, a bit creepy”.He also said he thinks the Scottish accent helps make characters appear more charming.“For Bram, on paper he does some terrible, terrible things so we kind of needed to make him charming and I think the Scottish accent kind of helps with that a wee bit,” he said.Speaking about his heritage, Compston said how happy he is to be a part of the forthcoming Amazon series The Rig.The show, which is due for release later this year, was filmed entirely in Scotland.He said: “It was great to work on something in Scotland with such ambition, so I’m excited for it.”Compston revealed that he got his Canadian co-star, Emily Hampshire, hooked on Irn-Bru – a Scottish carbonated soft drink – during the filming of the show.“She’s obsessed with soda, so she’s always got a diet Coke in her hand, so I said ‘look,you’re in Scotland and you’ve got a can of something in your hand all the time, it really should be an Irn-Bru’.“So I got her one to sip and she was hooked!” he said.Compston is also involved in making a new BBC documentary in Scotland, for which he said he is “tentatively learning Gaelic”.He told Lorraine: “We were talking about where does Gaelic sit in modern Scotland and then we took it to the BBC and it really evolved from there.“Just going around, meeting as many people as I can, seeing places, but really trying to find out what it is in modern Scotland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

That’s what we want to do every single game.“The  minutes against Palace was not good enough and our fans didn’t deserve that, like the gaffer said.“That’s how we want to play every single game, and we worked really well, and we’ll try to do that every match until the end, because that’s the way we like to play for our fans.”With  matches of the campaign remaining, Wolves remain eighth and on the cusp of the European places heading into Sunday’s trip to Everton, where they will again be without injured full-backs Ki-Jana Hoever and Nelson Semedo.Yet Neves insisted they are paying no attention to their place in the standings, merely taking one fixture at a time.“I know we are always saying the same thing, but it’s the truth, we go game by game,” he said. “We don’t look at the table, we look to ourselves, to the way we play, and the things we need to improve.“That’s our way to work, since I came here, and it’s been successful for us, thinking about the next match.”Neves courted the headlines for his th-minute finish against Watford, controlling the ball on the edge of the box before expertly lofting an inch-perfect finish over goalkeeper Ben Foster.“It was a good goal,” he added. “I practise it a lot in training to be honest. The goalkeepers don’t like it, it’s something that’s really hard for them, because the ball goes to the second post and they are never expecting that.”Lage has been particularly struck by his fellow Portuguese, adding: “This is the first time I’ve worked with Ruben and it’s a big pleasure. He wants to improve. He’s an amazing guy, a top player and deserves all the best.”"},{"url":null,"title":"kyle-walker-peters-urges-southampton-put-newcastle-defeat-behind  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Obviously be disappointed now, but tomorrow a clean slate and we go again on Sunday, because the games are coming fast and we want to climb as high as we can in the table.“That’s the beauty of football, the games come quick and on Sunday we could all be talking about how well we played and we get a win, so that’s what we’re going to focus on.

Negotiators even on Friday maintained that a road map was near for how the United States could rejoin the accord it unilaterally withdrew from in , and for Iran to again limit its rapidly advancing nuclear program.While Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, only referred to “external factors” forcing the pausing, it appeared the Russian demand caused the disruption.“The real issue for this pause here is what Russia has thrown on the table, which is essentially a grenade in the middle of the negotiations,” said Henry Rome, deputy head of research at the Eurasia Group who has been following the talks.Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he wanted “guarantees at least at the level of the secretary of state” that the US sanctions would not affect Moscow’s relationship with Tehran.A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors.A final text is essentially ready and on the table.As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement.— Josep Borrell FontellesMarch , While American officials sought to describe the demand as not related to the Vienna talks, matters swtly stalled on Friday with a tweet from Mr Borrell.“A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors. A final text is essentially ready and on the table,” Mr Borrell wrote. “As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement.”The JCPOA, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is the formal name of the  deal that saw Iran limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lting of economic sanctions.EU negotiator Enrique Mora met on Friday with Iranian officials before telling journalists that “we are almost there” with the talks.“Almost everything is done,” Mr Mora said. “We are almost at the limit of negotiating footnotes.”Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said the pause “could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue” ahead of restoring the deal.“Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all,” he wrote on Twitter. “No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement.”Mr Khatibzadeh did not identy the “external” issue — Iran has been careful in the waning days of the talks not to upset Russia, which it views as an ally against the US.Pause in #ViennaTalks could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue and a final .Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all.No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement. https:t.co pAblzGjhd— Saeed Khatibzadeh | سعید خطیب‌زادهMarch , A report by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, quoting an anonymous source it described as close to Tehran’s negotiators, also suggested Russia’s demands caused the pause.“There are some issues such as the issues between Russia and the United States, which, of course, will be unrelated to the issue of Iran’s talks … and that need to be resolved between the US and Russia,” IRNA quoted the source as saying.However, Russian Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, speaking to journalists outside of the Vienna hotel where the talks took place, insisted: “I’m not aware of any impasse.”“Contacts will continue,” he said. “The conclusion of the deal does not depend on Russia only.”Chinese Ambassador Wang Qun said negotiators “regret the pause” and added, “as we know, negotiation cannot be conducted in a political vacuum.”German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was key for the negotiation that there are “no attempts from outside to undo the success of these talks.”“For me it is very clear that it is also the job of powers such as Russia or China that they support these results constructively,” Mr Scholz said. vw,vw,px, px\"European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell On Thursday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price had said America was “close to a possible deal — it’s really down to a very small number of outstanding issues”.But he also warned America had “no intention of offering Russia anything new or specic as it relates to the sanctions”.However, British negotiator Stephanie Al-Qaq struck a more sombre note, warning on Friday on Twitter that the “external factors must be resolved in next few days or agreement likely to unravel”.The  nuclear deal saw Iran put advanced centruges into storage under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency , while keeping its enrichment at .% purity and its stockpile at only kg of uranium. It also halted enrichment at its underground Fordo nuclear facility.As of February , the IAEA says Iran’s stockpile of all enriched uranium was nearly ,kg. Some has been enriched up to % purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of %. Meanwhile, Iran has stopped the IAEA from accessing its surveillance camera footage and has resumed enrichment at Fordo.That has worried nuclear non-proleration experts.

It was a privilege and honor and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Hannah’s husband Robert passed away in  and she enjoyed  years of good health, but after a while Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time.

He also judges in the obedience and agility categories.Michaelis joined by his we Kate, also a judge, and their son Crawfordwho is competing in the show with his border collie Denny.The popular dog show was on a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic but just yesterday the National Exhibition Centre saw tens of thousands of dogs and their handlers arrive to show off their prized pooches.Owners and pets will see dogs from around the world compete in the agility and obedience competitions over the next three days, as well as the show dogs organised by breed, although only one can be named top dog on Sunday in the ‘Best in Show’ category.The Northern Ireland team consists of three border collies, three golden retrievers, a black Labrador and a Sheltie cross — all hoping for a rosette.“We have a really strong team this year, with some really great handlers,” he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “What makes a winner at the end of the day, is pairing the right dog with the right person —the partnership isn’t right you won’t be on to a winner. “Normally the weak link is the human when there is a mismatch like that,” he added.“The dog is always the strongest and always wants to do its best but being paired with the wrong handler is usually what lets them down.”As a show of support for the local team, the Irish Football Associationhave sponsored all the leads and collars for the competition, as well as providing the pampered pooches with their very own Northern Ireland jerseys through the Urban Pup brand.Both Michael and his we Kate are obedience and agility judges, with Kate being named one of only two accredited obedience stewards for the show this year.He said it is a “huge honour for someone this side of the water”.“Northern Ireland only has one vote in the competition, compared to Wales and Scotland that have two, and the Midlands alone have four votes, so you need to be in the know to get a say and to know what you’re doing, so it’s a benefit to have me and Kate there,” he said.Due to their unique combined skills, the husband and we duo are normally flown to dog shows all across the world to judge.“Not many can do both and so we’d normally be sent to shows in the likes of the Netherlands, all across Europe, Singapore and even Abu Dhabi,” he said.Michael pointed out that judging is “a passion” of theirs.“We do this for the love of it and have been doing this for about  years now, but we have been involved with dog training for a lot longer,” he said.The McCartney family have been running Glen Craig Canine Training for the past  years from their home in Lisburn, but Michael said his love of dog training started from a young age when he joined the original Belfast Dog Training Club in  at the age of .“The club was where the peace line is now, between the Shankill and the Falls Roads in west Belfast. But when the Troubles broke out, they had to close it,” he said.“I remember seeing the poster on the wall advertising one of their meetings and I brought my first dog — a collie Labrador cross called Cap — and that was me hooked on dog training, from I was a wee lad.”Michael’s son, Crawford, has followed in his father’s footsteps.He first got involved in the young Kennel Club at the age of seven and has been competing in events ever since.Crawford has represented Ireland at both the European and World Agility Championships in previous years and also for the upcoming  competition.Michael said that it’s important to start training a dog as a pup.“From eight to  weeks they are like a sponge and will just soak up all that information,” he said. “Dogs just want to please you at the end of the day, and that is what we need to remember in this competition, as long as they get the rewards and positive reinforcement that they are doing a good job, they will do you proud, and we hope that is the case this year.”Most ReadNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Famous Belfast landmark ‘the balls on the Falls’ features on The ChaseSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckTop VideosPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayHistorical abuse survivors rubbish apology from institutions but praise MLAsLatest Northern IrelandMask rule in Northern Ireland classrooms to be ltedMixed emotions as victims of institutional abuse finally get public apologyMinisters deliver long-awaited apology over historical institutional abuseIn quotes – the Institutional Historical Abuse apologyVictims urge: ‘Demonstrate atonement by contributing to redress fund’LatestJamal Edwards ‘did not see similarity between Sheeran song and another track’European markets climb on reports over Ukraine talks progressKyiv won’t be captured, says Ukrainian MP as Russia moves to surround capitalSimon Mayo and Mark Kermode to end  Live film review show after  yearsLack of ‘meaningful sanctions’ over Hong Kong sent ‘wrong message’ to China,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAuditor Kieran Donnelly, Credit: .Garrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe NI Audit Office has described the Department for the Economy’s failure to learn from the Renewable Heating Incentivescheme as “completely unacceptable” after highlighting a number of irregularities in its expenditure.Mr Kieran Donnelly, Comptroller and Auditor General , has issued reports on the results of his audits of the - annual report and accounts of the Department for the Economyand Invest NI .The reports summarise his assessment of both sets of accounts, which largely relate to grant support schemes launched in response to the Covid- pandemic.In -, DfE’s net expenditure totalled £. billion, a substantial increase from £. billion in -.INI’s net expenditure also increased by £. million to a total of £ million. This was largely due to the implementation of a number of emergency grant schemes, designed to provide support to businesses and iniduals subject to closure or restrictions.Mr Donnelly’s reports highlight four Covid schemes, totalling £ million, which, although recorded in Invest NI’s accounts, were actually controlled and administered by DfE. These include the Small Business Grant Scheme and the Tourism and Retail Sectors Grant.INI was instructed by the department to include the expenditure within its accounts as it had the correct legal powers to make the payments, whereas the department did not.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Donnelly concluded that INI had no role in the schemes’ design or delivery and that the schemes were actually administered by the department, meaning that the expenditure should have been recorded in the DfE’s accounts.It also means that the expenditure was incurred by DfE without the appropriate legal authority. As a result, he has qualied both sets of accounts on the basis that this expenditure was “irregular”.He also concluded that INI’s financial statements did not provide a true and fair view of the substance of the transactions and he has provided an adverse opinion on Invest NI’s accounts on that basis.Both the department and INI were provided with an opportunity to adjust their accounts to resolve the issues identied by the audit. They both declined to do so as they do not agree with the independent opinion of the CAG.This disagreement has, in part, contributed to the lateness of certication and publication of the annual report and accounts of both organisations.Mr Donnelly commented: “My report acknowledges the speed with which these support schemes were designed and delivered.“It is important to stress, though, that the issues I have identied do not merely pertain to technical matters, but to fundamental principles and standards of accounting with which all public bodies should comply.”The report also sets out the CAG’s qualication relating to Covid- business support schemes administered by Invest NI totalling £. million in -.Based on how these schemes were designed, INI relied on self-declarations by applicants as evidence that certain eligibility criteria had been met, with no corroborating evidence. As a result there was “insufficient audit evidence” to confirm that expenditure was regular.These schemes were launched at pace in response to the continued impact of the pandemic on Northern Ireland’s economy.Approval for their implementation was granted by Ministerial Direction, since the Department’s Accounting Officer was unable to provide evidence that these schemes would provide value for money or that there would not be an unacceptably high risk of error or loss of funds.In addition, Mr Donnelly’s report on INI notes “irregular income and expenditure” relating to a £. million loan made in previous years to Glenmore Generation Limited – an anaerobic digestion facility.The Department of Financeconsidered this loan to be irregular, because certain conditions of its approval had not been complied with and further approval had not been sought.Irregularities were also highlighted in relation to a £.m payment to Tourism Ireland Limited, where again DoF approval was not obtained.Commenting on these qualications to the accounts, Mr Donnelly said: “It is completely unacceptable that a Department fails to comply with the requirements of primary legislation it is relying on to make payments.“This is a basic requirement, and it is extremely disappointing to see that the Department has failed to learn lessons from its past failure on obtaining approvals required for the Renewable Heating Incentive scheme.”INI published its - Annual Report  Accounts on Wednesday. They say the accounts have been qualied by the NI Audit Office in two areas – expenditure relating to NI Executive Covid emergency response schemes and expenditure relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility.Responding to the qualications Mel Chittock, Interim CEO, Invest NI said: “We acknowledge the decision of the Comptroller and Auditor General to qualy our accounts.“The global pandemic was an unprecedented situation which required implementation and operation of emergency schemes outside of normal process.“I am confident that all the necessary steps were taken to provide the best solutions to get much needed emergency funding to businesses. We complied fully with the instructions given to us and NIAO found no irregularities.”Addressing the qualication relating to a loan provided for the Glenmore Anaerobic Digestion Facility in more detail, she said under the Sustainable Utilisation of Poultry LitterScheme INI provided funding towards the build and operation of two anaerobic digestion plants.“The aim was to help resolve a signicant local environmental issue and to help Northern Ireland comply with EU nitrates targets, as well as provide economic benefits by supporting growth in the agri-food sector,” Ms Chittock said.“It was always understood that the development of anaerobic digestion plants using innovative technologies was high risk. This risk was balanced against the environmental and economic benefits to the NI economy.“The Glenmore facility encountered technical and operational dficulties and in  the owner operator decided to refinance the business. As a result, Invest NI, and the main funder, will not receive aon the initial investment made.“However, the plant remains operational, is contributing to the objectives of the SUPL Scheme, and producing green energy for two NI manufacturing businesses.”A review highlighted that there could have been improvements in Invest NI internal processes and that it could have taken more steps to better mitigate and manage the loan investment in this project.However, the Department of Finance concluded that some of the conditions it put in place around the loan were not met, and now views the loan as an irregular spend.INI insists that it has tightened its processes and procedures and formed a new Invest NI Governance Council focussed on implementing best practice and improvements right across the organisation.A DfE spokesperson said as the Covid crisis gripped the country, the department and its arm’sbodies responded immediately, with  schemes delivered at a cost of £m. which helped tens of thousands of local businesses.It is therefore disappointing, and not for the first time, that the Department is forced to clary its position following an NIAO report,” he added.“The Department’s accounts were presented to the NIAO in May , as agreed. A delay arose because of the NIAO’s interpretation of an accounting issue it had not raised the previous year when the same schemes were delivered.Despite obtaining extensive and robust legal advice supporting its approach, the Department was unable to persuade the NIAO of its position a position that was universally accepted and supported across Government.The Department’s Accounting Officer shared his legal opinion and wider supporting documentation with the NIAO in an attempt to agree a consensus. Unfortunately, a resolution to what was, and remains, a subjective issue in accounting terms, prevented the accounts from being laid on time as anticipated.”Most ReadNorthern Ireland man dies on Ben NevisHeating oil firms facing abuse and tears as prices soarExplainer: Will you save money by using an electric heater to warm up a room Famous Belfast landmark ‘the balls on the Falls’ features on The ChaseSuzanne BreenOpinion‘The look on Denis Donaldson’s face wasn’t even shock’ night hit team struckTop VideosPlayHistorical abuse survivors rubbish apology from institutions but praise MLAsPlayVideo: Ukrainian soldiers use Northern Ireland built NLAW on invading Russian tanksPlayTwo Ukrainian men defuse bomb with bare hands and a bottle of waterLatest Northern IrelandMask rule in Northern Ireland classrooms to be ltedMixed emotions as victims of institutional abuse finally get public apologyConcern as Education Authority hit by school cleaning staff shortageMinisters deliver long-awaited apology over historical institutional abuseIn quotes – the Institutional Historical Abuse apologyLatestAlex Hales pulls out of upcoming Indian Premier League citing ‘bubble fatigue’Don’t play politics – Paul Canoville demands Cha are sold ‘without delay’Davey stands by call for Johnson to go as he says public need PM they can trustTuesday finish possible at Players Championship as rain wreaks havoc to scheduleFrank Lampard thinking of friends at Cha in ‘tough moment’ for former club,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the UK government has issued a general licence that permits Cha FC to continue certain activities.We will fulfil our men’s and women’s team fixtures today against Norwich and West Ham, respectively, and intend to engage in discussions with the UK government regarding the scope of the licence. This will include seeking permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the club to operate as normal as possible.

True, our sportsmen, sportswomen and teams gave us much to cheer about and lted our hearts at times when there was little to celebrate. Sport did indeed keep going in the midst of adversity. But, looking back as an on-the-spot reporter, the notion of sport as an oasis of peace and harmony is just a tad revisionist.My job on the sports desk of the Belfastdid indeed seem normal compared to the work of my news-desk colleagues, who recorded more deadly scores as the body count mounted. But every now and then tensions on the streets spilled on to the terraces and sport migrated to the front pages for all the wrong reasons.My own personal baptism of fire arrived just two months into my Tele career, ignited by that bloody August Bank Holiday Monday of . Twenty-three people had died: four in the attack on Lord Mountbatten’s fishing boat off the Sligo coast eighteen soldiers in a double blast at Narrow Water, near Warrenpoint, all at the hands of the Provos and, largely forgotten, a curious English visitor, drawn to the water’s edge on the southern side of Carlingford Lough by the first blast at Narrow Water, who was shot dead by a panicking trooper who mistook him for one of the bombers. In the midst of the madness unleashed that sunny day, with community tensions stretched like piano wire and emotions off the scale, someone in the upper echelons of European football – and likewise the security services on both sides of the border – thought it a good idea to send Linfield to Dundalk, which is a few miles across the border in the Republic of Ireland, two days later for a European Cup tie. Talk about quenching flames with petrol.Context is everything for those born in the ensuing decades. Today, a Dundalk–Linfield game would not raise an eyebrow, let alone the state of high alert that accompanied the fixture in . Back then, Linfield was an exclusively Protestant team and club, drawing its support from staunch loyalist areas. The first Catholic players did not arrive until the s. Today, the team is fully inclusive. Dundalk at that time would have been a safe haven for on-the-run republicans and their sympathisers. A combustible mix at the worst of times. The events of that Bank Holiday Monday made the violence that would erupt inside and outside Oriel Park two nights later an absolute certainty – the blood was up – and still it was allowed to go ahead.Knowing what was going to happen, we journeyed like moths to a flame: our boss Malcolm Brodie in the driving seat of his Honda Accord automatic colleagues Bill Ireland, Gordon Hanna and me, his passengers. Three great newspaper men and sports writers, sadly no longer with us, and me, too young and foolish to be apprehensive and for whom the trip seemed like a great adventure. The reports they filed that night were never going to be about football. The normally bustling Dundalk we arrived in that afternoon was a ghost town, with the owners of pubs and shops hastily pulling down their shutters as word reached them of a pub wrecked by a busload of Linfield supporters in nearby Ravensdale. There wasn’t a Blueman in sight when we got there, but an advance party had clearly arrived as a Union Jack was fluttering from the Maid of Erin statue in Market Square. It was the calm before the storm.A blind man on a galloping horse could have seen the violence coming. Three thousand Linfield fans in a fleet of sixty buses descended on the border town where the local hoods were waiting, ready to defend their title. Gardaí, some not even in riot gear, were hopelessly unprepared, and outnumbered. Undisciplined stewards – bizarrely clad in white coats and resembling cricket umpiresDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up – attempted to drive back the rampaging Linfield hordes using wooden cudgels but were overrun. Worse still, the section housing the away fans was strewn with rubble that ought to have been cleared, completely negating the point of the police searches at the turnstiles. And a thin line of barbed wire was all that separated the goading Dundalk fans and police line from the snarling Linfield mob, who chewed it up and spat it out as they launched their attacks.An estimated  to  of the ,-plus Linfield supporters were involved in the violence, but, fuelled by drink and anger, they generated the sound and fury of ten times their number. However regular fans later asserted that many of these ‘supporters’ had never been to a Linfield match before.Unbelievably, at the outset, gardaí clodded stones back at them! The police baton-charged again and again but were driven back under the unreserved stand before calling in reinforcements. The trouble continued, despite appeals over the PA system by Dundalk and Linfield officials, and by Bluemen in the stands who were not involved in the violence and who tried to remonstrate with the mob. An uneasy peace settled, particularly after Warren Feeney scored the opening Linfield goal – though immediately after it, full back Terry Hayes was felled by a stone thrown from the Dundalk end. But more trouble was to develop. A tricolour was set alight at the Linfield end and, in response, the Dundalk crowd ripped up and burned a Union Jack.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn injured garda is led away from the pitch FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn injured garda is led away from the pitchComing up to half-time, the violence worsened, with more stone-throwing and more baton charges. However, at this stage, the gardaí appeared to be settling for a policy of trying to reason with the fans – at that stage they made no arrests and allowed the Linfield supporters not involved in the trouble to keep things under control.That plan soon broke down, however, and all hell was let loose during half-time, with vicious fighting, and Linfield fans up on the roof of the stand trying to remove the tricolour that was flying at full mast. Injured gardaí, many with blood streaming down their faces, were helped out of the ground and some stewards were also among the casualties. So, too, were a number of Linfield fans who had been arrested. We saw one dragged by police through the tearoom with blood gushing from a head wound.Dundalk officials continued to make appeals for order over the loudspeaker: ‘You are doing your club no good. Please stop firing missiles,’ they pleaded, to no avail. Later, when the teams took the field again, some of the Linfield players, led by their player-manager Roy Coyle, walked straight to the Linfield section involved in the violence and pleaded for order. Legendary captain Peter Rafferty and Feeney, scorer of Linfield’s goal, also appealed. Rafferty said afterwards, ‘There was one boy, and the smell of drink from his breath nearly made me drunk. Quite honestly, I’ve never seen any of those people at Windsor Park before.’They settled, but not for long. One fan climbed up on to the roof of the ground, and again tried to pull down the tricolour. He was tackled by a steward, who pelted the youth with stones and then retreated. And that was more or less the prelude for a big baton charge from gardaí. About three hundred of them rushed forwards, stepped over the barbed wire, which had been practically pulled asunder, and drove the Linfield fans back. More stones rained down on them, but they pushed on, driving the rioters back into the vast section of Linfield fans not involved, and who had earlier howled their disapproval of it all.At one stage, stewards rushed across the pitch while the game was continuing, but renowned referee Pat Partridge hardly noticed it. Meanwhile, behind the Linfield goal, the supporters were being driven back further and further into one corner.The casualty and arrest list by this time had increased signicantly. Order of Malta members had set up an impromptu First Aid room under the main stand before the ambulances arrived. Then the trouble spilled outside into Carrick Road. Three houses, a supermarket and a filling station were attacked and had windows smashed as the Linfield fans made their way back to the buses taking them home, parked up by the Harp brewery. The buses, too, were attacked, with more windows broken. Several had been smashed on the way to Dundalk as well, injuring some Linfield supporters.Meanwhile, in the Dundalk boardroom after the game, Linfield secretary Derek Brookes condemned the violence and, in particular, the troublemakers clad in blue. Their conduct, he said, had disgraced the club. ‘Unfortunately,’ said Mr Brookes, ‘they ignored our appeals for order, and Roy Coyle did his best as well. Fortunately, the hooligans were greatly outnumbered by genuine fans, and the game itself was played in a magnicent spirit. There was hardly a serious foul.’ Dundalk chairman Oliver Quinn said he was ‘sad and disappointed’. Referee Partridge said he wanted to make no comment, and neither would the UEFA observer at the match, Leo Callaghan from Wales. ‘It’s all here in my notes,’ he said. ‘But I don’t want to say anything. I’ll be making my report.’That report resulted in Linfield being held almost entirely accountable, being forced to pay Dundalk’s costs to travel to the Netherlands as well as an additional £, for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined £ for providing insufficient security at the match. In an ironic postscript, Dundalk went on to defeat Maltese minnows Hibernians in the next round before drawing Celtic. The events of that night forty-two years ago in Dundalk showed Belfast would not have been ready for a match like that had it been Linfield who progressed.When order was finally restored as the Blue hordes left a shattered town, the ‘score’ was:  gardaí hurt  civilians injured, including  Linfield fans and a girl who remained in hospital the next day and  arrests made – mostly Linfield supporters, who appeared in court the next day and were fined.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and RTE journalist Charlie Bird with Ivan Little and Deric Henderson during the launch of Reporting the Troubles  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and RTE journalist Charlie Bird with Ivan Little and Deric Henderson during the launch of Reporting the Troubles And while the match itself yielded a £, ‘gate’, the Dundalk club revealed that the cost of staging the match, and paying for the damage would wipe out their profit. Linfield paid a high price, too, and not just reputational. UEFA chiefs quickly decided the club should carry the can for their supporters’ actions and ordered theleg to be played in Haarlem, Holland. Amid it all, a football match broke out, a credit to every player on the pitch and, fittingly, it ended in a – draw, Dundalk progressing with a – win, where Linfield’s goal scorer at Oriel Park, Warren Feeney, missed a penalty.That riot in  was by far the worst I have witnessed in a football ground in forty-two years chronicling the game here, and there have been many: the battle on the pitch at the end of the  Linfield–Glentoran Irish Cup final at Windsor the  final between the same clubs at which burning rafters rained down from inside the roof of the unreserved stand at The Oval Linfield–Donegal Celtic in  Cltonville–Celtic in the week of the internment anniversary in , when fans fought running battles with police who fired plastic bullets inside the ground, and when a service revolver was snatched and later used to murder an off-duty UDR soldier and the murder of reserve police officer David Purse, who was on duty at a Crusaders match at Seaview in . And so it went on through the s and s, the almost routine football disorder a microcosm of a violent and ided society.The fact that Dundalk has played without incident at Windsor in recent years shows how far most of us have come in the long, drawn-out decades of peace- and confidence-building since. And that has to be the biggest blessed relief of all.Jim Gracey was group sports editor of Belfast  Sunday Le, and spent over forty years reporting on local, national and international sport, including five football World Cups.

Matthew Martin played around several Bangor defenders and looked to pass up to Jason Campbell up front, who got into some promising positions.However, it was Bangor who broke the deadlock following a cross to the back post to take the lead.Play continued with both teams creating chances but neither were able to add to the scoreline before the end of the quarter.Bangor continued to apply pressure on lsquoHinch from the start of the second but the home side managed to manufacture counterattacks.lsquoHinch were playing the ball down the wings to Adam Dodds and Ross Connolly.Leslie Harrison played the ball out from the back to Andrew McIlwaine, only to be dispossessed by the Bangor defence.Play became end to end with teams trying to keep possession but unable to do so.

While museums are about objects, those objects have no signicance without people.People make things for particular purposes they use them, they value them, they discard them, they contemplate them. Museums try to understand objects in order to reach the peoplebehind them, understand their lives and so add meaning to our own.Local museums are concerned with all aspects of their communities. Their collections represent the inheritance, the culture, and the trust of their communities.Down County Museum has the largest collection of objects relating to farming in Ulster outside the national museums.Through the generosity of iniduals and families it has acquired not only the complete equipment of two of the last horse-powered farms in the county but a fine example of an early Ferguson tractor, with an invention which not only revolutionised agriculture but brought recognition to its County Down inventor throughout the world.A host of other items represent the history of a basic industry and developing way of le in County Down, from a wooden plough from Mourne to a donkey-powered milk churn from Ballyroney to the first reaper and binder in the area, to hay sweeps, rakes and potato diggers, scythes, rope twisters, turnip cutters, barn fans, churns, butter pats, sheep shears, horse harness, slipes, carts, Young Farmersrsquo Club trophies and records, and valuable medals given for agricultural improvements on the iable soils of County Down.We should not forget that we build on what has gone before and that is as true of our most important industry as of any other.One object which is almost entirely forgotten was the block-wheeled car, with solid wooden wheels, which was the ubiquitous load carrier before the introduction of the large-wheeled lsquoScotch cartrsquo in the s.The agricultural census of  recorded  of these lsquocarsrsquo in the  townlands of the south Ards alone.

","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest secured their spot in the semi-final stages of the Harry Clarke Cup after they dramatically defeated a favoured Ardglass side on Saturday.Despite trailing by two goals with less than five minutes left on the clock, Forest managed to force extra-time, and then penalties, following a bizarre conclusion to the  minutes that ended with a red card and a fairytale finish.Sean Dornan was the hero between the sticks in the shootout after saving two separate Ardglass efforts while converting his chance from the spot for good measure.To add further to the drama, Dornan was initially outfield for Forest before swapping positions with lsquokeeper Brian McVeigh a minute before the final whistle of extra-time sounded.It was a sunny yet bitterly cold Ardglass venue but that didnrsquot deter things from immediately heating up on the pitch as both teams sought to gain the upper hand early.However, it was the home side who would take the lead within the opening ten minutes when striker Michael Magee struck the ball into the net from close range.This lead would be short-lived as the visitors penned Ardglass back into their own half and soon Castlewellan were rewarded for their relentless attacking.A quickly played pass across the box was met by Forest forward Shane Mooney, who made no mistake with his right footed finish beyond the outstretched arms of Ardglass custodian Mark Armstrong.Chances followed for the visitors, including a Sean Dornan effort that cracked the outside of the post from range and an opportunity for striker Scott Kinley, which quickly diminished after he took too much time on the ball.However, Ardglass refused to be bullied for a prolonged period of time from a side a ision below in the Newcastle League and often launched some dangerous looking counterattacks.One such breakaway ended with Shane Teggart earning his Ardglass side a corner which led to a goalmouth scramble before the ball was headed off the line and away from danger.Ardglass began to find their feet and found more success up front thanks to the probing runs of marksman Magee, who was giving the Castlewellan defence plenty to think about.The Ardglass number nine was unfortunate to see his free-kick effort saved at the second time of asking, but he did give his side the chance to go in front when his nty footwork inside the Forest box resulted in a mistimed tackle and a penalty awarded.Stephen Deegan stepped up a coolly dispatched the spot kick, sending Castlewellan custodian Brian McVeigh the opposite direction in the process.Castlewellan continued to battle with Donagh Steele in the middle of the park having a particularly notable performance as he chased down every loose ball available.Despite their good work, Forest may count themselves fortunate not to go into the break further behind as the usually clinical Magee fluffed his lines from ten yards, missing a golden opportunity for Ardglass.The drama of the first half carried onto the second and in a matter of minutes the referee was forced to make another potentially game changing decision.Once again, the hosts released Magee into the danger area although this time he had Castlewellan captain Aidan Dornan hot on his heels.The move ended with Magee on the ground with his hands in the air appealing for a penalty, however, this time appeals were swtly waved off.The contest quickly turned into a feisty affair as Ardglass looked to overrun their counterparts by sending bodies forward in waves of attacks.Jordan Finnegan saw his snapshot smartly saved by Forest lsquokeeper McVeigh before strike partner Magee saw another one of his efforts tipped wide by the impressive Castlewellan number one.Midway through the half Castlewellan were afforded a seldom opportunity, but Sean Dornan opted to pass when he maybe should have tried his luck at goal instead.Soon after, a punt upfield from the Ardglass defence evaded the heads of the opposition, including lsquokeeper McVeigh, and almost resulted in a rather comedic goal.However, the Castlewellan defence recovered just in the nick of time to avoid any red faces.With  minutes left of the , Ardglass would finally add to their tally after a sumptuous dead ball delivery from Neil Teggart lofted onto the head of team-mate Malachy Crangle, who directed his effort into the net.Castlewellan knew the clock was against them but firmly pushed for a way back into the tie. Rossa McCartan was introduced to the fray off the bench in what proved to be a decisive move from Castlewellan head coach Conall Burns.With a minute of regulation time to go, McCartan danced his way down the line and into the Ardglass box where he was adjudged to be brought down unfairly.Forest striker Mooney converted the penalty to notch his second goal of the match but there was little belief from the surrounding spectators that there would be enough time for another opportunity.In what was seemingly one last throw of the dice, Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick inside their own half and players gathered at the edge of the opposing -yard line waiting for the delivery.However, before the free-kick could be taken, some roughhousing from both sides would end with Ardglass substitute Aidan Watson being shown the red card after he seemingly lost his discipline and kicked out at the opposition.A bizarre series would follow, as the initial free-kick was then brought forward to the -yard line where Watson committed his foul, and from here Castlewellan would take full advantage.Sean Dornan struck his lowly driven effort beneath the jumping Ardglass wall, and goalkeeper Mark Armstrong could only momentarily ert the ball away from goal before the onrushing Callum McCabe would tap-in to draw the sides level.With that, the final whistle of regulation time was blown and extra-time was set to commence.To both sidersquos credit, the intensity of the match remained but neither manufactured any real clear cut chances.Ardglass striker Magee picked up a yellow card but the most notable move of extra-time came from the Castlewellan management, whoopted to swap midfielder Sean Dornan for goalkeeper McVeigh a minute before the penalty shootout.This would prove decisive as Dornan broke Ardglass hearts and saved two penalties, giving his Castlewellan side a memorable victory and place in the last four of the Harry Clarke Cup.Following the dramatic encounter, Dornan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe were low on numbers coming down here and we probably werenrsquot as strong as we could be, he said.ldquoBut the credit has to go to the boys, we worked hard and it worked out for us.ldquoWe went - down but we battled hard, got a penalty and a fluky goal.He added: ldquoThe Harry Clarke Cup is blown wide open, Ardglass was probably the favourites and we knocked them out so itrsquos anyones now.Ardglass: M Armstrong, C Kearney, M Crangle, N Teggart, C OrsquoShea, M Rooney , S Deegan, SP Halpin, M Magee, J Finnegan, S Teggart.Subs: S Dorrian, A Watson, J Deegans, A OrsquoShea.Yellow card: M MageeRed card: A WatsonCastlewellan: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, A Dornan , D Gilmore, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, S Kinley, J Murnin.Subs: C McVeigh, R McCartan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  March 11%2C 1992  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK ndash Work has begun on the first phase of a major agricultural marketing centre for the Downpatrick area.Diggers moved in this week to begin excavating a ten-acre site for a co-operative project which is being seen as essential to the future of the local farming community.A pound, livestock mart will form the first stage of an ambitious scheme by the Downpatrick Co-Operative Marketing Centre, a limited company which has been set up by more than  local farmers.A covered sale yard and ancillary buildings on the Bonecastle Road site are expected to be finished in time for trading to begin by late July.

There will also be new footpaths, lighting and drainage.None of the statutory agencies have objected to the local authority proposal, but concern was expressed by one resident about the anti-social behaviour of young drivers using the car park.Recommending that the council proposal should be approved, planners said the current overspill car park is considered to be site a ldquosufficient distance from adjacent dwellings to prevent ldquoany unacceptable impacts.Planners say taking into account planning policy, consultee responses, planning history and responses, approval is recommended, also stipulating that prior to any work starting, a final drainage assessment, including a detailed drainage network design and demonstration of how so-called out-of-sewer flooding will be addressed, must be agreed with them.No retained trees will be allowed to be felled or uprooted as part of the work to provide the new parking spaces.Planners have also warned that care will need to be taken during the construction phase to ensure there are no polluting discharges.The contractor appointed to provide the new spaces must submit a so-called final construction method statement and that work cannot begin until approval is in place for the discharge of storm water from the development site has been secured from the Rivers Agency. A final drainage assessment must also be submitted.Protection zones for badger setts in the area must be established, with all trees and hedgerows retained with no external lighting provided until a lighting plan has been submitted to planners and approved.Local politicians are pleased that the main car park in Newcastle is to be extended which will make a dference during the busy holiday periods.They say there will be aon the local authorityrsquos signicant investment to provide additional parking for visitors and residents in the resort.Previously, the overflow area for cars at the rear of Donard Park has been described as ldquounsightly and particularly dficult to manage in wet weather, with the extension providing a modern parking facility to meet the needs of a range of drivers.Itrsquos also understood that the overspill car park may include a number of charging points for electric vehicles..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Newcastle ‘needs and deserves’ new centre  ","story":"A DETAILED report on building a new multi-million pound leisure centre in Newcastle is expected to be completed shortly.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials are working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for the eagerly-awaited new complex, with councillors expected to be provided with a copy of the report within the next few weeks.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be demolished to make way for the new town centre leisure complex, with formal planning approval to send in the bulldozers expected to be rubber-stamped at todayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Once the demolition work has been completed, the rear of the Newcastle Centre will be restored to its original design, with two sash windows reinstated to match those of the original building.In addition, alterations will be carried out to the boundary wall, alongside the removal of a reinforced concrete fence  and metal gates. The gates will be replaced with a perforated double metal gate.Planners say the removal of the ldquobulky rear extension to the existing listed building can only be seen as a betterment to its integrity and intrinsic character ldquo.In addition, they say the demolition proposal does not ldquooffend the essential character of the building with its setting retained and its features of special interest remaining intact and unimpaired.Planners have also stipulated that any proposed demolition work proposed within one metre of the Newcastle Centre shall be carried out by hand and that no power tools must be used to ensure no damage to the existing building.The proposed new leisure complex will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.Itrsquos also understood that the eagerly-awaited new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which enjoys protected status, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Late last year, it was revealed that an economist and team of expert consultants would be appointed to design the new leisure facility, with Newry, Mourne and Down Council adding an additional pound, to its capital programme to help deliver the new complex.The planned investment at the current Newcastle Centre housed in the Annesley Buildings is also a key plank of the local authorityrsquos capital investment programme.Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, said it was well known that Newcastle ldquoneeds and deserves a fit-for-purpose leisure centre.She said while the local authority has faced many hurdles over recent years in delivering a new leisure complex, all Mournes councillors understand there are no longer any available sites within the town which are of a suitable size to build what is needed.But Cllr Devlin said this could not be used as an excuse, highlighting the need to deliver for the people of town and visitors.ldquoThe council is proceeding with plans for a replacement centre on the current Newcastle Centre site, she continued. ldquoFrom the outset of this process I have said that this must include a pool and that remains my position.ldquoI appreciate there are swimming pools within the district butwe are serious about tourism we need to look at a rainy day offering in Newcastle and I believe that a pool would tick that box, as well as providing a superb facility for our local community.Cllr Devlin said she looks forward to forward to seeing the outline business case and the eagerly-awaited project progressing at long last.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion.Two sites were previously identied for the new centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option. However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School site at nearby Shanslieve Drive but lost out in a bidding war to supermarket giant Lidl.Local politicians say they are keen to see progress on the new leisure complex and are pleased that it will now include an indoor pool as residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Jack to embark on sky jump in memory of aunt  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE man will jump out of a plane from , feet to raise money for a childrenrsquos cancer charity.Jack Welshhas decided to take the plunge in memory of his aunt Joanne, who sadly passed away in .Going one step further in his fundraising efforts, the full-time barber is also opting to completely shave his head in a bid to raise even more money for his chosen charity, Cancer Fund for Children.ldquoI have been wanting to do something like this for a while so I thought I would just go for it, said Jack.ldquoMy aunty is the main inspiration behind the jump and I feel like the chosen charity is definitely a worthwhile one.ldquoMy family couldnrsquot be any more supportive, they are behind me all the way so that helps spur me on as the big day approaches.Jack will take to the skies on Saturday, March , and will also shave his head on the same day.

We are interested in solutions and putting people first and the Fishing and Seafood Development programme is one solution we must deliver on.ldquoI hope voters will remember issues such as this in May as they will be the people who elect a new Executive.Cllr Curran said the fishing and fish processing industries were an essential part of le in Ardglass and the local economy.ldquoThese industries must be protected and enhanced and this is all achievable, he declared.ldquoIt is welcome news that approval has been given for the programmersquos strategic outline case which allows DAERA to procure consultants to take forward detailed environmental and technical studies.ldquoHowever, this approval only allows DAERA to incur expenditure on work required to inform the later outline business cases upon which any later decisions to proceed with infrastructure development, such as the deepening of Ardglass harbour will be based.Cllr Curran said he hoped that the absence of the NI Executive and the uncertainty of its future does not obstruct the progress of the ldquovital fishing programme which offers so much potential for Ardglass and other local ports..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Regional rates frozen for business owners  ","story":"BUSINESSES and ratepayers have received some good news with confirmation that the regional rate has been frozen for another year.The decision by Stormont finance minister Conor Murphy is part of a poundm province-wide rates support package for the new financial year.He has also confirmed that the small business rate relief scheme benefiting thousands of business premises will also continue, explaining the message from businesses is that the rates holiday was a vital leline for them during the pandemic.The finance minister said the poundm rates support package to support the recovery will provide all businesses with a one month rates holiday with the exception of utilities and larger food stores while retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare, newspapers and airports will receive a three months rates holiday.Mr Murphy said businesses in the hardest hit sectors had paid no rates since March  and will now pay no rates until July.He said freezing the regional rate is intended to help with the rising costs being faced by families and businesses alike, with the extension of the small business rate relief scheme resulting in businesses automatically receiving a reduction of between % and % on their rates.The finance minister added: ldquoSmall businesses are at the core of our local economy and have a vital role in contributing to employment opportunities.ldquoI am glad to announce the continuation of the small business rate relief scheme which currently supports almost , business premises. The extension of the scheme sends a strong message of the important contribution of the small business sector.Last month, Newry, Mourne and Down Council imposed a .% rates rise to finance its poundm budget, with the hike the second lowest increase of any of the provincersquos  local authorities.Rates are made up of two parts mdash the regional rate and the district rate.The regional rate is set by Stormont and, along with the block grant from the Treasury, pays for the likes of schools, health and roads. The district rate is set by local councils and pays for services that the council is responsible for, such as refuse collection, leisure provision and street cleaning.While councils have the power to set dferent rates increases for households and businesses, this year they have chosen to instead set one percentage increase for both.Domestic and non-domestic rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable valuation of homes and businesses by the combined district and regional rate.Domestic and non-domestic rates are set in terms of the number of pence in each pound of the value of your home business. For instance, in the Newry, Mourne and Down council area, the domestic rate for the   financial year is . pence, while the non-domestic rate will be . pence.Key factors that councils have to take into account when setting their district rate, including cost of living, inflation, the councilrsquos own financial reserves and other income, and the wider economic outlook.Last year, several councils chose to freeze their rates due to the impact of the pandemic, dipping into their reserves to absorb the loss of income. Others chose to raise their rates slightly, however this has meant playing a degree of catch-up this year, when all councils have opted to hike their rates.As a result of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos rates increase, local communities are set to share a poundm funding boost in the new financial year.The organisation said it recognises that communities have been hit hard over the past number of years, outlining plans for poundm of financial assistance grants for community and voluntary organisations.In addition, the local authority will also manage the establishment of the Peace Plus Partnership as well as the submission and delivery of the Peace Plus Local Authority Action Plan worth around poundm.The action plan will provide priority projects on a cross-community basis, resulting in shared and inclusive local services, facilities and spaces and make a ldquosignicant and lasting contribution to peace and reconciliation for the whole community.In addition, pound.m will be invested on a new fleet of over  modern and more efficient vehicles across a range of services including refuse collection, district cleansing and parks and grounds maintenance with the new vehicles expected to arrive before the end of this year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Sense have been at  the core of Páuric’s  development and they have done a lot for us  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman braved the winds and rain last month to walk  miles in aid of the disability charity, Sense.Janine Laverty was inspired to take on Sensersquos Run For challenge to give back to the charity which supports her disabled son.So far Janine has raised an amazing total of over pound, through her challenge, but she is aiming to raise pound, in total.Participants challenged themselves to run or walk a distance of their choosing over the month of February.Janine finished her -mile target on February , completing her challenge with a seaside walk.She undertook the walk to support the charity which has meant so much to her family since her youngest son Paacuteuric, , was born premature and has cerebral palsy, developmental delay and dficulties with his vision.Family and friends have rallied around Janine , joining her on walks and generously donating to Sense.Sense services in Northern Ireland have supported Paacuteuric since he was an infant, providing key interventions such as play therapy, music therapy and guide dog days which boosted his development.Janine also credits Sense with providing some of her most precious family memories support from the charity allowed her to take both her sons swimming at the same time, and the family have attended fun-filled Sense days out to places including Ark Open Farm, Armagh Planetarium and Jungle Northern Ireland.Janine explained: ldquoSense Northern Ireland have been at the core of Paacuteuricrsquos development and they have done an awful lot for us.

Most of the land is currently vacant.A pedestrian footbridge over the Cardf Bay Link road would connect to the proposed new arena development, which is likely to get planning permission on Wednesday, March .Cllr Russell Goodway, cabinet member for investment and development, said: “One of the ways in which we will ensure that a signicant amount of the pedestrians leaving the arena on an event day doesn’t go past residential properties iswe can get that additional station on Pierhead Street.“Because then people would be able to walk out of the arena, across the public square, and then over a new bridge which will take them to that station and then off to the east of Cardf.”He was addressing the council’s cabinet on Thursday, March , about the wider regeneration plans across Cardf Bay. These include turning Lloyd George Avenue into a linear park and upgrading the cycling lanes there, building a velodrome at the International Sports Village, building a new lido near Techniquest, and hosting events at Alexandra Head.As well as building a ,-capacity arena, the wider redevelopment of Atlantic Wharf would also see the Travelodge hotel and Red Dragon Centre relocated, new museums, a multi-storey car park, hotels, apartments, a new tourist attraction, and a public square. Most of this would be built where the Red Dragon Centre, County Hall and car parks currently are.But some concerns already raised by local residents include the noise of bands playing at the arena, and thousands of people leaving after a concert late at night. Having a new metro station at Pierhead Street could ert those people away from houses and flats nearby..removeTransport for Wales is due to start working on the railway along Lloyd George Avenue this August, electrying the track. The current route to Cardf Bay only stops at Queen Street station, and not Central station, but could soon be upgraded to stop there too. Another new station could also be built at Loudon Square.A recent cabinet report said: “The initial phase of the Cardf Bayproject is due to start on site in August , and the plans to link the new line into Cardf Central and onto a new station at Roath Basin are moving rapidly through the design phases.“The council is working with the Welsh Government to extend the current investment in the Core Valley Lines extension, to provide a direct link to Cardf Central station and to extend the line further into Cardf Bay, connecting to a proposed new transport hub at Pierhead Street, and onto a new station at Roath Basin.“This would essentially form the first phase of the council’s Crossrail project. Positive discussions have taken place and remain ongoing with the owner of the Pierhead Street site, which has been identied as the preferred location for the new Cardf Bay transport hub.“Later phases of the council’s Crossrail project will see new stations delivered at Splott, Tremorfa, Newport Road and then onto the proposed new Cardf Parkway mainline station, providing the first public transport rail infrastructure for the east of Cardf.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDefeats by West Ham, Arsenal and Crystal Palace in the last couple of weeks took the sheen off Wolves reaching the -point barrier in the Premier League but they ed to form on Thursday against the troubled Hornets.Strikes from Raul Jimenez and Daniel Podence sandwiched a Cucho Hernandez own goal as Wolves went three up inside  minutes before Neves’ deft chip late on saw the club equal their biggest win in the Premier League.Wolves head coach Bruno Lage was particularly critical of his players in the wake of their first-half display against Palace last weekend so Neves was relieved they bounced back and called on them to maintain their levels.“It was perfect for us,” he told the club website. “Coming from three defeats in a row is hard, but we prepared ourselves really well for this game and I think we totally deserved the three points.“We played like we want to play every time, it was really good for us and for our fans. That’s what we want to do every single game.“The  minutes against Palace was not good enough and our fans didn’t deserve that, like the gaffer said.“That’s how we want to play every single game, and we worked really well, and we’ll try to do that every match until the end, because that’s the way we like to play for our fans.”With  matches of the campaign remaining, Wolves remain eighth and on the cusp of the European places heading into Sunday’s trip to Everton, where they will again be without injured full-backs Ki-Jana Hoever and Nelson Semedo.Yet Neves insisted they are paying no attention to their place in the standings, merely taking one fixture at a time.“I know we are always saying the same thing, but it’s the truth, we go game by game,” he said. “We don’t look at the table, we look to ourselves, to the way we play, and the things we need to improve..remove“That’s our way to work, since I came here, and it’s been successful for us, thinking about the next match.”Neves courted the headlines for his th-minute finish against Watford, controlling the ball on the edge of the box before expertly lofting an inch-perfect finish over goalkeeper Ben Foster.“It was a good goal,” he added. “I practise it a lot in training to be honest. The goalkeepers don’t like it, it’s something that’s really hard for them, because the ball goes to the second post and they are never expecting that.”Lage has been particularly struck by his fellow Portuguese, adding: “This is the first time I’ve worked with Ruben and it’s a big pleasure. He wants to improve. He’s an amazing guy, a top player and deserves all the best.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ruben Neves discovers  uperfect u blueprint for success as Wolves thrash Watford article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDiplomats offered no timetable for when the months-long talks in Vienna would resume. Negotiators even on Friday maintained that a road map was near for how the United States could rejoin the accord it unilaterally withdrew from in , and for Iran to again limit its rapidly advancing nuclear program.While Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, only referred to “external factors” forcing the pausing, it appeared the Russian demand caused the disruption.“The real issue for this pause here is what Russia has thrown on the table, which is essentially a grenade in the middle of the negotiations,” said Henry Rome, deputy head of research at the Eurasia Group who has been following the talks.Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he wanted “guarantees at least at the level of the secretary of state” that the US sanctions would not affect Moscow’s relationship with Tehran.A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors.A final text is essentially ready and on the table.As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement.— Josep Borrell FontellesMarch , While American officials sought to describe the demand as not related to the Vienna talks, matters swtly stalled on Friday with a tweet from Mr Borrell.“A pause in #ViennaTalks is needed, due to external factors. A final text is essentially ready and on the table,” Mr Borrell wrote. “As coordinator, I will, with my team, continue to be in touch with all #JCPOA participants and the U.S. to overcome the current situation and to close the agreement.”.removeThe JCPOA, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is the formal name of the  deal that saw Iran limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lting of economic sanctions.EU negotiator Enrique Mora met on Friday with Iranian officials before telling journalists that “we are almost there” with the talks.“Almost everything is done,” Mr Mora said. “We are almost at the limit of negotiating footnotes.”Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said the pause “could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue” ahead of restoring the deal.“Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all,” he wrote on Twitter. “No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement.”Mr Khatibzadeh did not identy the “external” issue — Iran has been careful in the waning days of the talks not to upset Russia, which it views as an ally against the US.Pause in #ViennaTalks could be a momentum for resolving any remaining issue and a final .Successful conclusion of talks will be the main focus of all.No external factor will affect our joint will to go forward for a collective agreement. https:t.co pAblzGjhd— Saeed Khatibzadeh | سعید خطیب‌زادهMarch , A report by Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, quoting an anonymous source it described as close to Tehran’s negotiators, also suggested Russia’s demands caused the pause.“There are some issues such as the issues between Russia and the United States, which, of course, will be unrelated to the issue of Iran’s talks … and that need to be resolved between the US and Russia,” IRNA quoted the source as saying.However, Russian Ambassador Mikhail Ulyanov, speaking to journalists outside of the Vienna hotel where the talks took place, insisted: “I’m not aware of any impasse.”“Contacts will continue,” he said. “The conclusion of the deal does not depend on Russia only.”Chinese Ambassador Wang Qun said negotiators “regret the pause” and added, “as we know, negotiation cannot be conducted in a political vacuum.”German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it was key for the negotiation that there are “no attempts from outside to undo the success of these talks.”“For me it is very clear that it is also the job of powers such as Russia or China that they support these results constructively,” Mr Scholz said. vw,vw,px, px\"European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell On Thursday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price had said America was “close to a possible deal — it’s really down to a very small number of outstanding issues”.But he also warned America had “no intention of offering Russia anything new or specic as it relates to the sanctions”.However, British negotiator Stephanie Al-Qaq struck a more sombre note, warning on Friday on Twitter that the “external factors must be resolved in next few days or agreement likely to unravel”.The  nuclear deal saw Iran put advanced centruges into storage under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency , while keeping its enrichment at .% purity and its stockpile at only kg of uranium. It also halted enrichment at its underground Fordo nuclear facility.As of February , the IAEA says Iran’s stockpile of all enriched uranium was nearly ,kg. Some has been enriched up to % purity — a short technical step from weapons-grade levels of %. Meanwhile, Iran has stopped the IAEA from accessing its surveillance camera footage and has resumed enrichment at Fordo.That has worried nuclear non-proleration experts.
