Well, look at him now. He’s not even on a ventilator and he’s not suffering,’ he told reporters.The judge refused their application and given doctors the go-ahead to stop treatment and bring Alfie’s life to an end (Picture: Mercury) Barrister Paul Diamond, who represents the couple, told the judge that Alfie had been granted Italian citizenship on Monday (Picture: Mercury)Mr Evans said that he had a ‘lengthy talk’ with doctors and pleaded with them to give his son oxygen.‘They left him for six hours without food, water and oxygen,’ he said.‘I felt blessed when they confirmed they were going to give him his water and his oxygen.‘He’s now on oxygen. It’s not changing his breathing but it’s oxygenating his body.’"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kate-oates.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"corrie boss kate oates steps replaced emmerdales iain macleod","story":"(Picture: )Coronation Street’s boss Kate Oates has confirmed her intention to step down from her role, after propelling the soap back to the top of its game and increasing it’s viewing figures and audience engagement. Kate has had a much talked about reign on the show during the last two years but took the decision to move on to prime time drama, adding to  that it had always been her intention to do a couple of years.Speaking to us last month, she said: ‘I have loved my time at Coronation Street and will be forever grateful for my time here but I am only ever keeping the seat warm, as is every producer. I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved – from tackling some seriously important storylines to opening up a brand new set and making a smooth transition to six episodes.’Kate’s tenure has certainly got fans talking – with debates raging on whether the show is too dark. But the show has, in recent months, increased the gap between itself and the other soaps in the ratings war and recently achieved a six year high. It was cleared in numerous Ofcom investigations following storyline complaints and has won a number of awards.Storylines have included the grooming ordeal of Bethany Platt, Pat Phelan’s several murders and the high profile exits of Aidan Connor and Eva Price.(Picture: ITV)Kate will be moving on to produce prime time dramas for the channel, starting with the next series of Bancroft. She told us: ‘I am incredibly excited to get started.’In a statement, she added: ‘Being a part of Coronation Street has quite simply been one of the best experiences of my life. I am proud of the stories we have told and the impact they have had – and I’ve had a ball working with one of the best and most talented teams in television. I’ll be forever grateful for this opportunity and all it has given me but I’m also excited to try something new. I can’t wait to make a start on Bancroft, working with the brilliant Sarah Parish and Tall Story Pictures – and I’ll continue to love watching both ITV soaps from the comfort of my sofa.’She will be replaced on Coronation Street by Iain MacLeod, who will transfer over from his role as Emmerdale’s boss. Iain will be replaced at the Dales by ITV Drama Commissioner Jane Hudson who is responsible for the future editorial and creative direction of the soap.Assistant Producer Kate Brooks becomes Producer alongside current Series Script Producer Laura Shaw who also becomes a Producer. Kate and Laura will produce blocks of episodes on a rotational basis and take responsibility for the day to day running of the programme. The Emmerdale appointments will take effect from the beginning of June, to coincide with Iain taking the helm at Coronation Street.Iain said: ‘Working on Emmerdale at a time when it’s enjoyed such success has been a total joy and I will miss the people and the place immensely – it’s a special show full of huge talent.‘Only Corrie could have tempted me away. It gave me my first job in TV as an assistant researcher many years ago and to be returning as producer is the fulfilment of a longstanding dream. It’ll be like a reunion with an old friend and I look forward to continuing the amazing work already being done by everyone connected with the show.’MORE: Coronation Street spoilers: What happens next?

TravelButterfly.Tuesday 24 Apr 2018 8:00 amSafaris are often described as a ‘trip of a lifetime’ so it’s not surprising they have a bit of a reputation for costing a fortune.Accommodation doesn’t come cheap, with most lodges and tented camps (basically glamping) only offering all-inclusive packages.Having dreamed of travelling through South Africa, Namibia and Botswana since I was a child, I was determined there had to be another way to do it.With some research and time to plan, my partner and I made it work.Here are five tips on how to safari in southern Africa on a budget.It may seem like a daunting task but don’t be tempted to book your safari through an agency. They will take a cut of the fare.Instead, research the areas you want to visit (TripAdvisor, blogs and the 4×4 South Africa forum are a good place to start).Most national parks, conservancies and game reserves now have online booking systems and email contact.A home on wheels – complete with rooftop tent, camping equipment and bedding (Picture: Karen Edwards, TravelButterfly)Most three-star lodges cost between £160 and £500 per night depending on location. Safaris and other meals are charged on top of this.Campsites around South Africa, Namibia and Botswana, on the other hand, charge around £10 per person, per night – £50 is the absolute maximum.It is an incredibly rewarding experience, offering you the kind of freedom organised tours do not.Most hire companies offer 4WDs complete with rooftop tent, bedding, camping equipment and a fridge. You only need to buy the food, water and wood for fires. The 4WD doubles up as your safari vehicle, too.Bushtrackers in Johannesburg hire out a single cab Toyota Hilux 4WD, with rooftop tent and camping accessories, from about £77 per day.The most straightforward itinerary is a round trip from Johannesburg, spending four or five days at Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Etosha National Park, Namibia and the Central Kalahari in Botswana.Setting up camp on the Botswanan side of Kgalagadi (Picture: Karen Edwards, TravelButterfly)Pack warm clothing. Temperatures can drop down to -10C at night during winter, but reach 25C during the day.There are no supermarkets inside the parks, so stock up on long-life food, water and booze when passing through big towns: rice, tinned vegetables and baked beans are ideal.We picked up fresh produce in smaller towns nearer the parks. Some camps have shops selling limited supplies like fresh steaks, sausages, bread and milk.Outdoor Warehouse in Johannesburg is great for camping supplies, including hard-wearing water canisters.We bought four which carried five litres each. These can be filled up with bottled water from supermarkets.Fill up with fuel at every opportunity as small towns near the parks run out due to demand.Always carry at least two spare 15-litre canisters.Lions, leopards and cheetahs tend to sleep during the day and hunt at night.The best time to see them is in the early morning (most parks allow you to drive from first light) and late afternoon, so it’s best to set up camp before dark.Most animals tend to hang out around waterholes in the early morning and when the daytime heat has subsided.Buy a guide book on wildlife footprints and droppings (yes, really) – we found many lions by tracking prints and elephants by their dung.Most importantly, when you do find an animal, give them space.Don’t crowd, chase or block their path. Observe them from a safe 30m distance.Finally, be patient. Wild animals have a tendency to show up unexpectedly rather than when you want them to.Some camps are completely isolated. Wildlife-wise, this is incredible, but this is also why it is important to pre-plan your route and stick to it.Give your itinerary to someone at home, so they know where you are each night.Most parks also check you in on arrival. Remember, in most places, you won’t even have phone reception.The heart of Provence: Where to stay during this year\u0027s Tour de FranceOnce it’s saved, this app can be used as an offline map.Print out Google Map routes, along with predicted timings, as back-up.Don’t drive in the dark. Not only could hit an animal, but if you break down or have a flat tyre, you won’t be aware of your surroundings.MORE: A vast, snowy wilderness: why you should visit SvalbardMORE: A unique safari: kissing giraffes at breakfast, a hidden lodge surrounded by rhino and sleeping under the stars in KenyaMORE: Shameful cruelty of animals sponsored by people who holiday in Thailand"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_8845983.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"people cracking typo pack sausages","story":"‘Sausage’ is regularly used in reference to someone’s schlong, they’re phallic and there are endless jokes to be made about someone shoving a sausage in their mouth.Sausages need no further wit to be funny.

It sprouted at a World War I site in France, the Battle of Belleau Wood, that became part of U.S. Marine Corps lore.After Trump\u0027s helicopter landed at Mount Vernon, the two presidents, each holding his wife\u0027s hand, walked a short distance and posed for pictures before they boarded golf carts that ferried them to the front door of Washington\u0027s plantation house. The couples were led on a brief outdoor tour before they entered the pale yellow building for dinner of Dover sole, pasta stuffed with lemon ricotta, and chocolate souffle and cherry vanilla ice cream.Trump declared the dinner \u0027really fantastic\u0027 before returning to the White House.

He was Macron\u0027s guest last July at the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris. Macron and his wife also took Trump and America\u0027s first lady on a tour of Napoleon\u0027s tomb and whisked them up in the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light.Macron will be welcomed back to the White House on Tuesday with a traditional arrival ceremony featuring nearly 500 members of the U.S. military and a booming 21-gun salute. The state visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office sit-down with Trump and a joint White House news conference. There\u0027s also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence.The French president\u0027s White House day will be capped Tuesday night with a state dinner, the highest social tribute a president bestows on an ally and partner.Melania Trump played an active role in every detail of the visit, said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  The State Dining Room at the White House set for the first State Dinner that President Donald Trump will host as president with French President Emmanuel Macron in WashingtonThe first lady settled on a state dinner menu of rack of lamb and nectarine tart, along with after-dinner entertainment provided by the Washington National Opera for about 150 guests. On Monday, she released details of the glitzy affair being planned to dazzle Macron and his wife, Brigitte.Dinner will be served in the State Dining Room, which will feature more than 2,500 stems of white sweet pea flowers and nearly 1,000 stems of white lilac. Separately, more than 1,200 branches of cherry blossoms will adorn the majestic Cross Hall.The first lady opted for a cream-and-gold color scheme, and will use a mix of china services from the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.State dinner tickets are highly sought after by Washington\u0027s political and business elite. A few of those expected to attend: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund and a former top French government official House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Mike Pompeo, Trump\u0027s choice to be the next secretary of state.In a break with tradition, Trump has invited no congressional Democrats or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements publicly. But some Democrats did make the cut, including Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, whose office confirmed his attendance"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/19/4B77B35800000578-0-image-m-181_1524507867432.jpg","title":"Republicans decry royal birth saying child born equal","story":"    The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to her new son at 11.01am after going into labour around 6amThat\u0027s my boy!

Around 4 p.m., after Madonna had given her small household staff the rest of the day off, he scaled the fence encircling the estate, broke into the house and confronted a terrified Madonna. \u0027After slapping her around, he bound and gagged her, then strapped her to a chair with twine. He berated and beat her for two hours, then stormed out of the house.\u0027 Maddona was eventually able to convince Penn to untie her according to the report, which stated: \u0027Once free, she dashed out of the house, jumped into the coral-colored 1957 Thunderbird Penn had bought her for her 28th birthday, locked the doors and called the police on her car phone. She then sped off to the Malibu sheriff\u0027s station to swear out a complaint against her husband.\u0027  Troubled times: Penn was briefly accused of assaulting then-wife Madonna in 1989, but the actress later denied he ever hit or abused her (couple on left in 1988) Allen was accused of molesting his adopted daughter Dylan (pair above in 1989) when she was a child, an allegation he deniesA week after filing that police report, Madonna changed her tune, however, and said the abuse never occurred reported the Times. She asked the district attorney to withdraw the charges, and a few hours later  filed for orce.The exes are now close friends, and Madonna even submitted a filing in support of Penn when he sued director Lee Daniels for $10 million back in 2015.That lawsuit was filed after Daniels was asked to comment on domestic abuse allegations that were being made against the star of his show Empire in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.\u0027He ain\u0027t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn,\u0027 responded Daniels.Madonna did her best to aid Penn\u0027s complaint by submitting a court filing in which she stated:  \u0027I am also aware of allegations concerning an incident that occurred in December, 1989, which purportedly resulted in Sean’s arrest for domestic assault and battery against me. I know those allegations to be false. \u0027While we certainly had more than one heated argument during our marriage, Sean has never struck me, tied me up, or physically assaulted me, and any report to the contrary is completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false.\u0027Penn and Daniels eventually settled that lawsuit with the director apologizing and making a charitable donation.  \u0027Empire\u0027s\u0027 \u0026quotBatshit Crazy\u0026quot Behind-the-Scenes Drama: On the Set of TV¿s Hottest Show | Hollywood ReporterEntertainment \u0026amp the Arts | A Marriage Filled With Abuse | Seattle Times NewspaperCharlie Rose spotted dining out with Sean Penn | Page SixDylan Farrow Describes Woody Allen¿s Alleged Sexual Abuse in Open Letter | Vanity Fair"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/20/4B77FA5600000578-0-image-m-71_1524511282557.jpg","title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE Queen denies Tony Blair royal honour AGAIN","story":"     Once again Blair is conspicuous by his absence and remains plain Mr Blair 11 years after leaving officeAnother royal snub for Tony Blair — the Queen announced two new additions to the Knights of the Garter yesterday, the oldest, most senior order of chivalry in the land.Former PMs have always been included, but once again Blair is conspicuous by his absence and remains plain Mr Blair 11 years after leaving office rather than ‘Sir Tony’. The numbers are restricted to 24 and, unlike most honours, the Order of the Garter is in the gift of the Queen without any advice from the Prime Minister. Members of the Order have an allocated seat at the Royal Chapel of St George’s, Windsor,There is some speculation that Blair’s role in the Iraq War may have blighted his chances. Tipping Point fans react with fury after royal baby coverage...Share this articleOr perhaps he does not wish to be a knight at all?

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/23/19/4B77B35800000578-0-image-m-181_1524507867432.jpg","title":"ARTHUR favourite newborn prince bookies paying Royal nod legendary king","story":"Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

As he was going down my right side, he squeezed my breast using his right hand.\u0027It lasted for a couple of seconds. He covered the whole of my breast with his hand. I would call this a grab or a grope.

I didn\u0027t say anything at the time as I was too shocked.\u0027He appeared to be acting normal, he wasn\u0027t nervous, or excited or aroused and the conversation carried on as normal. He was talking and I was listening.\u0027It wasn\u0027t a passing touch, it was a proper grope, I have no idea if he got sexual motivation from doing this. I know I didn\u0027t say anything to anyone.\u0027But a few days later I discovered my partner of 16 years had exposed himself to my granddaughter so I separated from him and I reported him to the police.\u0027  During evidence Zakoput\u0027s lawyer Liam Duffy told Patient A: \u0027If he did touch your breast, he is very sorry for any upset or distress it caused you.\u0027He was following procedure and if he did accidentally touch your breast, it was not sexually motivated.\u0027Zakout, who currently works as a consultant at Weston General Hospital in Bristol and is also a lecturer at the city\u0027s university, denies sexually motivated misconduct.The hearing continues.

It sprouted at a World War I site in France, the Battle of Belleau Wood, that became part of U.S. Marine Corps lore.After Trump\u0027s helicopter landed at Mount Vernon, the two presidents, each holding his wife\u0027s hand, walked a short distance and posed for pictures before they boarded golf carts that ferried them to the front door of Washington\u0027s plantation house. The couples were led on a brief outdoor tour before they entered the pale yellow building for dinner of Dover sole, pasta stuffed with lemon ricotta, and chocolate souffle and cherry vanilla ice cream.Trump declared the dinner \u0027really fantastic\u0027 before returning to the White House.

He was Macron\u0027s guest last July at the annual Bastille Day military parade in the center of Paris. Macron and his wife also took Trump and America\u0027s first lady on a tour of Napoleon\u0027s tomb and whisked them up in the Eiffel Tower for dinner overlooking the City of Light.Macron will be welcomed back to the White House on Tuesday with a traditional arrival ceremony featuring nearly 500 members of the U.S. military and a booming 21-gun salute. The state visit also offers Macron his first Oval Office sit-down with Trump and a joint White House news conference. There\u0027s also a State Department lunch hosted by Vice President Mike Pence.The French president\u0027s White House day will be capped Tuesday night with a state dinner, the highest social tribute a president bestows on an ally and partner.Melania Trump played an active role in every detail of the visit, said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  The State Dining Room at the White House set for the first State Dinner that President Donald Trump will host as president with French President Emmanuel Macron in WashingtonThe first lady settled on a state dinner menu of rack of lamb and nectarine tart, along with after-dinner entertainment provided by the Washington National Opera for about 150 guests. On Monday, she released details of the glitzy affair being planned to dazzle Macron and his wife, Brigitte.Dinner will be served in the State Dining Room, which will feature more than 2,500 stems of white sweet pea flowers and nearly 1,000 stems of white lilac. Separately, more than 1,200 branches of cherry blossoms will adorn the majestic Cross Hall.The first lady opted for a cream-and-gold color scheme, and will use a mix of china services from the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.State dinner tickets are highly sought after by Washington\u0027s political and business elite. A few of those expected to attend: Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund and a former top French government official House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Mike Pompeo, Trump\u0027s choice to be the next secretary of state.In a break with tradition, Trump has invited no congressional Democrats or journalists, said a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the arrangements publicly.

Prince George talks to his great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth ahead of the Christening of his sister Princess Charlotte  Prince Charles with Prince William and Harry pictured inside Kensington Palace (left) and the family with Princess Diana (right)          The grounds of Kensington Palace where the new prince has been taken this evening following his arrival today           An official pictured released for Prince George\u0027s birthday           Prince George, wearing a white dressing gown, greets Barack and Michelle Obama          Prince George plays with the Cambridge\u0027s family dog Lupo in the grounds of Kensington Palace‘It’s the home of a modern couple, lots of photographs of the children and the bits of artwork they bring home from school,’ says a friend.‘It’s a welcoming home, but William does guard their privacy and he limits the number of outsiders who are let in to the family circle.’ Evenings are often spent in front of the television with a take-away curry from Malabar in Notting Hill — collected by one of the orderlies, not delivered.          George and Charlotte wait in the window of Kensington PalaceWilliam has succeeded in creating something of the warm family atmosphere he found with the Middletons when he first knew Kate. But, as working royals, he long ago accepted that his and Kate’s home could never be quite like theirs. He’s matched them in one area, however — like them, he now has three children.By last night everything had been made ready in the Peter Rabbit-themed nursery to welcome home George and Charlotte’s new baby brother. I gather there are some new additions to the nursery, but no fresh licks of paint.There are, however, lots of new soft toys already — some from George and Charlotte — and many baby presents have also been delivered to the Palace.Officially, the couple say they won’t be hiring a maternity nurse to help with the early days of the new arrival. Insiders say Kate plans to breastfeed her new baby, but no one would think less of her if she did decide to call in specialist help, particularly during the night (a maternity nurse will normally sleep with the newborn and take the baby to its mother to be fed).After the birth of Prince George in 2013, Kate was on her knees with exhaustion because he hardly slept, and wanted his mother’s constant attention.When George was born, William and Kate had the builders in at Kensington Palace and were still living in cosy two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage.They almost immediately headed off to the Berkshire home of the Duchess’s parents.          The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pose for photographs in the garden of Kensington Palace with their son George and dogsBy the time Charlotte arrived two years later, the £4.5 million refurbishment of Apartment 1A had been completed. With five reception rooms, three master bedrooms with adjoining dressing rooms and bathrooms, there is certainly plenty of space.The imaginative transformation includes a night nursery where Charlotte and George sleep, and a day nursery for playtime.On the first floor are the master bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and his-and-hers dressing rooms.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle appeared in the grounds of Kensington Palace, where they live in Nottingham Cottage, after they announced their engagement.On the top floor, reached by a lift, are nine further bedrooms for staff, while a basement area where the photographer Earl of Snowdon once had his darkroom is now a well-appointed gym with laundry and luggage rooms nearby.The kitchen, on which the couple spent £170,000 of their own money, is the heart of this royal home, and where they like to entertain close friends and family.For more formal occasions guests, who arrive through a bright and airy entrance hall with intricate cornicing and black and white flagstones, are shown to one of the two drawing rooms — in one there is a grand piano and cream sofas with floral scatter cushions.Soon enough, the latest addition to the House of Windsor will no doubt be crawling all over them with mischief in mind."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/24/08/4B7BB3A500000578-5650181-Diners_watched_a_Teppanyaki_chef_douse_the_pan_in_oil_and_dramat-a-74_1524553216646.jpg","title":"Dramatic moment Japanese chefs try impress set sprinklers drench diners","story":"    Hungry diners watched in anticipation as a chef prepared their meal at a popular Teppanyaki restaurant          Diners watched a Teppanyaki chef douse the pan in oil and dramatically set the grill alight as he stepped back to admire his impressive stuntBut in an unexpected twist the ceiling starts to pour with water, drenching the horrified customers seated below.As the diners duck for cover, the hotshot chef realises the restaurant\u0027s sprinkler system has soaked the food and makes a quick exit from the scene. History in the baking!

Was Queen Victoria a thief? Alice Procter take us on one of her Uncomfortable Art Tours, which aim to show how the empire still exerts a grip on British galleriesLast June, Alice Procter started running free gallery tours. She had answered a call-out from Antiuniversity, a project that helps organise radical educational events, and wanted to try out an idea. Her plan was to take people through museums, looking at the ways colonialism continues to influence their displays and the aesthetics of art, and examine the role of empire in funding the spaces themselves. She didn’t think they’d be popular – but they sold out.The MA student now does Uncomfortable Art tours at the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the British Museum, the V\u0026ampA, the National Maritime Museum and Tate Britain. “My parents took me to museums when I was a kid,” says the 23-year-old, “so I’ve always been very comfortable in art galleries. I have experience as a tour guide, I fit the profile of the typical young white girl who’s an art history student doing a guided tour. And I can use that.”Why the empire? “I have always been interested in the art of the British empire. I’m Australian and I grew up understanding there is a multiplicity to historical narratives. So I was aware that history is always just storytelling. I feel fairly confident in spaces like this, and coming in and telling stories in them, because I know that’s just what the building is. A building.”The group who have turned up for today’s sold-out tour at Tate Britain are mostly white, mostly female and mostly young, something Procter says is typical. She also gets “arts students, people who work in education, and museum people who want to know how to do this sort of thing in their own institutions. Which is nice.”It quickly becomes clear why Procter’s tours have done so well. Rarely using notes, she clearly knows what she’s talking about, mixing the historical context with present-day reflections on everything from corporate sponsorship to the Legacies of British Slave-ownership project at University College London. She also interrogates how the Tate displays the work, as well as the labels with information she suggests is glossed over or even unmentioned. The tour, starting at 11am and lasting only an hour, is a quickfire look at select paintings and sketches from the 17th and 18th centuries. We begin with Elizabeth I, when “ideas of Britishness began to be defined”, and continue until the abolition of the British slave trade in 1833. It’s fascinating. We see William Hogarth’s sketches for A Rake’s Progress that, Procter explains, are filled with elements an 18th-century audience would have recognised as caricaturing and demonising everything deemed foreign. Later, she uses a William Beechey painting to point out the similarities between Sir Francis Ford’s anti-abolitionist arguments and the sentiment you sometimes hear today that British charity should begin at home with “the white working class” as opposed to abroad. She doesn’t shy away from politics, mentioning issues such as Brexit and handing attendees free badges saying: “Display it like you stole it.” Her website is equally blunt, containing portraits of fine-looking gents with words such as “murderer” or “illegal immigrant” scrawled over them in red.This tour is relatively quiet. Procter says attendees “tend to be a lot more conversational” – but it’s clear the people agree with her. They are vocal, too, nodding and murmuring words such as “awful” whenever she mentions slavery. At times, it’s a little like an echo chamber.“You kind of know what you’re signing up for,” she says, “so I tend to get people who broadly agree with me.” Is this a good thing? She sighs. “I think it’s a thing. There are better places to have arguments over whether the British empire was good or bad than in an art gallery. The point of these tours is that they’re educational. So yes, people who come broadly agree with me, but they’re coming because they want to know more.”Shamma, who is studying at the Royal College of Art and is originally from Dubai, says: “I did like the tour. I wanted to hear more, but there’s a lot of information and not much time.” Shamma admits to feeling “a little uncomfortable” as the tour went on. “I look at the techniques, and I’ve been so ignorant about how disgusting some of these works are. Suddenly I felt ashamed, like, ‘Oh, I don’t want to look at this any more.’ But I think it’s necessary.”Procter has high hopes for the future. “At the moment, the tours are run from my kitchen. It’s just me, but they’re growing. I want to start working with other people, help people develop their own tours of different sites, get out of London, work with school groups. There’s so much I want to do, but I’m studying and suddenly this is a full-time job.“My hope was that people could come and it would be a bit of a wake-up call. Then they would go and find more information.” However, those aims have changed. She hopes extra knowledge will encourage people to be more vocal, so that galleries will change everything from how they display work to what they put on the label. “That’s my bigger aim.”• Find out more about future Uncomfortable Art Tours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939e6ed4fc3539254f37a2ee76b0958e76646ca9/0_0_2890_4342/master/2890.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d49fa47dda63f111fcb23f8e8f84a5cd 480w","title":"london nights exploring capital after dark in pictures","story":"Fusing portraiture, documentary, conceptual photography and film, London Nights will reveal the capital after dark through photographs from the late-19th century to the present day.

That milestone in turn was smashed on Monday afternoon and the UK passed the 72-hour mark at 10am on Tuesday. The coal-free run is expected to continue until later in the day, though some analysts said it was likely to end when demand peaks on Tuesday evening.Without the fossil fuel, nearly a third of Britain’s electricity was supplied by gas, followed by windfarms and nuclear on around a quarter each.The rest came from biomass burned at Drax power station in North Yorkshire, imports from France and the Netherlands, and solar power. Drax said it expected to go without coal on Tuesday.The coal-free records are a reversal from the recent highs that coal plant owners experienced during the so-called “beast from the east” cold snap. During cold weather in February and early March, demand for gas to use in heating pushed up the price of gas for power, which brought coal power stations online.However, overall power demand is now much lower following the recent warm weather, making it easier for gas, renewables and nuclear to cover much of the UK’s needs. National Grid has forecast electricity demand this summer will be lower than last year, with minimum demand at 17GW and peak at 33.7GW. Demand on Tuesday is expected to peak at about 35GW. Experts said to expect more milestones this year. “Ever rising renewable capacity in the UK will see these records fall more and more frequently, clearly showing progress made over the past decade or two,” said Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.However, one observer cautioned that the shift away from coal could be a “false dawn” if it was just replaced by gas. Andrew Crossland, who tracks electricity generation on the MyGridGB site, said: “Shifting to gas is likely to make our electricity market more volatile as our energy price becomes increasingly locked to international gas markets. That will only hurt consumers.”A carbon tax, the cheaper price of gas and the rise of renewables have all hit coal operators. The government has set a deadline of October 2025 for phasing out coal entirely.Two coal plant owners have said they will shut this year, which will leave the UK with six coal power stations including Drax, which has hinted it will close before the 2025 target."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62007b426f2fd3341d5221d661f534a208d16e42/0_152_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c28271744ef40e5693d8c5d79f24ef2","title":"vodafone named uks worst mobile phone provider by which","story":"Mobile operator hits bottom in consumer group’s annual survey for seventh consecutive yearVodafone has been named as the UK’s worst mobile phone provider by the consumer group Which?It is the seventh year running that Vodafone has come bottom of the consumer group’s annual survey of how happy the UK public is with their mobile operator.

She starts her day at 7am and often works until 9pm, seven days a week. For her efforts, she receives about HK$41 (£3.60) per day.Wong is one of an estimated thousand senior citizens nicknamed “cardboard grannies” who collect and sell waste boxes and other scrap across nine of the poorest districts in the city.When the company Wong distributed promotional leaflets for closed down, she found herself unable to find other employment. With no savings, family support, sufficient pension or social security income, selling cardboard has become her only means of scraping by. “I ended up homeless because I didn’t have enough money to pay the rent,” says Wong. “Even a sub-ided flat costs around HK$4,000 per month and I didn’t have the money for that.”Cardboard grannies are one of the most visible indicators of Hong Kong’s struggle to support its rapidly ageing population. According to researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, the city now has the longest life expectancy in the world. On average, men in Hong Kong live for 81.3 years and women for 87.3 years – beating other “blue zones” (regions with the oldest and healthiest people in the world) such as Japan and Italy.However, any sense of pride in the world’s longest life expectancy is overshadowed by the fact that one third of Hong Kong’s elderly live in poverty. Official figures from 2016 put the figure at 478,400 people aged 65 or over languishing below the poverty line, which is set at a monthly income of HK$3,800 (£345).For one of the richest cities in the world, with a GDP per capita higher than the UK, Germany and Japan, poverty has become an embarrassment. Public funds for the elderly are considered a pittance. The government’s Old Age Living Allowance is currently the most popular cash assistance, which offers a monthly payment of up to HK$2,600. Such handouts are often dubbed “fruit money” as they are too meagre to pay for anything else. In addition, most of the subsidies are means tested, which many locals find degrading and a significant barrier to seeking help.“We are fortunate as a city to have money and budget surplus. We have to think out of the box because the issues around low fertility rates and longest life expectancy have arisen so fast,” says Prof Paul Yip, chair of population health at the University of Hong Kong. “I don’t think the government has put aside much time to deal with it – we have to face the problems and respond to them in a timely manner and while we have the money.”In the Kwai Chung area, 67-year-old Miss Lan Tsz also collects cardboard to sell to recyclers, often working from 6.30am to 11pm at night, despite suffering from arthritis in her legs. She says her only immediate hope is avoiding government workers, who regularly confiscate her cardboard and belongings.“The environmental and food hygiene department comes and confiscates my cardboard twice a week,” says Lan Tsz. “They even try to resell it themselves.”Under existing laws Lan Tsz and her peers may be prosecuted for obstructing public space or unlicensed hawking. In a much-publicised case last year, an elderly cardboard collector in Hong Kong was arrested by officers after she was caught selling a cardboard box without a license for HK$1 to a domestic helper. The arrest resulted in public outcry with the authorities eventually dropping the charges. The incident was widely condemned as evidence of the state’s failure to protect its older and most vulnerable people from poverty.“Although we understand the officers are exercising the law, the issue highlights a complete lack of respect for the work that these grannies do,” says Tang Wing-him, a ministry officer from the Hong Kong School of Poverty Caring.Tang says these incidents are not isolated. He recalls another recent example when the same government department confiscated a pushcart from one of the cardboard collectors for unlawfully occupying public space. The collector was then told that she would have to pay a HK$1,500 fine to get it back. Such incidents have left grassroots organisations determined to find workable solutions. “The government regards what the cardboard collectors do as picking up rubbish which they deem unlawful, consequently there is little to no protection in terms of health and safety for them,” says Tang. “They don’t view these grannies as official members of the recycling industry. I am actively working to get their work and contributions officially recognised so that they can receive proper wages, better protection and dignity.”Amid rising life expectancies, cities around the world are looking at how to tackle poverty among senior citizens through employment. One example is a 60+ employment centre in Jerusalem, which aims to provide assistance to those who depend on small pensions and have been forced to re-enter the labour force in order to supplement their income. By increasing awareness among employers about the advantages of workers aged over 60, the centre aims to prevent poverty, reduce ageism and better integrate the elderly in a productive and meaningful life.The desire to work and feel useful is a driving motivator for many of the cardboard collectors. “If I sit around and do nothing I will get ill,” says Lan Tsz. “As long as I remain healthy I will still pick up the cardboard.” This is coupled by a sense of pride in wanting to pay her own way. “I don’t want to live on social security – I prefer to try and be self sufficient. I have never taken any money from the government.”Tang and other community workers are calling upon Hong Kong’s government to officially recognise the cardboard grannies’ work in the recycling industry so that they can receive benefits, better protection and a working environment where they don’t have to live in fear of having their cardboard confiscated – or worse, arrest.“The government has to recognise the contribution that the elderly make in a rapidly ageing society,” says Tang. “My view is that the government has a responsibility to look after the retired population as a basic right. We don’t have a long-term vision to make Hong Kong a more age-friendly city. Structural changes in our society need to occur for there to be real change. Before we can have an age-friendly city, we first need an age-friendly government.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b20f020f1af1b006a7540749470080282e703e/0_138_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984dbe7f5683ad6bc2e5e86cc1f3574f","title":"abolish bank holidays jeremy corbyn annual leave","story":"Jeremy Corbyn used St George’s Day yesterday to reiterate Labour’s manifesto commitment to create four new bank holidays, corresponding to the four patron saint days across the UK. The Labour leader argues that Britain has fewer public holidays – just eight – than almost all other EU countries. On this he is right: Finland leads the way with 15, and the average is just over 12. But what looks like a worker-supporting vote-winner is actually wonky policy that will benefit few.Most of us will be forced to take four days of annual leave on random days in winter and early spring, frequently mid-week. Many will continue to be excluded from any celebratory time off with friends and family.Corbyn argues that after eight years of Tory austerity, workers deserve some extra days off he also says these days will be paid. Although on first appearance it’s a policy that seems to benefit all of us, the truth is few will benefit, many will be harmed, and it will be a complete irrelevance to those working in more precarious and poorly paid sectors of the economy. And that’s ignoring the practicality of the dates suggested. The new public holidays would be on 30 November, 1 March, 17 March and 23 April, all at inclement times of the year three are close to each other and close to both Easter (and the first May public holiday). To make matters worse, these dates will often occur mid-week – so no long-weekend getaway.It’s important to realise how public holidays fit into annual leave rights more generally. At present almost all workers and employees are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid time off a year. There is no statutory right to take time off on public holidays, or to be paid extra or get time off in lieu if you do work them. Many workers will have a contractual right to paid public holidays, but frequently this eats into their overall statutory right to annual leave, reducing the time they can choose to take off. Many employers, particularly smaller- to medium-sized ones in the private sector, comply with the right to time off by providing four weeks of paid holiday at times to be agreed, plus the eight statutory public holidays.If the number of public holidays were to be increased to 12, that would mean many employers would revise their contracts to allow workers to take only three weeks and one day off at the time of their choosing, to account for the extra days. Even those with more generous annual leave entitlements would probably find the new public holidays eating into their overall entitlement, as contracts of employment usually itemise public holidays, rather than providing a general entitlement to not work on public holidays, and employers would not be willing to fund an additional four days holiday pay every year.This policy also ignores those workers who do not have the right to take public holidays off, and for whom public holidays are associated with longer hours and more demanding work. For those working in lower-wage jobs in the service economy, in pubs, restaurants and shops for example, public holidays are not holidays at all, but times when they are forced to work additional hours. Similarly, for anyone working precariously in the so-called gig economy, for example for Uber or Deliveroo, or on a zero-hours contract used by many pubs and restaurants, saying no to public holiday work is not an option. The only way to make public holidays meaningful for lower-paid service workers would be to force all shops, cinemas, bars and so on to close for the day.If Labour wants to give people more days off it will have to be through increasing the amount of statutory leave we are entitled to, not some extra symbolic public holidays. Corbyn should look at increasing the current right to 5.6 weeks paid leave to say, six weeks, which would be the equivalent of four “extra” public holidays.But they would be paid, and could be taken at times to be chosen, and would benefit all workers. Importantly, Labour should look to measures to ensure that more workers are enabled to take up their existing rights to paid time off.Modern working practices, and especially the gig economy, are making it easier for businesses to give workers bogus self-employment status, thus denying them their right to paid annual leave (among other things). Challenging this is about enforcing existing rights, not increasing them, although to be fair to Corbyn he does propose serious crackdowns on these practices, including a Ministry of Labour to enforce workers’ rights, and punitive fines for employers found to be using bogus self-employment.Public holidays are an anachronism in today’s economy. In addition to enforcing existing paid holiday entitlements, it would be better if Corbyn proposed abolishing all public holidays bar Christmas Day. This would provide workers with 5.4 weeks of annual leave, but at times they could request.That really would increase workers’ rights, and perhaps surprisingly would also benefit the economy as businesses would continue trading, rather than feeling pressure to close down for seven fixed days during the year.• Anna Macey is a barrister practising in employment, discrimination and education law"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/732de0af45fad46299aef1aa10c8727bbdad269c/0_90_4471_2683/master/4471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad9bda6812930433082e29c235638dca","title":"uk universities erosion integrity bologna statement","story":"The Bologna statement, which defines the very purpose of universities, doesn’t seem to apply to the UK any moreIn 1988, to mark the 900th anniversary of the founding of the University of Bologna, Europe’s oldest university, 388 rectors and heads of universities drew up the Magna Charta Universitatum. This was a brief general declaration of the nature of universities and their purpose.The first principle was: “The university is an autonomous institution at the heart of societies differently organised because of geography and historical heritage”. The second fundamental principle was: “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university life, and governments and universities … must ensure respect for this fundamental requirement.”The Bologna statement was an affirmation of an ideal transcending national frontiers. Its principles were reaffirmed in a 1999 document establishing the European Higher Education Area, signed by the education ministers of 29 European countries, including the UK.Viewed from the everyday experience of a British university two decades later, these principles can ring hollow. “An autonomous institution”? Barely a month goes by without a new diktat issuing from Whitehall and its satellite agencies. Governance is as constrained as policy. One recognised expression of autonomy is for academic staff to have a say in who is appointed to the roles of deans, pro-vice-chancellors, and vice-chancellors. In British universities – unlike the majority of their European counterparts – that doesn’t happen.Another institutional expression of autonomy would be a senate that had effective control of academic and intellectual policy, but that body has been bypassed or abolished in nearly all UK universities.“Freedom in research”? Tell that to the colleague compelled by their research excellence framework manager to focus on a particular line of inquiry. Or tell it to the heads of department obliged to enforce the targets set by the pro-vice-chancellor (research) for the amount of money to be brought in by each member of staff through external grants. The mantras “accountability” and “performance management” mask the disturbing extent of institutional bullying in so many British universities.It has long been recognised in most university systems that academic freedom and academic tenure are two faces of the same coin, with appropriate legal protections to match. In Britain, however, tenure was abolished by the Tories’ Education Act of 1988. But academics still have de facto tenure, don’t they? Tell that to those who are made redundant as a result of the latest piece of managerialist restructuring.In Britain we are used to hearing a lot of sub-Burkean blather about how written constitutions are only needed by those countries that don’t have our practical wisdom and good judgment. But the truth is that genuine academic freedom in British universities is in a parlous condition. Not because uniformed commissars are frog-marching outspoken academics off to jail (not that there are that many outspoken academics in the first place). It is more a matter of the daily erosion of intellectual integrity, the relentless commodification of scholarly values, and the tightening grip of managerialist autocracy. And no one can seriously believe that any of this will be improved by leaving the EU and submitting to the unregulated embrace of global capitalism in its most buccaneering and profit-hungry form.Anyone tempted to dismiss these points as the alarmism of disappointed idealists or other malcontents should read the sober and detailed survey of academic freedom across Europe by Terence Karran and Lucy Mallinson. When measured against a range of standard criteria, including legal safeguards and de facto practices, the UK came bottom of the 28 member states of the EU. Similarly, the definitive text book The Law of Higher Education declares that “in terms of the health of academic freedom, the UK is clearly ‘the sick man of Europe’”.So they may soon have to rewrite the Magna Charta Universitatum. “The university is an autonomous institution (though not, in practice, in the UK …).” “Freedom in research and training is the fundamental principle of university life (though, funnily enough, not in the UK …).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2043b74a5f807ade490e21d6470727206edb5556/0_271_5841_3506/master/5841.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9964512e7bec40bed85ff93bdb8ca501","title":"hard brexit would mean more and cheaper british fish but theres a catch","story":"Exclusive: Taking back control of UK waters would lower the price of British-caught fish, new analysis shows – but most of the fish we eat is importedA hard Brexit that banned EU fishermen from UK waters would lead to many more fish being landed by British boats and a corresponding drop in prices, according to new economic analysis.But there’s a catch. Two-thirds of the fish UK consumers eat are imported from overseas, and the costs of those would rise, due to the trade barriers resulting from a hard Brexit. Moreover, the fall in the price of UK fish would lead to a drop in earnings for UK fishermen. Overall, the analysis shows closing the UK’s sea borders would be a “lose-lose situation” for both UK and EU consumers and fishing industries.The issue of fishing has become one of the most highly charged Brexit issues. The current EU system is perceived as unfair, with vessels from other EU nations landing 10 times more fish from UK waters than vice versa. Ministers have said UK boats will catch hundreds of thousands of tonnes more fish after Brexit. But fishermen have repeatedly expressed fears that the ministers will not “take back control” of UK waters, but instead will trade away access to British waters in exchange for access to other markets. In March, the UK government angered the industry by conceding that EU fishing rules will remain in place until 2020.Furthermore, the UK imports almost twice as much fish as it exports, with the top five being cod, tuna, prawns, salmon and haddock. The impact of a hard Brexit on trade would make these more expensive, the researchers found. The impact would also hit UK fish farms, which export most of their products, and the fish processing industry, which relies on imports.She said the apparent opportunity for the UK to “cash in” by closing marine borders is scotched by the analysis. “Overall, the advantage of an increased fish access is completely outweighed by the costs of protectionism,” the report concluded.Prof Bryce Beukers-Stewart, a fisheries expert at the University of York, UK, said: “What is interesting is they have taken a very broad view, unlike a lot of the other analyses.” This includes assessing impacts on both the UK and other EU nations, examining how changes in wild fisheries impact on farmed fish sales and how prices change.”It shows a familiar story – that the implications of Brexit are so much more complicated than the simple campaign message of ‘taking back control’ led people to believe,” Beukers-Stewart said, adding that he thinks a total ban on foreign vessels is unlikely as things stand.The increased fish caught in UK waters by UK boats in the hard Brexit scenario would be species such as blue whiting, herring and sand eels, Beukers-Stewart said: “There is not a huge appetite for these in the UK, to put it mildly.”But fisherman Aaron Brown, founder of the Fishing for Leave group, disagrees that the UK would lose out from a hard Brexit: “We regain approximately 600,000 tonnes net from a clean Brexit. Prices may drop short term but eventually they will recover as the UK processing industry also rebuilds.”“If the UK regains what should be rightfully her resources, implements new UK policy to address both EU and domestic failings, then the future can be very bright for British fishing,” he said.Helen McLachlan, at WWF-UK, said the new analysis held no surprises: “We import most of what we eat and export most of what we catch.” She said a good Brexit transition could see new rules enabling both a healthy ocean and a thriving fishing industry.The WUR analysis employed a widely used economic model and also tested to see how much changing the necessary assumptions affected their conclusions. The overall “lose-lose” outcome of a hard Brexit in fisheries remained in all circumstances, with only the scale of losses being different. “We have good trust in our results,” said Bartelings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86f60caf143f61648f8fc0041d34244cad2f093b/0_93_4586_2751/master/4586.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=162967aa5647dfb30f8220f209115257","title":"fashion revolution week seven ways to get involved","story":"Want to join the campaign to improve conditions in clothing factories? From showing support on social media to picking up a needle and thread, it is easy to helpFive years ago, the issue of where our clothes come from went from being a matter of curiosity to something more urgent. It was on 24 April 2013 that the Rana Plaza disaster occurred on the outskirts of Dhaka in Bangladesh more than 1,130 people died after the factory building in which they were working collapsed. The disaster galvanised Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro, co-founders of Fashion Revolution, into action. Fast-forward to now and it has grown into the world’s largest global fashion activism movement. Their campaign is simple. They are urging the industry to take more responsibility and show greater transparency in the supply chain. If brands do not know what is happening in the factories that supply them, if is difficult for them to improve conditions. Fashion Revolution asks one question: who made my clothes?There are many ways to support the campaign. By holding our favourite brands to account, it is possible to create change that minimises the risk of such a disaster recurring. Here are seven ways to get involved. Take a selfie showing the label from a piece of your clothing – or just take a picture of the label, if you are not a selfie fan – then post the image on social media with the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes in the caption. It is amazing how brands sit up and take notice. They might even be able to answer your question. Increasingly, companies are taking the issue of transparency seriously, but there is still a long way to go. “Too many people working in the fashion industry, mostly women, are still underpaid, unsafe and mistreated,” says Somers. “It’s time for change.”The director MJ Delaney has made a short video to spread the Fashion Revolution message. It features music by Richie Fermie and choreography by Christopher Bordenave. You may already have seen Delaney’s work – she made What I Really Really Want, a remake of the Spice Girls’ Wannabe video promoting gender equality for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and last year’s follow-up for International Day of the Girl, to the soundtrack of Beyoncé’s Freedom.Delaney’s film For Fashion Revolution uses various styles of dance to represent each step of the complex journey of a piece of clothing from cotton field to factory floor. Wear the Walk is the fashion equivalent of Netflix. Choose a one-off rental (starting at £30) for a special event, or a range of subscription services, starting at £60 per month, which allow you to choose two items and swap them each month (the fee includes dry-cleaning and insurance). This is a trend set to grow. According to a report by Allied Market, the global clothing rental market was worth $1bn (£700m) in 2017 and is estimated to reach $1.8bn by 2023.Of course, you can always freestyle. Make your wardrobe go further for free by taking part in swaps – there is one happening in Manchester on 27 April – or circulating parcels of clothes among your friends. Check out the tool kits to help you on your way at Global Fashion Exchange. Fashion Open Studio is a Fashion Revolution initiative that is – full disclosure – curated by me. A week-long series of events, workshops and talks, it is the opposite of a catwalk show. The public are invited to designers’ studios, where they can talk about how they make clothes, learn skills and even try making their own. Highlights include a talk by Vivienne Westwood’s head of couture and a visit to the Kent HQ of Elvis \u0026amp Kresse, to see how they are working with the Burberry Foundation on finding creative solutions for working with leather offcuts. Alternatively, try a repairs workshop with Christopher Raeburn, quilting from waste with Phoebe English or making your own clutch with Katie Jones and Wool and the Gang. To sign up for an event, visit Fashion Open Studio.De Castro says the small decisions we make every day are important. “Our wardrobes are a part of the fashion supply chain, so we can make a positive difference every morning when we get dressed,” she says. We have a responsibility to look after our clothes, wear them well, keep them in circulation and not throw them away after a few wears. We might even sew a button back on here and there mend a hole. We need to treat our clothes with respect and keep them in circulation so that, ultimately, we buy less, waste less, reduce the amount of textiles we are sending to landfill.Glasgow School of Art is hosting MEND, a workshop to learn how to repair your clothes, on 24 April. Also, De Castro will be with recent fashion and textiles graduates Matthew Needham and Maddie Williams, showing how to think creatively with existing clothes at Barnardo’s Brixton DiscoMAKE in London on 26 April. Tickets are available on Eventbrite.Truman Brewery in London will be a utopian parallel shopping universe this week, filled with brands and clothes you can trust. Organised by fair trade activist and pioneer Safia Minney, the founder of People Tree and now the CEO of vegan footwear brand Po-Zu shoes, there will be events, talks and guilt-free shopping. While you are there, you can invest in a pair of Po-Zu’s linen and pineapple “leather” sneakers, along with the latest collections by People Tree, knitwear by Lowie and menswear by Brothers We Stand. Ask any of them who made the clothes and they will be able to tell you. We hope that one day this will be the norm.

It covers everything from fair and equal pay to freedom of association for all workers to cultural ersity and transparency and accountability across the entire chain.De Castro says: “We want your signature to be a part of a global legacy, so that every time something is unjust, or people are exploited and the environment is degraded, you can reach back to it and reiterate that you can’t stand for abuse, you signed the manifesto, you are ready for change.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d76d89edc88d7c902e5961f751cc848478c067e/678_209_2318_1391/master/2318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f6057a1a7f0a1aad5ede7a729ae8c9","title":"verne troyer life in pictures","story":"Verne Troyer, who at 2ft 8in was one of the world’s shortest men, racked up 30 film credits in a career ning 24 years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6d1a9360eb6acb037160a76481002620850603/0_74_2962_1777/master/2962.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12c4bfc958be4ca7a4fcbbd1e0dd70d9","title":"champions league roma liverpool daniele de rossi steven gerrard","story":"Club captain has been with Roma for 16 years and is yearning to lead his hometown club into the final of the Champions LeagueDaniele De Rossi has waited a whole career to be part of a European night at Anfield. He was 18 the last time Roma played away to Liverpool, back in March 2002, newly promoted from the academy and with a handful of cup games for the senior team under his belt. This was not yet the time for the manager, Fabio Capello, to put his faith in precocious talent.Roma lost 2-0 and exited the Champions League. De Rossi went on to become one of the club’s most beloved stars. Before long fans were calling him Capitan Futuro – the Future Captain – destined to follow in Francesco Totti’s footsteps as the latest homegrown player to wear the armband.They were right, in the end, though few could have guessed that the transition would get pushed back all the way to 2017. It almost did not happen at all. There was a point, as negotiations over a contract renewal stalled last year, when De Rossi thought about seeking new experiences elsewhere.“In my own head I was playing out my last season,” he told the newspaper Corriere dello Sport in September. “The best offer that came in was from an Italian club but that didn’t get my juices flowing: I didn’t want to betray this city and these fans.“If an offer had come in from a European club or an American one – it’s no secret that it’s a dream of mine to have an experience of life and football over there – then probably we would not be here talking today.”Then again, who knows? De Rossi has had opportunities to leave before, and at times came close to accepting, but in the end his team and his city pulled him back in. His desires, like those of most human beings, contradict one another at times.As a boy he would watch tapes of Boca Juniors against River Plate at La Bombonera and fantasise about playing there. Yet he has always found great satisfaction in representing his hometown club. If he had not become a footballer, he remains convinced that he would have spent his weekends driving up and down Italy to watch Roma.Perhaps a night such as the one on Tuesday offers the best of both worlds. You can be sure that the Kop stirs the imagination of a man who named Steven Gerrard as his idol and the player he would select to captain his ideal XI.Not that De Rossi appears uncomfortable in that role. He has played less this season under Eusebio Di Francesco, granted more opportunities to rest in a midfield whose depth was enhanced over the summer by the signing of Maxime Gonalons from Lyon and the return of Lorenzo Pellegrini from Sassuolo. That freshness has served him in the biggest games.He was majestic in the quarter‑final second leg against Barcelona, setting up Edin Dzeko’s sixth-minute opener, converting the penalty for Roma’s second and dictating the terms of engagement. De Rossi played more passes than his midfield team-mates Kevin Strootman and Radja Nainggolan combined, almost always moving the ball forwards, and never losing possession.Before kick-off he had stood in front of his team-mates in the Stadio Olimpico changing room and asked why they should not overturn a three‑goal deficit against La Liga’s runaway leaders. “The fans think we can do it,” he observed. “So why not? Why should we stand here and shit ourselves?”There have been times when De Rossi might have struggled to feel such faith in himself, let alone project it to a whole team. From late 2015 into 2016 he suffered a series of niggling injuries that ate away at him mentally as well as physically. Even when he was on the pitch, his standard of play declined.It was the combined coaching prowess of Luciano Spalletti and Antonio Conte, in De Rossi’s opinion, that turned things round. The former returned to Roma in early 2016 and through his past familiarity with the player put him back in the right places and with mechanisms to succeed. The latter did what he has always done best, engaging the midfielder’s competitive spirit with Italy.“He electrified me,” De Rossi said of the man who is now Chelsea manager. “I’ve said it many times over: he really struck me.”The feeling is mutual, Conte speaking in glowing terms about the Roma captain before their teams clashed at Stamford Bridge in October. It was Capello, though, who paid De Rossi what might have been the most eloquent tribute of all, observing during one interview that “you cannot buy personality at the supermarket”.It takes a certain character just to survive for 16 years at Roma, where the media spotlight is never set to anything less than full glare. De Rossi has lived for much of his career in the centre of town, too, hiding in plain sight amid the tourists. Maybe one day he will take their lead, setting off to find somewhere new to explore. For now a Champions League semi-final will have to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/724f80aee1af1816c652d420d9e67894c2cce146/0_202_3974_2385/master/3974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=074ff94d6435a6c284e85d0c9c772cc1","title":"manchester united target full backs danny rose","story":"• José Mourinho ready to step up chase for Tottenham’s left-back• Rose has had difficult season after criticising Spurs’ transfer policyJosé Mourinho is targeting a right-back and left-back in the summer transfer market, with Manchester United’s manager hopeful of prising Danny Rose from Tottenham Hotspur.Mourinho is intent on upgrading each position, believing this will increase United’s prospects of mounting a serious challenge to the champions, Manchester City, next season.In December Mourinho pointed to City’s £100m-plus investment in Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy last summer, a sum he characterised as “full‑backs for the prices of strikers”.The Portuguese may have moved for Rose in January but the left-back was injured again following a 10-month layoff with a serious knee injury.Daniel Levy has a reputation for being a difficult negotiator and Tottenham’s chairman may be loathe to allow a sale of a prized asset to United, who he would consider a direct competitor.However, Walker was allowed to leave for Manchester City last summer for £53m – at the time a world-record fee for a defender – and Rose, who is under contract until 2021, would command a similar price.In August Rose signalled his disquiet at Spurs by stating he did not want the club to sign players “you have to Google”, and that the Doncaster-born footballer will play “up north” before he retires. Rose also stated he wanted to win trophies as time was running out for him – the 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat against United on Saturday means Spurs will again claim no silverware this year.While content with the contributions of Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, Mourinho’s first-choice right-back and left-back, Mourinho is conscious that each are in their 30s and are also both converted wingers.Valencia, the captain, is 33 in August and was a career attacker until the move to operate further back on a regular basis under Mourinho. Young is 33 in July and struggled for a berth in his usual left‑forward position until the Portuguese’s lack of faith in Luke Shaw and Matteo Darmian convinced him to utilise the England international in defence.Darmian, who can also play right-back, may depart in the close season, and while Mourinho would listen to offers for Shaw it is understood the 22-year-old may stay on and run down a contract that ends in July 2019. Then he could leave as a free agent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aabd0856ea34b2908b7a00bad553d3f36e9d6552/0_52_4736_2842/master/4736.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00d3499656b3dc371390290e7d10fea","title":"roma bunker liverpool storm champions league semi final","story":"Liverpool’s physicality and ferocious pressing mean the tactics that served Roma against Barcelona will have to be redesigned for the Champions League semi-final first legTwo problems dominate all others before Tuesday’s Champions League semi-final at Anfield – at least in determining how the game will be won. Can Roma stop Mohamed Salah and can Liverpool defend set plays?A key factor in Roma’s success against Barcelona was Eusebio Di Francesco’s switch to a 3-5-2, having fielded a 4-3-3 in every other game bar one this season. It not only wrong-footed Barcelona but meant Roma had three against two at the back and in midfield, something that was possible because the two wing-backs, Alessandro Florenzi and Aleksandar Kolarov, had the energy to drive back Barça’s wide men, Sergi Roberto and Andrés Iniesta. It forced them to defend rather than tucking in to offer support to the two central midfielders, Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic.That had two principal benefits. First it meant Juan Jesus could step with confidence from the backline to deal with Lionel Messi, knowing he always had two players behind him who had just one central forward, Luis Suárez, to contain. It also meant that at the back of midfield Daniele De Rossi, protected by Kevin Strootman and Radja Nainggolan, had time and space to make the play. And that is why this match will be so different from Roma’s task against Barça.Quite apart from anything else there is no chance that De Rossi will have as much time on the ball as he had then. The sight of him measuring his pass over the defence for Edin Dzeko in the second minute as no one closed him down should shame Barça. Whether that was a facet of their attitude or a conscious decision to release Suárez and Messi from defensive responsibility, it allowed Roma’s creative fulcrum to go about his business unchallenged. Roberto Firmino will not allow it.Liverpool will be aggressive, fearsomely so, in their press and how Roma handle that will go a long way to determining whether they have a chance in the game. The worry for Di Francesco must be the way Tottenham – after their dozy 10 minutes in Turin and before their dozy 10 minutes at Wembley – were able almost to bully Juventus in their last-16 meeting, something that confirmed the impression the Premier League is a different level from Serie A in terms of pace and power. Even more concerning must be the fact that, aggressively as Spurs press, Liverpool are far more ferocious. As well as everything else this will be a serious physical examination.As for shape, there would seem little obvious benefit for Di Francesco in opting for a back three again. It might conceivably offer greater defensive cover and, appealing as the thought of having Juan Jesus on the left of three central defenders to block Salah’s incursions from the Liverpool right may be, it causes far more problems elsewhere.Firmino’s habit of dropping deep means that having two players to pick him up is probably one and a half too many, while Sadio Mané’s pace makes him ideally suited to exploiting the space behind a wing-back. To play a back three would be to risk the wing-backs being driven back and it becoming a back five, which in turn would essentially surrender the flanks to Liverpool’s attack-minded full-backs, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson. And that would make certain a disparity that already seems likely in midfield, where Roma’s obvious quality risks being overrun by the greater pace and energy of whichever trio Jürgen Klopp selects. Di Francesco is more likely to opt for his familiar 4-3-3, sitting the back seven relatively deep to frustrate Liverpool.Dzeko, who has been in fine form, is the outlet, operating in a role in which he thrives as the roving lone front man, although Liverpool have been less vulnerable in the air since the arrival of Virgil van Dijk. Saturday’s draw against West Brom, albeit with a much-changed backline, demonstrated that foible has not entirely gone away. With Dzeko and Kostas Manolas on hand Roma have the aerial power to trouble Liverpool from set plays.The job of Roma’s wide men, two of Florenzi, Diego Perotti, Cengiz Ünder and Stephan El Shaarawy, is to support the midfield while shuttling forward to back up Dzeko. At the same time they must apply sufficient pressure on Alexander-Arnold and Robertson to make them at least slightly cautious about committing to attack.The danger for Roma is they end up overwhelmed, befuddled by an early Liverpool storm into retreating into a bunker. Although Roma have yet to concede at home in the Champions League this season, Liverpool are so lethal on the break there is a realistic expectation they will score at the Olimpico and that almost certainly means Roma will have to score at Anfield. As the Barça game proved, silly as the away goals rule is, it can be decisive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e3f5d2de6ba6e8bc63cd4759017acc1e8839f/0_141_7468_4481/master/7468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0eb99c94ee118c4b543284810550d7","title":"lieke martens barcelona ronaldinho","story":"The unusual girl playing football in the small Dutch town of Bergen in the late 90s does not know there is a women’s game. Instead her idol is Ronaldinho. Why? “Because I was a Barça fan,” says Lieke Martens. “He had long hair like me and great dribbles. I loved him. He was technical, made a lot of goals.”Watch the Netherlands and Barcelona midfielder, one can tell why she is a fan of the Brazilian great. Her Cruyff turn, back to goal, to take out two Belgium players, leaving one on the floor, as she drove forward at Euro 2017, is just a taste of her ability to trick and turn her way out of the tightest gaps with ease, à la Ronaldinho.The European Championship, hosted in her home country, catapulted Martens into the spotlight but in women’s football her talent was well known. With 20 goals in 29 games for Rosengard she could have had her pick of Europe’s top sides but, when the club of her childhood idol swooped, the decision was easy. “I played against Barcelona in the quarter-final of the Champions League with my previous club – the way they played I really liked it,” she says.With Barcelona’s investment in their women’s team a new development, the signing of Martens, the English forward Toni Duggan, María Pilar León from Atlético Madrid and Élise Bussaglia from the German champions, Wolfsburg, was a statement of intent. “I signed before the Euros,” Martens says. “For me it was really important to sign before, so I was clear in my head and free for the Euros.”Martens shone from the first whistle of the tournament and when her flighted pass from the corner of the box curved delightfully on to the head of Shanice van de Sanden to hand the Netherlands an opening victory over Norway, it was just the start.She was chosen in the team of the tournament, named player of the tournament and in the final she squeezed a shot between two Denmark players to give the Oranje Leeuwinnen (Orange Lionesses) a 2-1 lead after they had trailed to a sixth-minute Nadia Nadim penalty. “Playing a final is amazing,” she says. “There’s even more pressure but I really trusted the team.“When we went behind to the penalty I think we scored really quick, and then we got the lead, 2-1, then before half-time it was 2-2 and I remember at half-time we said to each other: ‘Come on girls, we really believe we’re going to do this’, and then we won 4-2. The trust in the team was so big during the tournament.”At no point did she believe they would fall short: “Even when we conceded one goal in the final, it was the first time we had gone behind, but I had no worries, nothing, that we would lose that game.”The Netherlands were outsiders, ranked 12th in the world. Germany, France and England were the favourites. So at what point did the Netherlands realise they could win it? “We felt good after the group stage – we had nine points, we won all the games. Yeah, I really felt then that something was possible. When we beat England 3-0 in the semi-final I thought: ‘Right, now we have to win this final.’”The team were embraced by the country. The opening match in Utrecht was attended by 21,732 fans and, as momentum built, a sea of orange would flood the streets before games. “That was amazing, the whole tournament was amazing,” Martens says. “The first game was sold out and during the tournament we got more and more people really happy and wanting to see us play. In Utrecht the big celebration day was amazing. We really felt the support the whole tournament.”It has not stopped – 30,238 watched the 7-0 win over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier in Eindhoven at the start of April. Martens, who has played for clubs in five different countries, won The Best Fifa Women’s Player award and Uefa Women’s Player of the Year award for 2017, and for the latter she flew to Monaco in a private plane with Lionel Messi before receiving the trophy alongside the men’s winner, Cristiano Ronaldo.Martens is focused on getting to France 2019 (the Netherlands are top of their qualifying group) and in the league on catching Atlético, who are one point ahead with five games to play. “We’re going to do everything to win – that’s all we can do. We are independent of them. I hope they are going to drop some points. It would be great to win the title in my first season in La Liga.”The girl who dreamed of being Ronaldinho is the poster girl for young female players in the Netherlands and elsewhere, and it is a role she does not take lightly. Martens will use any platform to show girls can play, and taking part in Uefa’s #PlayAnywhere competition (part of the @WePlayStrong campaign), which ends on 30 April, where girls post videos of themselves playing in unusual places, was a no-brainer. “When I was young,” she says, “I had no idea there were women players or what I could achieve and now we are role models. Of course I wanted to be involved.”• Jacqui Forster, founder of Women at the Game and former Supporters’ Direct worker, has died aged 55, nine years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. She founded Women at the Game, a group that encouraged and organised women going to live matches, during the later part of her battle with illness, using money crowdfunded by friends and former colleagues to help support her. Such was her unselfish passion. She also spent years working with supporters trusts up and down the country with Supporters’ Direct. A lifelong Altrincham fan, Jacqui’s enthusiasm was infectious and an inspiration, as discovered when interviewing her in October, two years after finding out her prognosis was “very short”.Five games into the NWSL last years table topper’s, North Carolina Courage (who missed out on the NWSL title to Portland Thorns in the league’s play-off final), are already stretching their legs. The unbeaten side are five points clear of Chicago Red Stars, though they needed an 80th-minute Crystal Dunn goal to rescue a point in their 2-2 draw with the new franchise Utah Royals (who are yet to win a game) on Saturday.• Brazil were crowned Copa America champions as Monica scored twice and benefited from an own goal in a 3-0 win over Colombia on Sunday. The Brazilians’ third consecutive title came after they topped the final group with three wins in three - they were also unbeaten in their first stage group. Brazil and Chile qualify for the 2019 World Cup while Argentina face a play-off against a Concacaf team for a spot in France.• Chelsea’s striker Fran Kirby won the women’s Players’ Player of the Year at the PFA awards on Sunday night. The England international has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season, including a double in the club’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City.

His large, wide-set eyes small, soft body and playful demeanor belie his maturity and emotional depth – attributes that become obvious once you get to know him. The truth is he’s about four, though the exact date of his birth, like that of many rescue dogs, is lost. He looks, to my eye, like some sort of a labrador-terrier mix, with a soulful amber gaze, spunky little foldy ears, and an itty-bitty little nosey. He is my friend and I love him.Until recently, though, his age and breed were up for debate. This was evidenced by an apparent dog expert at the local dog park on a recent morning. “No,” he said, shaking his head, after asking for the details of my dog. “My dog looked like that when she was a puppy, and now she looks like this.” He gestured to his large pit-bull-looking sweetie who, though beautiful, looked nothing like my little labrador-looking sweetie whom I love so much and for whom I would die. “Well … he’s about four,” I told him, hiding my annoyance well as I am extremely calm. “No. I don’t think so,” he said.The main reason I wanted to DNA test my dog was to shove the results in this rude man’s goddamn rude face, wherever he is. Probably hell!At-home dog DNA testing was made possible after the dog genome was sequenced in 2005 from the DNA of a female boxer named Tasha. Thank you, Tasha. This information provided a jumping-off point to map to the genomes of other dog breeds and their markers of genetic diseases, as well as some stuff about human diseases that frankly I do not think I should be the one to explain to you you may read about it here.“Of the more than 5,500 mammals living today, dogs are arguably the most remarkable,” said Eric Lander, senior author of the dog genome sequencing study and professor of biology at MIT. Agree. “The incredible physical and behavioral ersity of dogs – from chihuahuas to great danes – is encoded in their genomes. It can uniquely help us understand embryonic development, neurobiology, human disease, and the basis of evolution.” Wild stuff.For my at-home dog DNA test I picked Embark, which puts to use “over 20 times more genetic information than any other test on the market”, says Embark. The company uses more than 200,000 genetic markers to establish your dog’s breed, or breed mix, and more than 175 genetic health and trait tests to establish whether your dog is at risk for or a carrier of genetic disease. I chose Embark because I was not paying for it and it was the most expensive option ($189). Of the many tests currently on the market, Embark’s main competitor is Wisdom Panel 4.0 ($84.99), which only uses 2,000 genetic markers. Yeah, right. DNA My Dog ($68.98), the next-most-popular according to lists, doesn’t even give you a number of genetic markers it uses. Please.Embark’s kit comes with a swab. You hold the swab to the inside of your dog’s cheek for a few seconds, which they dislike very much, and then you put it into the sample tube, and then you send it back. They get the results to you in about two months, which is so long.May I tell you more about my dog? I’d like to, if you have a few hours. No? OK, I’ll make it slightly quicker. His name is Peter. Typically the more soft-hearted of humanity will, upon learning that his name is Peter, grasp their chest in delicious agony, as “Peter” is such a sweet name for such a gentle dog. Peter. The name came from Badass Brooklyn Animal Rescue, where I adopted him they give all of their dogs celebrity or otherwise famous names and his given name was “Peter Parker”. The “Peter” just seemed right. Peter.Before he was at Badass, he was a stray in south-east Georgia. The stray dog population is very large there, so Badass makes regular trips to bring back dogs to be adopted in New York. Peter was taken to a small kill shelter in a town called Mt Vernon, a place from which the Sweet Onion Animal Protection Society (Soaps) regularly tries to remove as many dogs as they can before the dogs are euthanized, to be placed into foster care and eventually adopted.While awaiting the results of Peter’s DNA test, I reached out to the Soaps director, Therisa Ingley, to see if the organization had any information about his pre-Brooklyn life. It had a little:“When Badass was visiting last February, we visited the shelter and they fell in love with Peter Parker. He had been picked up as a stray and had been there for awhile,” she said. “Very few dogs from shelters get adopted here because there are just so many. Badass fell in love with his gentle nature and he was pulled to go back with them.”He lived for about three years before I knew him. It really kills me that I was not able to protect him during that time, and that I’ll never really know what his life was like. However, I plan to teach him how to talk and I will update you once he tells me.Oh, you would like to know even more about Peter? If you insist. He has velvet ears. He has a spotted tongue. When he walks down the stairs, at his moderately paced gentleman’s trot, you can tell he’s a bit bow-legged. He has the heart of an angel and the soul of a poet, and there’s a hint of sadness to him that makes you want to protect him against all of the world’s harshness. He has whiskers that are so prominent they make you second-guess whether whiskers are a typical dog trait, or whether he could potentially be part mouse. He will sit his big, fat butt on your lap like he’s tiny, when he is actually 25 pounds. He’s affectionate, but not needy. “He’s just so ... kind,” is how a cousin of mine once described him, and it’s true: he’s just so kind. Also he loves to burrow under the covers, and he loves to sleep with his head on a pillow like a tiny little man.I wanted to know what he was because I want to know everything I can about him, and because I wanted to shove it in the face of any goddamn rude know-it-all men I came across in the future. But was there any other reason to get his DNA tested? I reached out to Ann Hohenhaus, staff doctor at New York City’s Animal Medical Center, to ask.“Well, I think that it depends,” she said. “You can use DNA testing for a lot of things. One thing is for fun.” (Meaning to find out what kind of a little sweetie my dog is.) “The second is that we’ve been using DNA tests in dogs for a long time to diagnose specific diseases … With a particular breed and a particular set of clinical signs, a DNA test may be a very efficient way to make a diagnosis in a patient.”While I was impatiently awaiting the results of my DNA test, this haunted me. What if the DNA test told me Peter was sick? He didn’t seem sick. But what if maybe he was going to be sick in the future? I also worried about how I would write around it in this piece. Maybe I would attempt to feature it as a poignant look at the impermanence of life, but, in contrast, the permanence of love – how his love will always be with me, and mine with him, no matter what. Luckily I do not have to travel down this thought-provoking road, because after six agonizing weeks of waiting, I received Peter’s impressive results:Peter tested clear for the 165 genetic conditions for which Embark scans, including 28 that are common in his breed mix, like congenital hypothyroidism, progressive retinal atrophy, and muscular dystrophy. Huh. “Not even at risk for any of them?” I wondered. “Did I do it wrong?” I wondered. “Is this wrong?” I asked Dr Hohenhaus.“I’m not surprised your dog was negative for those diseases, because those genetic diseases don’t occur very often in mixed-breed dogs,” she said. Oh. “That’s not to say they never do – I’ve diagnosed genetic disease in a mixed-breed dog. The disease normally occurred in the springer iel and this dog was a black-and-white shorthaired thing, and it had the same genetic mutation. But that’s the only time I’ve ever done that. So, it occurs but it’s rare.”Still, she said, there could be danger in taking negative results of the at-home swab test as gospel. The tests typically look for a single mutation, and if your dog’s disease (say pyruvate kinase deficiency, which has several mutations across different breeds) has a mutation that hasn’t been discovered yet – even if he presents symptoms that would be obvious to a veterinarian – the test won’t catch it. Plus, a cheek swab test means a bacteria-laden sample: “When I do DNA testing, I take a blood sample and send it in. And a blood sample is inherently ‘cleaner’, in quotes, than if you do a home DNA test with a cheek swab,” Honenhaus told me. “So that test has some inherent issues, because you have the DNA of the bacteria in the dog’s mouth along with the dog’s DNA, in that sample. And so I think that there is probably an opportunity for a sample that’s harder to read if there’s a lot of bacteria in the mouth. So, DNA testing labs, I’m certain, would prefer to have a blood sample. I think really the at-home DNA testing is not as much for disease as it is for the fun.”Yes, this checks out. Mostly what you’re looking for when you’re giving your dog a DNA test you ordered from the internet, I believe, is the fun of finding out the fun little mystery of who he is. Speaking of the fun little mystery of who he is, do you want to know what my dog is? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you ready? Here, look at this photo of him so you can guess before you know:Do you have your guess? OK. Here it is:He is, as you can see, so many things. Peter. (A “supermutt” means, according to Embark, that there may be “small amounts of DNA from these distant ancestors”: chow chow, dalmatian, and miniature pinscher.) Here he is. The basic structure of a labrador retriever. The smaller stature of a chihuahua. The intelligent, calm demeanor of a golden retriever. The love for burrowing of the small-prey hunter dachshund. The wide-set eyes and expressive ears of a rat terrier. The sociability of the miniature schnauzer. The wide chest and slightly bowed back legs of the American staffordshire terrier. The spotted tongue of the chow chow.He is, according to the test, about 36 in people years – roughly four years old.I asked Dr Hohenhaus if there was anything practical to be gleaned from learning the breeds that go into a mutt, and she wasn’t sure the evidence was out there – yet. “I think that two years from now you’ll write a different article than you’ll write today. Because this is an area of expansion and growth, and we’ll know better how to use the fact that your dog, although he only weighs 25lb, is part labrador, we’ll know better how to use that information,” she said.I look forward to this day. But for now, at least I know how I’ll use this information: against rude men who think they know more about my dog than I do at the dog park.Looking for more great work from the Outline, an online publication focused on power, culture, and the future?

I caught the first train in and was the only one on the carriage! I arrived just before 7am to a queue already several hundred people long. Great atmosphere, people of all ages, genders and haircuts. Two hours later and I’m in! I managed to grab everything I was after – The National’s Boxer, Ride’s Weather Diaries remixed, some Cure albums, a Steven Wilson 12” and a rather lovely remix of Yazoo’s Situation. Getting up early and getting involved in RSD is becoming something of a yearly ritual ... but, when the oat latte at Rough Trade East is this good, what else can you do? It was an early start at the crack of dawn this morning, to be near the front of the queue. With a list as long as your arm and a head full of music, I headed off to Jam Records in Falmouth. This year I was 12th in line – one worse than last year. The atmosphere in line was jovial with everyone discussing music in general but without giving away what was on their lists – a closely guarded secret. This year I met Max, ex-RAF Regiment and an offshore oil rig worker, who bought me a coffee. In between I was texting my son who I don’t see so often now as he moved to Brighton last year. Record Store Day gives us the opportunity to take part in something together, even though we’re miles apart, and we share lists on the basis that I might be able to get a title that isn’t available in Brighton and vice versa. The doors in Falmouth opened at 10am, and there was a surge to get in, with everyone being careful not to stand on the shop’s resident black labrador, sat casually in the doorway. There’s no system at Jam Records, at least not one I can see – Mandy, the shop owner, displays the records prominently, and lets customers get on with it. This translates into 60 seconds of madness as the queue surges between the wall mounts and the central display tables, effectively funnelling customers into a vinyl-frenzied conga line around the store. Nothing beats Record Store Day for the exhilaration of being in the moment, being part of the hunt for the tunes that are going to change your life. This year, despite the frenzy, I walked away with a decent haul, made even sweeter by Friels Cider, the 2018 sponsor, who picked me as one of the lucky winners of their competition. They kindly gave me a £50 voucher to help with this year’s bill, which can get a bit pricey if you get carried away. My shortlist ran to about £1,200, so I had to cut it down three times to get it to something I could justify on the basis that vinyl is important but so is food. That said, Record Store Day is but once a year, and what I ended up with this year was a copy of Grant Green’s Slick! Live at Oil Can Harry’s album the classic Marvin Gaye’s Let’s Get It On album, together with a red vinyl copy of Sexual Healing: The Remixes The Doors Live at the Matrix album the Abbey Road version of the Amorphous Androgynous album The Isness and the Now album from the inimitable David Bowie. With that, plus the Allman Brothers album that’s winging its way from Brighton courtesy of my son, I think I did pretty well this year. Can’t wait for 2019! I queued for five and a half hours at Banquet Records in Kingston. I managed to pick up everything I wanted (Run the Jewels, Ride, Brian Zeno, Erased Tapes, and Parquet Courts). The vibe in the queue was amazing, everyone was socialising and talking releases. Can’t wait for next year! The queue outside VOD Music, the smallest independent record shop in the UK, began before 8pm on Friday night and here are the first eight hardy souls preparing for the night’s vigil. Bowie, Led Zeppelin, The Lovely Eggs – who knows what’s on their want list this year? Whatever it is, the day will be completed with a breakfast and more crate-digging and live music by Sendelica and Kavus Torabi in Mold record fair. I got to Eel Pie Records in Twickenham at 6.45 this morning and joined the queue. I was 15th in line seven people had camped out overnight! The atmosphere was brilliant, everyone was so friendly and passionate about music. The waiting time flew by thanks to the pleasant conversations. I was surprised at how male-dominated the queue was – apart from me there were only two other women out of over 100 people. When I finally got into the shop it was much calmer than I expected, the 10 person at a time limit definitely eliminated any pushing. I managed to get the three things I really wanted: Hans Zimmer’s Blue Planet II soundtrack, Goldie Presents: 25 Years of Goldie Unreleased and Remastered, and Soul Jazz Records Presents: Studio One Dub Plates Specials. This was my first Record Store Day and my first time shopping at Eel Pie Records – I’ll definitely be returning there again soon!

If that sounds strange, it’s probably worth mentioning that it wasn’t just any version of Africa. Rather, it was a YouTube remix by a 20-year-old from Wisconsin who goes by the name Cecil Robert, who imagined its soft rock cheese ringing out across an empty shopping mall, with a stock image of a concourse accompanying the video. The clip – uploaded late last year – has had more than 1.3m views to date. Somehow, in this new setting (translation: heavily reverbed to within an inch of its life), its naffness gives way to deeper things: nostalgia, loss, stillness. “Is this an experience of modern art and anthropology to demonstrate the emptiness that fills our dreams and moral values?” asks one commenter. “Deep shit,” comes the reply.“I think there’s almost a sense of dread in the mall edits,” says Robert. “This is a place that should be full of people and noise. It feels like you’re somewhere you shouldn’t be.”Africa isn’t the only song getting this kind of treatment online, however. In recent months, versions of songs “heard from a bathroom at a house party”, “in an empty shopping mall” or in umpteen other locales have moved from Tumblr niche to YouTube hits, with new accounts springing up and creators messing with everyone from Paramore to Elvis Presley. Some of Robert’s remixes take the viewer outside the gates of sold-out concerts, while another user, allyson.m, has merged the sound of a train journey with songs by the Strokes and US indie band the Neighbourhood. Meanwhile, From Another Room specialises in versions of songs heard exclusively through walls. The overall effect of such remixes is one of outsiderdom. “I think it triggers something we’ve all experienced at some point,” says Robert. “Whether it’s sold-out tickets, parents not letting you go to a concert, hearing the music from the party down the street that you weren’t invited to … everybody has felt left out. But with these videos, it’s like we’re all coming together to experience being alone.”For Robert, the past – both real and imagined – is a key component to his work. However, at a time when nostalgia feels increasingly like a commodity, you could argue that someone who was born in the late-90s editing a video of a-ha’s Take on Me to sound like “the olden days” is surely the hellish apogee of our obsession with the past. The majority of these remixes, though, don’t feel incongruous they seamlessly tap into a very specific type of media culture. They offer the kind of music that resembles diegetic sound in a film or TV show: that is, the sound that naturally occurs within that world as opposed to a soundtrack. For example, it’s easy to imagine allyson.m’s version of Wonderwall – complete with rain and thunder – playing in the background of an early-00s teen drama like The OC. “In these videos, music creates ambient textures that give listeners a sense of space that the internet doesn’t provide us,” says Scott Wark, a researcher in meme theory at the University of Warwick. “These memes create a feeling not only of being in another space, but in another time when particular songs that we listened to sounded a certain way.”Arguably, there’s something of weird internet humour in the mix, too, especially with videos such as Beck’s Truckdrivin’ Neighbors Downstairs (Yellow Sweat) with the sound of a truckers’ diner in the background. However, Wark sees a key difference between this and other musical trends online, like polished, drum machine-heavy 80s-style remixes or much-memed songs such as Smash Mouth’s All Star. “What’s interesting about this meme is that it’s the gesture of taking a song with an already strong nostalgic charge and making it fit the parameters of the meme, rather than creating meme parameters out of an already existing song,” he says. “The songs don’t matter as much as the textures – of spaces, sounds, times, youth, etc – that can be woven out of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a7e76a0d35c8fc00f68818914b2e68bdd6d6f2/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c651666e3f6dbe7b0f07170c0c94519","title":"aleksandr kogan cambridge analytica facebook data business ventures","story":"The story of Aleksandr Kogan’s business ventures reveals a world where companies traded in the currency of personal information As Aleksandr Kogan goes before parliament on Tuesday to account for his role in the controversial harvesting of Facebook data that was later used by Cambridge Analytica, he leaves behind him two unsuccessful companies and a once-promising academic career.Kogan was a young psychologist fresh off a post-doctoral fellowship when he earned an appointment as a lecturer at Cambridge University in 2012 – a coup for any academic. Just six years later, the erstwhile Dr Spectre has been maligned in the press, mocked for his eccentric name change, and banned from the social network that he thought would provide him with the data to advance his research. He has also brought unwelcome scrutiny of Cambridge University’s other researchers, prompting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to tell the US Congress that the company is looking into “whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall”. In a recent interview with 60 Minutes, Kogan apologised for his role in the controversy, saying: “I think that the core idea we had – that everybody knows, and nobody cares – was wrong. For that, I am sincerely sorry.”The story of Kogan’s commercial ventures reveals a world where companies traded in the currency of personal data. As Kogan declined to speak on the record with the  for this article, this account is based on public records, interviews with Kogan’s associates, and emails seen by the .It was at Cambridge, home of the renowned Psychometrics Centre, that Kogan became the crucial link between SCL Elections (an entity related to Cambridge Analytica) and Facebook’s vast troves of personal data. Two other Cambridge researchers, Dr Michal Kosinski and Dr David Stillwell, had pioneered the use of Facebook data for psychometric research with a Facebook quiz application, the myPersonality quiz, which launched in 2007. Kogan built his own personality quiz application in 2013, and used it for academic research, according to an email he sent to Cambridge colleagues in March.Kogan was introduced to SCL Elections in January 2014 by a Cambridge psychology PhD student, according to emails seen by the .SCL offered Kogan the holy grail for a social scientist: money to pay people to take his surveys. And Kogan had something SCL wanted: a Facebook application that worked under the social network’s pre-2014 terms of service, which allowed app developers to harvest data not only from the people who installed the app, but from their friends. “New applications are not able to access friend networks and no other psychometric profiling applications exist under the old Facebook terms,” the contract that SCL and Kogan’s company ultimately signed reads. Between that first meeting and 4 June 2014, when the contract was signed, Kogan tried to recruit Stillwell and Kosinski to work on the SCL project with him. The negotiations broke down, and John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, accused Kogan of using Kosinski’s and Stillwell’s ideas for a “get rich quick” scheme. Kogan denied the charges, defending his work as original and accusing Rust in turn of “bullying”.Speaking to the  on a previous occasion, Kogan said: “When we initially envisioned doing the project with SCL, we had planned for it to be collaboration with Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell at the Psychometrics Centre. “Even though I very much wanted to work with Michal and David, SCL felt that their position of a fee of $500,000 for the modelling portion of the project was not warranted. And so SCL asked me to remove Michal and David from the project.“John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, then made a complaint to the university on behalf of Michal and David … and even though the university’s investigation resulted in no support for John’s claims, I still lost valuable collaborators that I enjoyed working with.“In the end, I believe the Psychometrics Centre wanted to get back on the project, even though SCL had moved on based on their negative experience with them.”At the end of May 2014, Kogan established the company, Global Science Research Ltd (GSR) that signed the contract with SCL Elections. Kogan’s co-director of GSR, and a witness to the contract’s execution, was Joseph Chancellor, a post-doctoral student in Kogan’s lab who is currently employed by Facebook. Kogan described Chancellor as an equal partner in the enterprise to 60 Minutes, saying: “We did everything together”. A spokesman for Facebook defended the company’s disparate treatment of the business partners, saying of Chancellor: “His work at Facebook is unrelated to what he did previously.”Despite Rust’s accusations, the contract did not offer any financial remuneration to Kogan and Chancellor. Instead, they would be rewarded with data – both the Facebook data and an additional dataset of 1 million citizens of Trinidad and Tobago – which they would go on to attempt to spin into both academic and commercial gold.  understands that Kogan never received the Trinidad and Tobago dataset.In August 2014, GSR added another director, who described himself as the chief financial officer and co-founder of GSR on his LinkedIn profile in December 2014.“The company owns a massive data pool of 40+ million iniduals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles,” the LinkedIn profile stated at the time. The profile described two products being offered by GSR: Peek, a tool to help businesses understand the “psychological, economic, ethnographic knowledge” profiles of their customer bases, and SurveyExtender, a tool to forecast survey results. When the  contacted Kogan in December 2014, he affirmed by email that GSR was developing the two products, which he compared, respectively, to CubeYou and SurveyMonkey. (Facebook suspended CubeYou from its platform in April 2018, following inquiries about data usage from CNBC).It would be another year before the  published an article revealing that Cambridge Analytica was using the Facebook data to target voters for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign. In the meantime, Kogan continued to work with the Facebook data, both for academic research and for GSR, which had a website promoting its tools to “optimise marketing strategies with the power of big data and psychological sciences”. He maintained a close relationship with Facebook, which provided him with an anonymised, aggregate dataset of 57 billion Facebook friendships for research purposes. He told 60 Minutes: “I even did a consulting project with Facebook in November of 2015, and what I was teaching them was lessons I learned from working with this dataset that we had collected for Cambridge Analytica, so I was explaining, ‘Here’s kinda what we did, and here’s what we learned, and here’s how you could apply it internally to help you with surveys and survey predictions and things like that.’”In June 2015, Kogan also established a Delaware corporation, Philometrics, which remains active and of which he is CEO. Chancellor resigned as a director of GSR in September 2015 and was hired by Facebook a few months later. According to public documents, however, he remained a partial owner of the company through May 2016. After the ’s publication of the December 2015 exposé, Facebook contacted Kogan and required him to delete the GSR data. The company also ceased collaborating with Kogan on research related to the 57 billion friendship data set. The end result was a major setback for Kogan and especially his graduate students, who had to abandon about 18 months of work.In March 2016, Kogan wrote to Rust and Stillwell of the Psychometrics Centre to request access to the myPersonality dataset for one of his PhD students, who had been using the GSR dataset for his dissertation, according to emails seen by the . Rust rejected Kogan’s appeal, writing: “I think it completely inappropriate that we should have anything more to do with you or your companies.”With Kogan’s academic career sputtering, he appears to have turned his attention to building SurveyExtender into a viable product, now under the auspices of Philometrics.  understands that the version of SurveyExtender marketed by Philometrics did not use the GSR Facebook data. Kogan moved to San Francisco, though he has maintained his position at Cambridge in order to supervise his remaining PhD students. His company attracted the attention of at least one investor, the media monitoring firm Meltwater. In his 2017 book Outside Insight, Meltwater’s founder Jørn Lyseggen interviewed Kogan, who was using his married name, Alex Spectre, at the time. Lyseggen describes Philometrics as a “pioneer” in the realm of garnering consumer insights and competitive intelligence from social media data.In October 2017, GSR was dissolved. That same month, Kogan registered a UK business, Philometrics Ltd, of which Kogan was CEO and the US Philometrics was the sole shareholder. Kogan and at least one of his employees worked out of Meltwater’s San Francisco office for a time. A spokeswoman for Meltwater confirmed that the company is a minority investor in Philometrics and that a Philometrics employees “contributed time on an internal Meltwater pilot project attempting to predict future values of cryptocurrencies”.The company appears to have soured on Kogan, however. “Meltwater invested in Philometrics because of Alex Spectre’s impressive background as a professor from Cambridge University and the prospect of him recruiting valuable talents he knew from Cambridge,” a spokeswoman told the  by email. “There were no Facebook data in the company Meltwater invested in.”She continued: “Alex never succeeded in building Philometrics into a successful company. As far as we understand Philometrics is today a company with very limited operations and employees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a2e9fe5018d76cc5bc186f5cc2872d7070f8872/0_63_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00038d3a968f8d175853dd67eee57b31","title":"labour government would hold amritsar raid inquiry corbyn vows","story":"Labour leader promises independent inquiry into Britain’s alleged role in Indian army’s 1984 raid on Golden TempleAn independent inquiry into Britain’s military role in the Indian army’s 1984 raid on the Golden Temple in Amritsar will be launched under a Labour government, Jeremy Corbyn has said.The Labour leader promised that an investigation into the attack, which is said to have left thousands of people dead, would be in the party’s next manifesto.Sikh groups have repeatedly called for a fresh inquiry into an apparent decision by Margaret Thatcher’s government to send an SAS officer to Delhi to advise the Indians on the operation.David Cameron ordered his most senior civil servant to investigate alleged British involvement in 2014. He found that the advice was ignored by the Indian army, which launched a full-scale ground assault, causing a heavy loss of life.The finding was met with “disappointment” by British Sikh groups, and the Sikh Federation said Sir Jeremy Heywood’s review had been “limited in scope”.Corbyn, speaking at a Sikh Federation event in Watford, said: “You can be very sure that, whenever the election comes, it will be in the next manifesto ... it’s a commitment that’s going to be there and we will honour that commitment.” It came as Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Ooffice’s most senior civil servant, apologised after describing the Golden Temple, one of the most revered in the Sikh religion, as a mosque on Twitter.After realising the error, the permanent secretary said: “I was wrong: I am sorry. I should of course have said the Golden Temple or, better, Sri Harmandir Sahib.” However, Bhai Amrik Singh, the chairman of the Sikh Federation, said: “This was a major gaffe by a top civil servant and totally unacceptable. It demonstrates a remarkable level of ignorance from someone in his position.” He added: “In our view, a public apology and admitting the mistake is not enough. What we need is a commitment from the UK government and senior civil servants to root out such ignorance and discrimination or we will continue to face hate, abuse and threats of violence.” The error is particularly sensitive given the suspicions that exist around the extent of UK involvement in the 1984 raid. The temple had been occupied by militants under the command of a seminary student turned extremist, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who called for an independent homeland for the Sikh minority of predominantly Hindu India.Many hundreds, possibly thousands, were killed in the assault. They included Bhindranwale himself as well as Sikh and Hindu pilgrims caught in the crossfire. The temple was badly damaged.The botched operation, in which 136 Indian soldiers also died, led to the assassination of the prime minister, Indira Gandhi, by her Sikh bodyguards, which in turn provoked massacres of Sikhs. About 3,000 were stabbed, burned or beaten to death by mobs in Delhi, the capital, alone.Gandhi’s Operation Blue Star horrified moderate Sikhs and in its aftermath, Punjab, the north-western state that is their historic homeland, was plunged into a violent insurgency that lasted almost a decade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef5dd5c69a27c6ae8b8949aac4e9f0dc7010a51/128_0_1512_907/master/1512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49f9f29f27afa25e1c5b9c55fc5fd0c3","title":"cambridge analytica kogan barnier says eu needs more clarity from uk over its brexit demands politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenIf the goal is for you to run Facebook ads, the friends data is useless.Kogan says what people say about the accuracy of this data is grossly misleading.He offers to present his slide.Damian Collins does not sound keen, but says the committee will treat them as written evidence.Kogan is now summarising the points he made in his written evidence. See 11.58am and 12pm.The idea that this data is accurate is scientifically ridiculous.He explains how people can use Facebook now to target ads. He says people can go to Facebook and ask Facebook to Facebook to build them a lookalike audience.The predictions made about personality are very noisy, he says (meaning they included people they should not have included.)Q: What was the value of the project you were doing for SCL?Given what we know now, nothing.Q: Why was Facebook data so important to you?Kogan says, as a social psychologist, he is interested in understanding people. But researchers tend to focus on undergraduate psychology students. That is cheap. But they are not representatives.He says Facebook offered two advantages. He says they has a relatively open API (application programming interface). And he says the sample was representative. It covered most of the population.Q: Can you tell us about your work with AggregateIQ?There is nothing to tell, says Kogan. He says he had not heard of them until about a month ago.Q: How many companies did you share the data with?Kogan says it went to SCL, to Christopher Wylie’s company Eunoia (which he says received the largest amount of data), to Cambridge University (which just got an anonymised version) and to a researcher at the University of Toronto (who just got a derivative dataset.)Kogan says he thinks he has deleted the Facebook data.But he is checking to make sure that some data has not been missed. For example, in a summary file.But he says you cannot stop people putting data on a hard drive and putting it under a mattress.He says this has been a painful process. Facebook was a close ally, he says. He says what has happened has been damaging to his career.Q: Were you the only one under a non-disclosure agreement from Facebook? Or were your directors covered too?Kogan says they will have to ask Facebook.Q: When was it signed?Kogan says he cannot say.He says that parliamentary privilege (which protects people speaking in parliament from legal action) does not extend to the US.Q: And can you confirm that you don’t have any Facebook data any more?Kogan says that is correct, as far as he is aware.Kogan say he is under a non-disclosure agreement with Facebook.You’ll have to ask Facebook.Kogan says by March 2015 his firm had begun to suspect that Christopher Wyle, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, “might not be the most reputable person in the world”.He says Wylie had not been a reliable partner.Aleksandr Kogan used his written evidence to the select committee to claim that the personality data he provided to directly to SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, was “highly inaccurate” and of little use for targeting iniduals with Facebook adverts.The Cambridge university lecturer ran a company which was paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by political campaign group SCL in 2014 and 2015 to collect personality data on inidual Facebook users.He now insists the information provided was far from accurate when it came to successfully predicting an inidual’s views based on their Facebook activity.In a document submitted ahead of his appearance, the data scientist claimed that “the scores were more accurate than a random guess, but less accurate than assuming everyone is average on every trait.”Kogan also claimed that Facebook’s own in-house advertising system was a more effective way of targeting iniduals than using the personality data his company had collected. “I believe the project we did makes little to no sense if the goal is to run targeted ads on Facebook,” he told the committee. The Facebook ads platform provides tools and capability to run targeted ads with little need for our work – in fact, the platform’s tools provide companies a far more effective pathway to target people based on their personalities than using scores from users from our work.Labour’s Paul Farrelly asks about an interview that Kogan gave to 60 Minutes in the US.Q: You accept that you broke Facebook’s terms and conditions?No, says Kogan. He says, to break a policy, it has to exist. You cannot describe what was in the Facebook document as a policy.I would agree my actions were inconsistent with the language of this document. But that is slightly different.Kogan challenges Farrelly. Is Farrelly on Facebook? Yes, the MP says. And did he read the terms and conditions first? No, says Farrelly.Kogan says that he accepts he failed in drawing up the user terms and conditions for his app.He should have made it clear that the information might be used for political purposes, he says.And, in his written statement (pdf), Kogan also says that Facebook can run targeted ads without the need for his data.A second point of confusion is whether the data we collected would be useful for micro-targeting ads on Facebook. I believe the project we did makes little to no sense if the goal is to run targeted ads on Facebook. The Facebook ads platform provides tools and capability to run targeted ads with little need for our work—in fact, the platform’s tools provide companies a far more effective pathway to target people based on their personalities than using scores from users from our work.In his written statement (pdf) Kogan says that the personality scores he provided to SCL were “highly inaccurate”.Kogan says he did not know what candidates in America SCL was working for. He says he rarely has strong opinions about election candidates. He goes on:Most folks are trying to do what they think is right.Damian Collins puts to Kogan some of the things Alexander Nix, the Cambridge Analytica CEO (currently suspended) told the committee when he gave evidence.Q: Nix said he did not get any data from GSR. He said no. Is that true?Q: Nix said you did not supply him with data.Q: Nix says his datasets are not based on what you supplied.Kogan says that could be true. He does not know what is in the SCL datasets now. But they did have his data originally.Q: So as far as you are concerned Nix lied to the committee?And here is more from Kogan’s written statement (pdf) about the data GSR supplied to SCL.In late 2014, GSR provided SCL with the data and analyses called for by the Agreement. This consisted of (i) demographic information for survey participants and their friends in the 11 specified states and (ii) personality scores and a limited number of predictions for survey participants and friends based on the collected data. SCL later requested that we provide data and analysis for survey participants and their friends for all 50 states. In early 2015, we provided the additional data requested by SCL. This second set of data contained the same types of demographic information, survey responses, but fewer personality analyses than those that had been provided for the original 11 states that had been turned over pursuant to the Agreement. In addition, for the second set of data, SCL requested information on whether the friends and survey participants had “likes” for about 500 pages specified by SCL, which included some political figures and celebrities. GSR provided this additional “like” data, which amounted to about four percent of each friend’s “likes.” SCL also requested and received information on who people were friends with (social network connections). In return for the second set of data, SCL paid GSR £230,000. These funds were used by GSR for research, development, administrative costs, and professional services. I did not receive any salary from GSR at any point during its operation.Kogan says he thinks it is unlikely that SCL used Facebook data on the Trump campaign.He says he thought the Ted Cruz campaign were unhappy with the data that SCL were using. So he does not think SCL would have gone on to use that data on the Trump campaign.Q: Facebook said you had lied to them and misused their data. Do those comments apply to Joseph Chancellor, who worked with you?Q: But that’s odd, because Chancellor went on to work for them.Kogan says that might not be odd in Facebook land.He says Facebook was in “PR crisis mode” when it put out statements criticising his fole in the affair. He goes on:I don’t believe they think these things.He says he thinks Facebook knows their platformed had been mined by others too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa1c4407483f15d5a199d6893b67c1aa915632b8/0_205_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9794430618dda99c6b7ccb88244a7491","title":"disabled politicians elections fund","story":"Ahead of local elections, three would-be politicians are fighting to get the government to reinstate a fund that helps them get out on the campaign trailWith only a week to go until the local elections in many parts of England, there’s one electoral shakeup the government wasn’t counting on: the fight for equality for disabled politicians. This month, three would-be MPs from across the political spectrum – each of them with a disability – launched a legal challenge against the government to force it to reinstate the access to elected office fund, the £2.6m pot of money intended to help disabled candidates campaign on an equal footing to any non-disabled rival.To really understand why this matters, we need to go back to 2012 when the fund was launched. For three years, disabled candidates were offered grants of between £250 and £40,000 to help meet any potential additional costs incurred in standing for election as a local councillor or MP. The money could be used for anything from assistive technology for blind people, to a British Sign Language (BSL) interpreter, or a mobility car.But in 2015, the government froze the fund. This happened just as ministers brought in a range of policies that disproportionately hurt disabled people. Three years later, the fund is still “under review”. This is despite the Green party’s Caroline Lucas leading calls by MPs from across the political spectrum in 2016 for the fund to be reinstated “as a matter of urgency” and a recommendation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission for it to reopen.During last year’s general election, I reported on the consequences of freezing the fund for candidate Mary Griffiths Clarke, who has ME and was living out of her agent’s caravan because she couldn’t afford a hotel, and Emily Brothers, who is blind and hard of hearing, and was unable to run again because she had no way to pay a sighted guide to help her on the campaign trail.It was this that led Brothers to be part of the legal case launched this month, led by the campaign group More United. The others are Liberal Democrat David Buxton, who was Britain’s first ever deaf candidate who used sign language in his 1997 campaign, and Simeon Hart, who is also deaf and stood for the Green party in Oldham West and Royton for the 2015 byelection. Because the access fund had just been closed, Hart had to crowdfund to help raise more than £4,500 that he needed to hire a BSL interpreter for three weeks.\u0026nbspThere’s a risk that any push to finance politicians (or would-be ones) will be greeted with public scepticism. Even years after the expenses scandal, MPs getting subsidised dinners while low income children lose free school meals, for example, understandably cause ire. But just as sensible expenses for MPs prevent a situation in which only the wealthiest citizens are able to take power ,\u0026nbspThere’s good reason for disabled candidates who incur extra costs to have financial support. The access fund means\u0026nbspdisabled would-be politicians have the same shot at gaining office as their non-disabled counterparts. Remove it and many disabled people cannot run for election at all.The fight for the access to elected office fund is about fairness – but really, it’s as much about what sort of politics we want. Too often, white, non-disabled, wealthy men dominate power because of their advantage, not merit. Strip disability funding away and we simply lose more talented would-be politicians. This legal case may ensure that, come the next election, the only thing that matters is who’s the best candidate for the job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96b5ca75c76c48827dea05932bd5be727931904/0_205_6964_4179/master/6964.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f2938e405574a0a3fe3fd077548147","title":"food bank use trussell trust universal credit figures","story":"Vulnerable people left with “nowhere else to turn” after experiencing problems with universal credit helped fuel a big increase in food bank use over the past year, according to the Trussell Trust.The trust said many universal credit claimants had come to food banks after long waits for payment and administrative problems pushed them into debt, ill health and rent arrears.“This completely unacceptable. We need to move towards a UK where no one needs a food bank’s help, not a country where charity provision is the only defence from utter destitution,” said Emma Revie, the trust’s chief executive.Research into the experiences of food bank users published by the trust on Tuesday found a “significant scale” of poor benefits administration, coupled with widespread evidence that universal credit provided insufficient income to cover basic living costs.Claimants reported they found the digital-only universal credit service hard to navigate, with little or no official support or financial assistance to help them cope or tide them over a minimum six-week wait for a first payment. Several told the trust that lack of money meant they had been forced to give up a home internet connection or smartphone, making it harder to access the benefit.The report says: “Rather than acting as a service to ensure people do not face destitution, the evidence suggests that for people on the very lowest incomes … the poor functioning of universal credit can actually push people into a tide of bills, debts and, ultimately, lead them to a food bank.“People are falling through the cracks in a system not made to hold them. What little support available is primarily offered by the third sector, whose work is laudable, but cannot be a substitute for a real, nationwide safety net.”The trust called for an urgent inquiry into the administration of universal credit and an end to the benefits freeze, as well as more practical help for the poorest claimants.The trust surveyed 284 users of 30 food banks in England, Scotland and Wales during February and March. Disabled people, claimants affected by chronic health conditions and families with dependent children were especially vulnerable to problems arising from the design or operation of universal credit.The Department for Work and Pensions criticised the survey as a “small self-selecting sample” carried out before a series of changes came into force designed to mitigate the impact of universal credit, such as reducing the minimum wait for a first payment to five weeks and providing two weeks’ extra housing support for claimants moving on to the benefit.Ministers were forced to introduce the changes last year after sustained criticism from campaigners, landlords, opposition parties and even Conservative backbenchers.The trust said the fastest-growing group of food bank users over the past year was made up of people reliant on benefits for income, suggesting the government’s freeze on social security benefits for the past two years was making it increasingly hard for the poorest to meet basic living costs.Revie said: “It’s hard to break free from hunger if there isn’t enough money coming in to cover the rising cost of absolute essentials like food and housing. For too many people, staying above water is a daily struggle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad806ae3f0dee2bf55db8817cf1a99861aa2939a/0_86_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1ae67de1f73d890ddb48cb77bf0c18","title":"mo farah london marathon return 2019","story":"London Marathon organisers are already lining up Mo Farah to run in next year’s race while his coach, Gary Lough, believes he could yet reach a “similar level” as the winner this year, Eliud Kipchoge.The 35-year-old Farah is yet to decide on his next race over 26.2 miles but the likelihood is he will choose an autumn marathon in Chicago or New York – with Dubai in January an outside bet – before returning to the British capital next April. It is a prospect which one senior London Marathon figure told the  they “would love to see happen”.Lough believes the performance on Sunday showed that, while Kipchoge – who has not lost since 2013 – is the greatest in history, Farah is capable of putting him under pressure by running a time of 2hr\u0026nbsp3min or 2:04 in the future.“Eliud is the best marathon runner ever,” Lough said. “But I think Mo can get to a similar level – of being either one or two in the world. And if you put him into a championship environment, like next year in the world championships in Doha or certainly the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, I definitely think Mo should be someone people have got major concerns about. He wants to be the best that he can be – and that is going to be one of the best in the world.”Farah’s agent, Ricky Simms, meanwhile, has dismissed any suggestions that the runner’s former coach Alberto Salazar, who remains under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency, played any part in the 35-year-old’s success in London.Simms also suggested that there was obvious room for improvement in Farah’s time of 2:06:21 – and that, if he had not had gone off so quickly in temperatures that hit 24C (75F) or had problems with his water bottles, he might have recorded a faster time.“Mo has shown he can be a very good marathon runner,” Simms said. “On Sunday he ran 61 minutes for the first half and 64 for the second. If he goes through halfway in 62 or 62:15, I would love to have seen how he came back, because the fast early pace and missing his bottles meant he lost a lot of time at the end.”Simms paid tribute to Farah, who some had thought was doing the London Marathon purely for a final payday after retiring from the track last September. “I have been with him on track races when he has not been fit and he has still been able to grind it out and win,” he said.“He has got such determination. He won’t lie down. He has been winning for a number of years. He likes winning. He does not like not winning as much as anyone as I have met, so that determination to keep winning is there. He has a pride to do\u0026nbspwell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65db3ca7215a3c6158e10f1c005195ebfeafb10d/0_79_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09af0ce865c6ff97d30fccbcc9c82cfd","title":"apple eu investigation shazam takeover data regulators music recognition","story":"EC concerned £300m deal with music-recognition app could give Apple data on users and rival streaming services to aid poachingThe EU has launched a formal investigation into Apple’s proposed acquisition of UK music-recognition app Shazam.The European commission announced its in-depth investigation into the deal over concerns that it would harm consumer choice and give Apple an unfair advantage through access to user data, which could aid in poaching customers from rivals.Shazam has been downloaded 1bn times and is used 20m times a day. It is the world’s leading music recognition system, able to listen to and identify tracks via a smartphone and then link those tracks to multiple music subscription services, which means it could therefore hold commercially sensitive data on Apple’s competitors and their consumers.Noting that Apple Music has become the second-largest music streaming service in Europe, the EC said: “Access to such data could allow Apple to directly target its competitors’ customers and encourage them to switch to Apple Music. As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage.”The EC will also investigate whether it would have a material affect on competitors, if Apple were to discontinue referral from Shazam to the likes of Spotify and Dezer.A deal between Apple and Shazam, reportedly worth £300m, was confirmed in December as a move to help the iPhone-maker better compete with market-leader Spotify. The EC launched a preliminary review of the takeover in February following a request from seven European countries including France, Italy, Spain and Sweden. Regulators will now have until 4 September to decide whether to permit the takeover.Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: “The way people listen to music has changed significantly in recent years, with more and more Europeans using music streaming services.“Our investigation aims to ensure that music fans will continue to enjoy attractive music streaming offers and won’t face less choice as a result of this proposed merger.”Apple is locked in a battle on multiple fronts within the music streaming business. It was late to the game, allowing Swedish rival Spotify to build a commanding position. Spotify has 71 million paying subscribers and a popular free, ad-supported tier. Apple Music had 38 million paying subscribers in March and the Shazam deal would also boost Apple’s ability to compete with Google’s voice-assistant services. Google Assistant already has a music-recognition system baked in, where Apple’s Siri does not, which has led to it being perceived by users as a distant third in capability behind Google’s offering and Amazon’s Alexa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d492c16f8acdabc4ea23a001ae1471037ebe72c/3_0_4547_2731/master/4547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20afb3688c937d9789595c808372501e","title":"huawei p20 pro review three camera iphone top end smartphone","story":"The Chinese smartphone maker has hit a home run with this top-end smartphone that’s on a par with the best With the P20 Pro, Huawei has not only proven that it can compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung, but it can beat them in many ways. Three cameras really are better than one (or two).Having established its name in value smartphones, Huawei has recently made inroads into the premium market with the likes of the Mate 10 Pro and last year’s P10. They were of high quality, and had all the features you’d expect from an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S. But until now they’ve not quite captured the same luxurious feel. The P20 Pro has a 6.1in full HD+ OLED screen, bigger than even the Mate 10 Pro, but squeezed into a compact body with tiny bezels rivalling Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s Galaxy S9+. It also has a notch in the top – a cutout in the screen that contains a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, the earpiece speaker and various sensors. The screen is bright and colourful, although not quite as pixel dense as rivals, and text is not quite as pin-sharp when viewed side-by-side. It’s a beautiful display that is close, but not quite as good as the best from Samsung or Apple.Unlike rivals, Huawei has kept its best-in-class fingerprint scanner on the front, squeezed into an oval shape at the bottom of the screen. The back is glass with curved edges that blend neatly into the rounded and polished metal band around the sides. The camera modules stick out the back similar to an iPhone X, which means it doesn’t sit flush on a desk.At 7.8mm thick and 180g in weight, the P20 Pro feels thin with an luxurious quality to it. It’s 0.7mm thinner and 9g lighter than Samsung’s Galaxy S9+, but 0.1mm thicker and 6g heavier than Apple’s iPhone X. All of which is to say the Huawei matches up well.The P20 Pro is also water resistant to IP67 standards, meaning up to 1m of water for up to 30 minutes – good enough to survive a trip down the toilet or into the bath.The P20 Pro has the same processor and memory configuration as the Mate 10 Pro – Huawei’s own Kirin 970 octo-core processor and its neural network processing unit – and as such is as fast and powerful as the earlier handset, keeping pace with its rivals.The P20 Pro lasts significantly longer than both Apple and Samsung’s best between charges, although not quite as long as the 50-hours the Mate 10 Pro lasts. The P20 Pro consistently lasted over 39 hours on a single charge without having to activate any power saving modes. That was with two sims in it, using the smartphone as a primary device, browsing and using apps for five hours a day with hundreds of push emails and messages, 60 minutes of Netflix, the odd spot of navigation in Google maps, shooting around 30 photos and listening to around four hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.There’s no wireless charging, but the P20 Pro charges pretty fast using the supplied power adapter and USB-C cable, despite having a comparatively large battery.The P20 Pro runs Huawei’s modified version of Android called EMUI 8.1, based on Android Oreo 8.1, making it right up to date on launch.It behaves very similarly to EMUI 8 running on the Mate 10 Pro – there is a Google Feed on the home screen and it offers the option to have an app drawer or force every app to have an icon on the home screen a la Apple’s iOS.Various power-saving features are built in, including a system to keep rogue apps from destroying your battery life. Huawei’s ultra power-saving mode can significantly extend the battery life by disabling functions and limiting the number of apps you can use, if you really need your smartphone to last four days.EMUI handles the notch in the screen very well, acting more like a screen with two ears at the top than one with a disruptive cutout. Notifications and other icons easily fit either side of the notch in the status bar, which by default is either transparent or colour-matched to the content on screen. There’s also an option to make it black all the time, effectively hiding the notch entirely.The big difference between the approach Huawei has used v that of Apple for the iPhone X is that when content or apps are displayed on the screen the area either side of the notch is blocked off so that it doesn’t intrude into what’s on-screen.Some will simply hate the idea of the notch, but being narrow and using the space either side of it as the status bar is actually a good compromise.The P20 Pro is the first smartphone to have not one, not two, but three cameras on the back, all working in conjunction to provide a multi-layered camera experience.The primary camera is a large, 40-megapixel colour camera with an f1.8 lens, which is joined by a 20-megapixel monochrome camera with an f1.6 lens and an eight megapixel telephoto camera with an f2.4 lens.The system automatically uses a combination of the cameras on the back to produce each shot. The monochrome camera adds extra light, detail and depth information, while the telephoto camera increases the zoom magnification.The combination produces excellent detail, low noise and accurate colour capture. In good light it shoots images that are stunning. In low light the P20 Pro excels too, routinely producing better images than rivals.But it is the hybrid zoom that really makes the P20 Pro really stand out. Many dual-camera smartphones offer up to a 2x zoom, which often proves rather modest. The Huawei offers up to 5x hybrid zoom, with steps all the way up and a button to switch between 1x, 3x and 5x zoom. Images shot at 3x and 5x zoom are very good, even in low light. There are plenty of modes to play with, including portrait and aperture modes, a monochrome mode that uses the dedicated camera, and an excellent long exposure night mode, which works very well even when handheld.The P20 Pro also captures very good video, including up to 960fps slow motion, and has a “Pro” mode with plenty of settings to keep most photographers happy, including RAW capture.By default the camera shoots 10-megapixel images, but there’s an option to shoot at the full 40-megapixel size, which can be fun.Huawei’s built-in camera AI performs real-time object recognition to detect the subject and switch to the appropriate mode or scene. In most circumstances it does an admirable job, but occasionally it would get caught between scenes, such as “greenery” and “flower” when trying to shoot a bunch of roses. I also found some of the modes to artificially skew the colours in the image a bit too much for my liking, making them look like photos tweaked for Instagram. I turned it off for some shoots and got better results.The front-facing selfie camera is also very good, producing well detailed and lit shots, complete with your choice of beautification effects, such as the face-shaping “perfect selfie” mode.The Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB of storage and is available in three colours.For comparison, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro with 128GB costs £699, the 6.3in Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with 64GB of storage costs £869, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB of storage, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL with 64GB costs £799, the 6in OnePlus 5T with 64GB costs £449, the 6in Honor 10 View with 128GB costs £450, and the 5.8in iPhone X with 64GB costs £999.With the P20 Pro Huawei has finally produced something that I would recommend over competitors regardless of the price. While not cheap, costing £800, in some ways you get a better experience than rivals costing £200 more.But the P20 Pro isn’t a value proposition it is a no-holds-barred attempt to usurp the current kings of the top-end smartphone, Samsung and Apple. The Mate 10 Pro was great, but Huawei has hit a home run with the P20 Pro.It’s a fantastic-looking phone that feels better than rivals in the hand, lasts significantly longer between charges and has a one of the best cameras available, offering useful features that others can’t match.There’s no wireless charging, no headphone socket, EMUI has its quirks and Huawei’s record of keeping up with software and security updates is a bit patchy. But it’s truly great to see a company that isn’t Apple or Samsung pushing boundaries once more.Cons: no headphone socket, no microSD card slot, no wireless charging, screen not the highest resolution, no Bluetooth 5 support"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca67e227474e42d9e1df00232e1a2fd951a4e8f/0_192_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318053ba82161c980e11c22d81a916ee","title":"angling for calm why i love wild fishing annalisa barbieri","story":"The opportunity to be in the moment and still in nature hooked Annalisa Barbieri on fishing – never more so than in the wildernesses of Dartmoor and the Highlands of ScotlandI am not a natural stander-stiller. In life, when not hiding behind the page, I fidget and think hurried, jumbled thoughts.Few things still me and keep me in the moment. Fishing, when I discovered it 20 years ago, was one. Not in the beginning, of course. There was too much to remember and master: knots, kit, casting. But then, when it all came together and I was able to select my fly, tie, snip and cast, my world both reduced and grew.I was fortunate to start fishing before smartphones, so there was never any temptation to video or photograph, and this habit (largely) stuck. But I found this lack only sharpens eidetic memory: some moments are too ephemeral for clicking – they force you to be present.You can, of course, fish commercial lakes and the manicured banks of chalk-streams: kempt and never more than 10 minutes from a car park. But it is really wild fishing, when there is a risk of being lost and never found again, where you feel nature has really welcomed you and folded you within her arms.Fly fishing (the sort of fishing I do) often forces you to be still, for you must first observe the water and study the insect hatches. I have often sat like this for ages: hypnotised and zoned out. Fishing legitimises outside sitting. And when you are very still, for a very long time, the wildlife accepts you. This is how I’ve seen kingfishers flash downstream and then resettle. I’ve seen osprey, harriers, kestrels, kites, buzzards, barn owls – and that’s before we go to the water’s edge. Fishing is about so much more than fish. I’ve waded into a river and just let it wash past me, not casting, just standing and watching as the wildlife plops and plinks around me. When else could you do this without someone trying to rescue you?Perhaps the wildest place I ever fished was the West Dart on Dartmoor (£15-£20 a day). A heart-busting one-hour north from Two Bridges, past medieval Wistman’s Wood with its lichen splattered trees and past Beardown (the last place on Dartmoor where bears were seen) up as far as the west Dart goes. You are miles, and hours, from anywhere, pitched against a terrain that hasn’t changed in centuries and has challenged bigger boots than yours.The brown trout here are wild, small, wily and easy to spook. So you fish with an overly long rod for such a small piece of water: a 10-footer with a 3lb breaking strain line and a fly the size of an eyelash. This is not a place to keep still whilst fishing because the water is fast. The fish, if they take your fly, let it go in a moment. Hesitate and you have lost. And then you move on, but moving on involves ninja climbs. There is no easily negotiable river bank. You climb boulders, avoiding catching your leg in the spaces between them this is not a place to break or twist a bone because you are hours from help. Then there are the quagmires to disappear into. Here you are not so much observing nature, as running with her, hoping she doesn’t turn against you.Salmon fishing in Scotland is a different beast. The rivers are big enough to swallow whole trees and send them crashing to the lowlands. The river Carron up in the Highlands is my favourite (from £50 a day). Entirely overshadowed by fancier cousins down south (the Tay, Tweed or Spey), I love her because she is lesser known, less accessible, and entirely the better for it. It was here, fishing for two days, that I was so overcome with the beauty of watching osprey fly overhead that I lay, quite still, for hours, my rod beside me, and watched the river flow past me. Mesmerising, head-clearing. It is very difficult for real life to reach you in such a place, so you feel cocooned.Then, later, we went up river to scenery so beautiful, my vocabulary shrank to just three words: Oh my God. The river crashed over waterfalls and the salmon leapt up the ladder in perfect synchronicity as they made their way back up to the redds. Sometimes the best day’s fishing is actually one that results in letting the fish do what they do best: swim free and wild."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8a305a9254194e4945e5887d44699f57222a401/0_82_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df8966a239575d179e8f6c4c4308787","title":"veteran receives unusual penis transplant","story":" A veteran who lost his genitals in a blast in Afghanistan has received the world’s most extensive penis transplant, and doctors said Monday he is recovering well and expected to leave the hospital this week.Saying they wanted to address “an unspoken injury of war”, Johns Hopkins University surgeons rebuilt the man’s entire pelvic region, transplanting a penis, scrotum and part of the abdominal wall from a deceased donor in a highly experimental 14-hour operation last month.Such transplants “can help those warriors with missing genitalia just as hand and arm transplant transformed the lives of amputees”, Dr WP Andrew Lee, Hopkins’ chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery, told reporters Monday.The patient, who asked to remain anonymous, is expected to recover urinary and, eventually, sexual function.The scrotum transplant did not include the donor’s testicles, meaning reproduction won’t be possible. “We just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions” with that extra step, said Hopkins’ Dr Damon Cooney.Three other successful penis transplants have been reported, two in South Africa and one in 2016 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Those transplants involved only the penis, not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex.The loss of a penis, whether from cancer, accident or war injury, is emotionally traumatic, affecting urination, sexual intimacy and the ability to conceive a child. Many patients suffer in silence because of the stigma their injuries sometimes carry.Doctors sometimes reconstruct the form of a penis from a patient’s own skin, usually to treat congenital abnormalities or during transgender surgery. That requires using implants to achieve erection.For a functional penis transplant, surgeons must connect tiny nerves and blood vessels. Candidates face some serious risks, including rejection of the tissue and side effects from anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life.But penis transplants have generated intense interest among veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, and a few years ago Hopkins surgeons began planning and rehearsing how to perform such a complex operation in patients with widespread tissue damage. The department of defense trauma registry has recorded 1,367 male service members who survived with genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013. It’s not clear how many victims lost all or part of the penis.Hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant. Finding donors is an additional hurdle. In the US, people or their families who agree to donate organs such as the heart or lung must be asked separately about also donating a penis, hand, face or other body part.The Hopkins patient received an extra experimental step, an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient’s immune system better tolerate a transplant. Surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several.In a statement from Hopkins, the patient was quoted as saying: “When I first woke up, I felt finally more normal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90afdac0e631f57175ca18791bce102a2087e2c/0_26_1179_707/master/1179.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cc1b799ba32d45302e89c923fec2bf2","title":"azerbaijan ruling families linked to secret investments via maltese bank","story":"President’s children among alleged beneficiaries of multimillion-pound global investments by networks of companiesAzerbaijan’s ruling families are the alleged beneficiaries of dozens of anonymously owned companies that have been used to invest in property, hotels and businesses in Europe, according to an investigation by the Daphne Project.Over the past three years, several networks of companies appear to have used a private bank in Malta for secret investments in the UK, Spain, France, Georgia and Montenegro, research by the project found. Many of the companies were allegedly operated for the benefit of the children of Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s president, and the sons of his minister for emergency situations, Kamaladdin Heydarov, according to three sources with knowledge of the transactions.Their claims are supported by information in the public domain, and a leak from Dubai residency records.Aliyev’s daughters, Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva, did not respond to a request for comment.Lawyers for Heydarov’s sons, Nijat and Tale, said: “Our clients are the beneficial owners of companies … which have entirely legitimate and lawful business.”Although there is no suggestion of wrongdoing, the disclosures are likely to raise new questions for Azerbaijan’s ruling elites, who have been widely criticised for a lack of transparency since Aliyev took power in 2003.He has been accused of presiding over a regime that has imprisoned journalists, committed human rights abuses and allowed looting of state assets by public officials. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has repeatedly called for the country to be more open and provide greater transparency as part of necessary anti-corruption measures.The president has denounced any criticism of his government as a “smear” and accused western media of waging a “biased, groundless and provocative” campaign against Azerbaijan’s leaders.The investigation shows the breadth of previously unreported investments owned by some of the elite, and how Malta has been used as a gateway for them to buy and manage assets across Europe and the rest of the world.At the heart of the network are companies that were clients of Pilatus bank, whose headquarters are in Malta and assets are frozen pending the outcome of an investigation initiated by the country’s banking regulator last month.The information appears to show for the first time that the president’s daughters own a half share in Gilan Holding, one of Azerbaijan’s largest businesses, with interests in banking, construction, tourism, agriculture and Gabala football club.Gilan Holding was founded by Heydarov in the 1980s and became one of Azerbaijan’s most successful companies before being handed to his sons, before Heydarov entered government.Assets allegedly held by the families through companies that were customers of Pilatus bank include:The Maltese regulator has declined to comment on the focus of its inquiry at Pilatus, and there is no suggestion those named in this article acted illegally. A collaboration of 18 news organisations, including the , Reuters and the New York Times, has been researching Pilatus. Led by France’s Forbidden Stories, the Daphne Project was created to continue the investigations of Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed by a car bomb in October.A fearless anti-corruption journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia’s reporting came to international attention with her exposes in the 2016 Panama Papers project.On 16 October the following year, the Maltese reporter was murdered by a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of her car.The Daphne Project was created to continue her investigations. It is a collaboration of 18 media organisations in 15 different countries, including the , Reuters, Le Monde and the New York Times.The project is the first to be led by\u0026nbspForbidden Stories, an international network of journalists who stand ready to take over when colleagues are silenced through imprisonment or murder.The project will publish a series of fresh revelations, setting out the dangers that alleged political corruption and poor controls on money laundering inside Malta pose to law and order in Europe.Fifty companies and trusts, almost all of which are owned anonymously, have been traced. They appear to belong to at least five separate groupings of companies, whose key entities were incorporated in Malta from the summer of 2014 onwards.Pilatus, the bank for many of the companies, opened its headquarters in the European Union’s smallest member state in January 2014.Azeri-controlled accounts at Pilatus are frozen, along with those of all other customers. The measures followed the arrest of the bank’s Iranian owner in Washington in March. Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad is in custody awaiting prosecution for alleged money laundering and sanctions violations in relation to his business affairs before arriving in Malta.The Pilatus scandal surfaced last year when an employee blew the whistle on the bank. Her claims, first reported by Caruana Galizia and later repeated to a European parliament inquiry, were that the customers of Pilatus included Leyla Aliyeva and Maltese politicians. The claims surfaced at a time when Azerbaijan was completing a major investment in the Maltese energy sector through a share in a power station.Two sources with knowledge of Pilatus transactions have confirmed her testimony: they say the Aliyev and Heydarov families were clients. Keith Schembri, the chief of staff of Malta’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has also confirmed he was a client.In response to a letter from the , lawyers for the Heydarov sons stated: “Our clients are the beneficial owners of companies which hold accounts at Pilatus bank in Malta, which have entirely legitimate and lawful business.” They say the structure was set up to hold European property and assets, and their ownership in many cases was in the public domain. “Where it is not, there are legitimate public-interest reasons to keep the fact of ownership private, for example where the companies hold property used by our clients for residential purposes, that ownership may be kept private for security reasons,” the lawyers said.Robert Baker, an Australian who lives in Britain, appears as a director of multiple entities with Pilatus accounts. Public filings list his address as a £2m house in west London.The largest grouping of companies, owned by the Heydarov brothers via anonymous New Zealand holding companies set up as recently as November, has invested tens of millions of pounds in European assets.These include a €3.9m (£3.4m) villa in Marbella and the $2.5m purchase of a former sanatorium in Georgia, which reports say is to be developed into a 100-room hotel at a cost of $40m.The brothers own three French artisanal businesses: a maker of china plates in Limoges for high-end restaurants, another producing cartoon character figurines, and a supplier of bed linen to the Élysée Palace. The linen company, D Porthault, hosted a visit by Brigitte Macron, the wife of the French president, last autumn.Despite repeated requests for information, the  understands that managers of these businesses, all acquired in 2014 and 2015, were never told who their ultimate owner was. The manager of the Limoges factory told the newspaper Le Monde, a partner in the Daphne Project: “It’s incredible, it’s been three years now that my questions have gone unanswered.”Two London townhouses worth a combined £16m belong to a New Zealand company called Kubernao Trust Limited, which has a Pilatus account. Baker is a former shareholder, according to public company records, and is still listed as a director. It is not known who ultimately owns the properties because their identity is hidden behind a New Zealand nominee.Lawyers for Baker said their client was “appalled” by the murder of Caruana Galizia and he had “at all times acted with the utmost good faith and integrity, and where appropriate, sought the assistance of the appropriate experts”.They declined to comment on the ownership of the companies of which Baker was a director, saying: “Confidentiality, privacy and discretion are the fundamental requirements for service providers in the consultation, management and administration of family funds and private banking.”One of the biggest revelations is that the Aliyev daughters may have a majority stake in Gilan. The Heydarov family have always presented the conglomerate as theirs. However, two sources with knowledge of Pilatus transactions have now confirmed that the owners of Sahra FZCO were declared to Pilatus as Leyla and Arzu Aliyeva.Asked about the ownership, lawyers for the Heydarov brothers said their clients would not comment “for confidentiality and security reasons”. Property records, obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, show Sahra holds two plots on Dubai’s Palm Jumeirah island.The plots are occupied by the 360-room Sofitel Dubai resort. While the family is understood to own the building, the hotel is managed by Accor. It appears that Accor, a top 40 company on the Paris bourse, is a partner with Aliyev interests in a total of three hotels. Sahra appears to have been connected through a franchise arrangement with another Accor hotel in Dubai, the Mercure Barsha Heights. And the French group operates the Fairmont in Baku, previously reported as being linked to the Aliyevs.Accor said it could not ulge details of commercial relationships.• This article was amended on 24 April 2018 to clarify that Robert Baker is not a director of any Pilatus entities.Additional reporting by Miranda Patrucic, Khadija Ismayilova, Jean-Baptiste Chastand and Anne Michel"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1610b2d3261a646b1cd5a2ae1b070109f026a9a/0_0_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859aa070365e05059f39ad0977a7d320","title":"finland to end basic income trial after two years","story":"Government rejects request for funds to expand scheme and plans stricter benefits rulesEurope’s first national government-backed experiment in giving citizens free cash will end next year after Finland decided not to extend its widely publicised basic income trial and to explore alternative welfare schemes instead.Since January 2017, a random sample of 2,000 unemployed people aged 25 to 58 have been paid a monthly €560 (£475) , with no requirement to seek or accept employment. Any recipients who took a job continued to receive the same amount.The government has turned down a request for extra funding from Kela, the Finnish social security agency, to expand the two-year pilot to a group of employees this year, and said payments to current participants will end next January.It has also introduced legislation making some benefits for unemployed people contingent on taking training or working at least 18 hours in three months. “The government is making changes taking the system away from basic income,” Kela’s Miska Simanainen told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. The scheme – aimed primarily at seeing whether a guaranteed income might incentivise people to take up paid work by smoothing out gaps in the welfare system – is strictly speaking not a universal basic income (UBI) trial, because the payments are made to a restricted group and are not enough to live on.But it was hoped it would shed light on policy issues such as whether an unconditional payment might reduce anxiety among recipients and allow the government to simplify a complex social security system that is struggling to cope with a fast-moving and insecure labour market.Olli Kangas, an expert involved in the trial, told the Finnish public broadcaster YLE: “Two years is too short a period to be able to draw extensive conclusions from such a big experiment. We should have had extra time and more money to achieve reliable results.”The idea of UBI – appealing both to the left, which hopes it can cut poverty and inequality, and to the right, which sees it as a possible route to a leaner, less bureaucratic welfare system – has gained traction recently amid predictions that automation could threaten up to a third of current jobs.The Finnish finance minister, Petteri Orpo, told Hufvudstadsbladet he was looking into trialling alternative welfare schemes, including a universal credit system similar to that being introduced in the UK, when the basic income pilot ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9692d2e5de9693165c1034c05ba532e083df92/0_618_4104_2461/master/4104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2492a07caf2abdbca4fb61f896f36415","title":"berlin museum offers glimpse of leni riefenstahl estate","story":"Critics fear bequest will fuel new wave of fanaticism among those who continue to revere the German propagandist and neo-Nazi iconDonning white gloves, Ludger Derenthal removes a green floral cardboard box from a packing case, and carefully takes out the photographs inside.He lays an array of sepia portraits of the propagandist Leni Riefenstahl across the table of the workshop of the Museum of Photography in Berlin. “In these cases are items that no one outside of Riefenstahl’s intimate circle have ever seen before,” he says.Derenthal, the museum’s director, will soon be in possession of all 700 cases containing the estate of Hitler’s favourite film-maker and neo-Nazi icon. It includes photographs, films, letters, documents, even her ing suit and gowns, as well as boxes of film rolls dating back to the 1920s.Just a stone’s throw from the museum is the Ufa Palast cinema, where premieres of her Nazi movies Triumph of the Will and Olympia took place with great fanfare in the 1930s. Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels marvelled at her talent for bringing their fascistic politics on to the screen for the masses to enjoy, under the guise of art.Riefenstahl died in 2003 at the age of 101. But her estate remained in her house on the banks of Lake Starnberg in Pöcking, Bavaria, until the death of her husband in 2016, leaving her secretary, Gisela Jahn, as the sole heir. Jahn said Riefenstahl had always wanted the estate to return to Berlin, where she was born and which was witness to many of the highlights of her controversial career.A team of German-speaking archival specialists and Riefenstahl experts will spend the next few years in a collaboration between the photography museum, the film archive and the national library, to try to piece together the life of Riefenstahl, who attempted right up until her death to promote the image of herself as a political naif who had more or less been caught up by accident in the Nazi machine.Among the controversies involving Riefenstahl the estate may throw light on is her feature film Tiefland, for which 122 Sinti and Roma extras were personally selected by Riefenstahl from two holding camps. After filming they were transported to Auschwitz, where most were murdered.Nina Gladitz, who has just completed a book on Riefenstahl, said she was sceptical that anything of historical substance would emerge from the estate due to the amount of evidence Riefenstahl herself destroyed after 1945, including close-ups from the film where the murdered Sinti might have been identifiable, so that she could not be held culpable for their deaths.“This episode has been completely ignored by academics and film historians,” said Gladitz. “I have no expectation of anything coming out of this research that would throw light on her crimes because Riefenstahl did her utmost in her lifetime to keep her myth intact.”Among the advisers to the project is Rainer Rother, the artistic director of the German film archive and a Riefenstahl biographer. He said there was little more to be learnt about Riefenstahl’s role in the Nazi era. “I’m not expecting any unsettling findings to be made – the situation of Riefenstahl between 33 and 45 has been brilliantly researched already – but I am expecting that the picture we have of Leni Riefenstahl and how she created her films and photos to become much clearer,” he said. Concerns have been voiced that the estate will prompt a new wave in Riefenstahl fanatics, many of whom continue to celebrate the last surviving prominent member of the Third Reich as an artist of great stature, often ignoring the political context.Others have expressed unease that Riefenstahl’s photographs will be stored in the same museum where Helmut Newton’s work has been on display since 2004. The Jewish photographer was forced to flee Nazi Germany as a boy in 1938, and is buried in Berlin.Brian Winston, professor of film at Lincoln University, said he was appalled at the decision to bring Riefenstahl’s works together with Newton’s. “It’s an absurd and disgusting obscenity that the estate of Hitler’s favourite film-maker is to be given a home in the foundation of a man who was forced to flee Nazi Germany because he was a Jew.“Those who see anything to admire in Riefenstahl’s work, which was mired in fascistic content and sensibility, have been duped again just as she, and those who supported her, wanted.”Derenthal said the museum was reassured by Jahn’s assertions that the two were friends, Newton having visited Riefenstahl in Pöcking, and points to the correspondence that passed between them.As a climax of the preview, Derenthal produces a folder of letters, labelled “Special Correspondence H-Z”. As those present squeeze together to get a closer look he says: “I’m afraid to disappoint you, but there is no letter from Adolf Hitler here.” Instead there are notes to Riefenstahl from Siegfried and Roy, the legendary entertainment duo, the actor Sharon Stone and Newton, who wrote: “Dear Leni, you look bewitchingly glamorous and those legs ... poor Marlene (Dietrich – the German film star) would be green with envy.”Some have cited the letter as proof of a close relationship between Newton and Riefenstahl, others as the photographer’s successful attempt to flatter her into sitting for him for Vanity Fair at the age of 100. The result, showing a hollow-eyed Riefenstahl, powdering her face, was deemed to be deeply unflattering and a critique of her Third Reich role. “So much for them being friends. This was Newton’s final revenge on the Nazi grand dame,” says Gladitz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e2ed59374d36b16dfff26535a3d480045e30299/0_99_3904_2343/master/3904.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d44415110576bd139915a7cd95b11e5","title":"student says peking university trying to silence her over claim petition","story":"Young activist publishes letter alleging harassment over role in movement calling for more accountability over campus sex assaultsA student activist calling for transparency over an alleged rape at China’s top university has accused the university of trying to silence her.Earlier this month, former classmates of a literature student at Peking University (PKU) who killed herself in 1998 came forward to say she had been raped by her professor, Shen Yang, who denies the allegation. PKU and two other universities subsequently cut ties with Shen and a group of current PKU students petitioned the school to hand over all documents related to the case. The case is at the centre of a small but growing #MeToo movement among students at PKU and other universities across China who have been calling for more accountability over sexual assault on campuses. The movement is unusual in an environment where any activism, especially among students, is closely monitored and stamped out.One of the students who signed the petition, Yue Xin, a senior at the university’s school of foreign languages, published a letter on Monday alleging harassment and intimidation. Yue said she has been called in for several meetings with school officials, often lasting until late into the night. She accused administrators of suggesting she might not be able to graduate and asking what her mother and grandmother would think of her behaviour.Yue claims that at about 1am on Monday, her adviser, accompanied by Yue’s mother, stormed into her dorm room, waking her and forcing her to delete all documents from her computer related to the petition. Afterwards Yue’s parents drove her home. She has not been able to return to school, Yue said in the letter, according to a translation by China Digital Times.Student activism at Peking University has a long history, dating back to 1919 when thousands of students protested against a treaty granting Chinese territory to Japan, the 4 May  movement. In 1989, student activists converged again in Beijing on Tiananmen Square to call for reforms in demonstrations that were put down by force.Online searches for Yue’s name have been blocked and her post has been deleted, but not before users recorded it using blockchain technology. Others have circulated a screenshot of her letter upside down to avoid censors on the WeChat.A photo of a poster on a university bulletin board, a gesture reminiscent of banners and leaflets posted on the the school’s former “democracy wall”, used during the 1989 protests, circulated on social media. PKU’s school of foreign languages said on its website on Monday that Yue’s mother had been summoned out of concern because Yue could not be reached. “We always honour every student’s fundamental rights and make great effort to protect each and every student’s lawful rights”, the school said.According to Yue, the school responded to the petition by saying there were no minutes of the meeting where Shen’s behaviour was discussed. Because of an error, the relevant department did not have Shen’s statement on the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f440b9859fc5952ab049483365093fa759472a5d/0_0_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a743b9be47058eafd0ca481dcc3afc07","title":"swiss rosti with a twist north and south korea summit menus diplomacy","story":"Dinner references Kim Jong-un’s childhood in Switzerland and a special request from Moon Jae-inKim Jong-un will be served Swiss rösti with a Korean twist at a summit on Friday with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, the South’s presidential Blue House said on Tuesday.

Baked John Dory, a dish made from the flat sea fish, will also be served in recognition of Moon’s younger days in the South Korean port city of Busan.North Korea has never confirmed Kim was educated in Switzerland, but former classmates and teachers have described their time with him in the country.

Okryu Gwan is North Korea’s best-known restaurant famous for the dish, and has branches in China as well.

A UN mechanism to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons use came to an end in November after Russia vetoed a resolution to extend its mandate, complaining that the mechanism was prejudiced against the Syrian government.Ian Martin, a former UN official and Amnesty International chief, said: “The Russian veto need not be the end of efforts for collective action by the UN. The responsibility of asserting accountability for the use of chemical weapons, and for bringing an end to the horrors of the Syrian conflict, rests with the world community as a whole.”The proposal is known to have support among western officials. The security council is the UN’s most powerful body, the only one with the authority to issue legally binding resolutions that can be backed up by sanctions, blue-helmeted peacekeepers or by force of arms.There are five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and 10 temporary members at any one time, elected by the general assembly for two-year terms.For a resolution to be passed, nine of the 15 council members must vote for it, but permanent members have a veto. Russia has repeatedly blocked resolutions targeting its ally, Syria. China has also vetoed resolutions on Syria.One possible remedy is to expand the security council and its permanent membership, but the existing members have mixed feelings. The UK and France say they are in favour, the US and Russia are more tepid and China is against it.Another possible remedy involves reining in the use of the veto. France and others argue an immediate fix would be for permanent members to waive their veto rights in cases of mass atrocities, but Russia is adamant in its opposition.\u0026nbspThe impasse was raised at an annual weekend closed-door retreat attended by security council ambassadors in Sweden, and is now likely to be discussed further at a series of meetings this week. Western powers fear the absence of an attribution mechanism not only gives Syria free range to continue to use chemical weapons, but also to deliver a severe blow to the international world order.The US, France and the UK launched a missile attack on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons sites 10 days ago in response to allegations that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack on the town of Douma on 7 April. Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are in Douma. But regardless of what they find, the OPCW does not have powers to attribute responsibility.Since that strike there have been renewed diplomatic efforts, largely brokered by Sweden, to agree a UN resolution on a new investigatory mechanism, but so far they have been fruitless.Western governments, worried that the impasse is weakening the wider authority of the security council, want to pick up a rarely used route, first set up in the 1950 Korean crisis. Called “uniting for peace”, it would enable nine members of the 15-strong security council to bypass a Russian veto and refer the matter to a full vote at the general assembly. It would then require a two-thirds majority by the general assembly for an attribution mechanism to be agreed.The 1950 “uniting for peace” route was explicitly designed to be used when the security council could not meet its responsibilities over maintenance of peace. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said at the weekend that the world had entered a new cold war era where the threat of instability was greater than the previous cold war.In objecting to an attribution mechanism, Russia has opposed the mix of nationalities on the OPCW and the absence of routine on-site inspections. It also insists that final decisions on attribution must be made by the security council, where it can wield its veto.The western powers have made concessions to secure a compromise UN resolution on attribution, but will not concede the principle that Russian could veto the inspection team findings.A separate proposal for Guterres to set up special panel on Syria, as has happened in the past over Sri Lanka, has been greeted with scepticism because it would be easy for Russia to dismiss such an ad hoc body set up on the sole authority of the secretary general.The western missile strikes appears to have had little impact on either side, making concessions in the Syrian peace talks.A meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Canada agreed that Russia needed to do more to contribute to a political settlement in Syria, but the UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, met Russian officials over the weekend in Moscow, and little evidence emerged that Russia was willing to force the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to negotiate with opposition groups on a future constitution.An EU humanitarian conference in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday is likely to focus on how to prepare for an expected Syrian regime attack on Idlib, in north-west Syria, one of the last remaining rebel held areas in the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc1d37f0b205ec3682f8d0c6a3f28b9b705bd64b/0_228_2990_1794/master/2990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ab332e0ac7f7a33691799b00fc3ae29","title":"emmanuel macron goes to washington in pictures","story":"The French president and his wife Brigitte opened their pomp-filled three-day state visit with a double date with Donald and Melania Trump at George Washington’s house"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471788.1524515057!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water to seek planning permission for shannon pipeline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“Over half of the water produced is used in our homes and businesses. The rest, 658m litres of water, is lost through leaking pipes every day”Irish Water has rejected the concerns of hundreds of objectors to its plan to extract water from the river Shannon and pipe it to Dublin in a €1.3 billion project set to supply 40 per cent of Ireland’s population from 2025.Taking the water from Parteen basin on the Shannon in north Tipperary is the best way to ensure a sustainable water source for both Dublin and major towns in the midlands located close to the proposed 170km pipeline, and to provide sufficient capacity to allow for population growth and economic development up to 2050, Irish Water concludes in its latest evaluation of options published on Tuesday.Having taken on board the views of more than 1,000 “stakeholders” in the final phase of a public consultation process, the utility confirmed it would now go ahead and seek planning permission for the project from An Bord Pleanála next year.It said future water needs of the eastern and the midlands regions “cannot be met by fixing leaks alone”.It has also published a detailed response to concerns raised on the route chosen, and addressed issues highlighted about the environmental impact of the project.Having updated data on water consumption projections and included latest census figures, it said it stands by its original analysis justifying the project, which has been subjected to sustained criticism from the River Shannon Protection Alliance and Fight the Pipe campaign, representing 500 landowners along the route.The “Water Supply Project – Eastern and Midlands Region” would end over-dependence on the river Liffey to serve the Dublin region, and provide an additional 330 million litres of water a day which Irish Water says will be needed by the region by 2050 when its population is projected to grow to 2.1 million.The utility highlights the current lack of sufficient “headroom” to meet peak demands on supply in certain scenarios, such as a climate change event. “Failure to provide for such events will guarantee repeated supply failure, with its severe social and economic consequences,” it warns in its latest report.In response to analysis by the financial consultant Emma Kennedy, who has advised some of the environmental groups objecting to the plan, it says future water needs of the eastern and the midland regions “cannot be met by fixing leaks alone”.It admits leakage in Dublin is “unacceptably high”, but rejects her conclusion the project would be unnecessary if Irish Water addressed its “extremely unambitious leakage-reduction targets” in the capital.Irish Water head of asset management Sean Laffey said existing raw water sources for the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) would be at capacity by 2025, and water saved from fixing leaks under its leakage-reduction programme would not be enough to meet future demand.Leakage in the Greater Dublin Area network is at 36 per cent, and there are 9,000km of water pipes, “greater than the distance between Dublin and Beijing” – many of them date back to the Victorian times, and therefore vulnerable to leaks.At present Irish Water is rolling out a comprehensive programme to address leaks which includes an initial investment of €500 million which “will save 166 million litres of water a day by 2021 – enough to supply Cork city twice over”.“However, this cannot keep pace with growth needs,” Mr Laffey said. This is before allowing for extreme weather events such as the drought that affected the midlands last summer or the multiple bursts and water shortages following Storm Emma.Irish Water produces 1.67 billion litres of water every day nationally, which is distributed through 63,000km of water main. Leakage is spread over the entire extent of this infrastructure, not just older pipes, it says.“Over half of the water produced is used in our homes and businesses. The rest, 658 million litres of water, is lost through leaking pipes every day,” the report adds.Ireland’s leakage is high compared to other EU countries due to a combination of factors, including the age and condition of pipes, poor performance of certain pipe materials, soil conditions, length of the network and “lack of investment in water infrastructure over the past 150 years”.In the Greater Dublin Water supply area (GDWSA) 207 million litres of water are lost daily. “To drive down leakage water savings must be delivered faster than the rate which new leaks occur” which adds to Dublin’s difficulties, Irish Water says. “Leakage-reduction within the GDWSA is an absolute priority. It is not a choice of either delivering leakage savings or building a new supply.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3471673.1524506487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shannon critical for reliable long term dublin water supply","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Shannon river.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Existing water supply sources “do not have the capacity or resilience to meet future requirements of homes and businesses in Dublin and the midlands”, Irish Water concludes in its latest evaluation of the proposal to extract water from the river Shannon and to pipe it to Dublin.The utility says extraction from the Shannon at Parteen, Co Tipperary, is best suited “to meet urgent water needs” of the greater Dublin and heavily-populated midland towns along the 170km pipeline route. The project is costed at €1.3 billion with a view to homes and businesses receiving the new supply by 2025.The evaluation of “final options” includes analysis of the project based on new data and includes Irish Water’s detailed response to issues raised in the latest public consultation phase on the project.It rejects all questions raised about the need for the project recent criticism of its analysis of projected water needs for Dublin, and a failure to address the capital’s leakage problem which is among the worst in the EU.The Water Supply Project – Eastern and Midlands Region (WSP) – “will deliver a secure, reliable and sustainable long-term water supply that will be critical to support the eastern and midlands region’s social and economic growth from 2025”, it adds.It will be the biggest upgrade to Ireland’s water source infrastructure in more than 60 years, ease overdependence on the Liffey, and ultimately provide an additional 330 million litres a day Irish Water says will be needed by the Dublin region by 2050 when its population is projected to grow to 2.1 million.The pipeline is intended to supply 40 per cent of Ireland’s population, which is concentrated in and around Dublin.Following extraction at Parteen and treatment nearby at Birdhill, water will be piped to a termination point reservoir at Peamount in Co Dublin before connecting into the greater Dublin network.Communities in North Tipperary, Offaly, Laois, Westmeath, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, it says, will also benefit from the project with possible future off-shoots from the pipe that will enable the development of extra homes and businesses and increase potential inward investment.Apart from the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), “the most urgent areas with impending water deficits in the region are the Mullingar supply area of Westmeath and the rapidly expanding area of east Meath bordering the GDA”, it notes.Following its publication, Irish Water head of asset management Sean Laffey said: “The recently-published National Planning Framework confirmed the urgent need for a new long-term water supply source for the eastern and midlands region by the mid-2020s, to provide for projected growth up to 2050 and to ensure that the region has a safe, secure and resilient water supply for the region.”More than 1,000 stakeholders participated in the consultation and a wide range of issues were raised by the public.“Their engagement and input has helped us develop a long-term strategic investment project that we believe is environmentally sustainable and will bring economic benefits to the whole country,” he added.Forecast population and economic growth would generate “a demand for an additional 330 million litres of water per day by 2050 to give both the GDA and the midlands regions the resilience and reliability of service that is essential to inspire public confidence and continue to attract economic opportunity”, Mr Laffey said.An infrastructural deficit was made clear when Storm Emma struck Ireland recently and the Greater Dublin Water Supply Area was found to have “operational headroom” to meet peak demand of only 1.5 per cent, which resulted in large-scale water outages and water restrictions. This alone underlined the WSP “is very, very urgent”, he said.“If we continue to operate without the required headroom, we can expect more frequent water outages… In a properly functioning water utility, the target resource headroom should never be less than 13-15 per cent for major urban centres,” the report states.Assessment of options over many years had identified “the Parteen Basin option delivers the widest benefit to the greatest number of people with the least environmental impact and in the most cost effective manner”, he said.An environmental impact assessment report and Natura impact statement are being prepared for submission with the planning application.While Irish Water’s latest WSP report marks the formal end of consultation, it says it “will continue to meet with interested stakeholders to make sure we work together to deliver the vision of a safe, secure and sustainable water source for the eastern and midlands region”.The feedback received and Irish Water’s response are available at watersupplyproject.ie"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3472514.1524566753!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ulster bank offers emergency cash as money vanishes from accounts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn some instances, customers have had their Ulster Bank credit and debit cards declined when making purchases.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Calls for extra funding for it were rejected and the two year trial will not be extended after next year.  The scheme saw 2,000 unemployed Finns, picked at random, receive a flat monthly payment of €560 (£490). The government will now look at other ideas to reform its social security system.Supporters argue that a universal basic income would provide a safety net and boost innovation, creativity and personal well-being, as well as helping the unemployed find temporary work.It would counteract the insecurity of increasing number of short term contracts offered employees and boost labour mobility by encouraging workers to take the risk of moving jobs.“The eagerness of the government is evaporating,” Olli Kangas, one of the experiment\u0027s designers told the BBC.Professor Kangas said the government had turned down a request to expand the scheme to pay up to £61 million to fund the basic income for employed Finns rather than the group of 2,000 unemployed people.Finland’s unemployment rate of 9.2 per cent, higher than its Nordic neighbours, and complex benefits system had fuelled calls for an ambitious rethink.We cannot be tempted by a Universal Basic Income - it would do huge damage to the economyA report by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce said in February that the British government should consider giving £10,000 to every British citizen under the age of 55 as part of a universal basic income fund.  Nicola Sturgeon called for research into the idea for Scotland in 2017 and the idea was part of the UK Green Party\u0027s manifesto that year.  In February, the OECD think tank said that a universal credit system replacing benefits payments with a single sum, such as that being introduced in Britain, would work better than a universal basic income.In 2016, Swiss voters rejected a plan to introduce a guaranteed basic income for all, regardless of whether or not they were employed.More than three quarters of referendum voters opposed a plan offering an unconditional monthly income of £1,755 for each adult and £458 for each child.Please review our commenting policyRoyal baby latest news: New prince to meet family as world awaits name announcementAnzac Day 2018: How the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign helped forge Australia\u0026#39s national identityKim Jong-un says he and Pompeo share ‘same kind of guts’ as details emerge of secret meetingsMadonna loses legal battle to prevent auction of Tupac letter and other personal itemsA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsToronto suspect begged police to shoot him after van ploughs into pedestrians leaving ten deadWhat do we know about Alek Minassian, arrested after Toronto van attack?Royal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedTens of thousands raised for MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died during London MarathonFirst look at Donald Trump\u0026#39s lavish state banquet for Emmanuel MacronHorses are being sold \u0026#39cheaper than kittens\u0026#39, RSPCA warns amid rise in cruelty casesWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

It began around 1.30pm Toronto time on Monday. Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, was attending a meeting of G7 ministers in the city, but the gathering was not near the site of the incident. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, said: \u0026quotWe\u0027re still gathering information and as soon as we can, we\u0027ll share more information with Canadians.\u0026quotMr Trudeau added:  \u0026quotOur thoughts are with all those affected by the terrible incident at Yonge and Finch in Toronto. Thank you to the first responders working at the scene – we\u0027re monitoring the situation closely\u0026quot.Numerous witnesses, many of whom appeared shaken by the incident, described seeing the van swerving to hit pedestrians.James Forrester saw the aftermath of the incident from the 19th floor of an office building where he works as a financial services representative with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. “Police were just arriving, people were screaming, there were bodies on the  ground, and I saw a lot of blood,” he told The .Mr Forrester described seeing three dead bodies on the pavement covered by orange sheets, about 10 ambulances, seven police cars and an estimated crowd of 30 onlookers. Police said nine people have been killed in the attack, while 16 more are injuredHe added that the white van travelled about two kilometres before it was stopped by police, and that as many as 40 people may have been hit. Henry Miller, who lives in an apartment overlooking the street, told Sky News: \u0026quotI heard a large amount of honking...and I stepped out onto the balcony to see what was causing the trouble and at this point I saw a lady lying on the floor and the van driving off with people running around trying to help her\u0026quot.The van injured around ten people in Toronto, according to reportsOne witness described seeing a middle-aged man “barely moving” on the ground after being hit. He told CNN: “I feel sick to my stomach ... I’ve never seen anything like this before.\u0026quotKash Alavi, another witness, described seeing victims with faces “full of blood”, telling CNN that the legs of those hit had been \u0026quottwisted and contorted\u0026quot. Another witness speaking to the network who did not give his name became emotional describing how the van swerved to repeatedly hit pedestrians. “He’s just hitting people one by one by one. It was a nightmare,” he said. The van “just went on the side walk and started hitting everyone”, he added. A woman stands crying in the aftermath of the incidentThe witness said seeing a pushchair “split in half” and a group of people sitting on a bench being hit by the van. He said what he had witnessed was like “a war zone”.Meaghan Gray, a Toronto police spokesman, said: \u0026quotAt this point it\u0027s too early to tell what if any motive there was\u0026quot.Kim McKinnon, Toronto paramedic spokesman, said at least eight ambulances took victims of the incident to nearby Sunnybrook hospital.Andrew Scheer, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has issued a statement, extending his condolences to those who had lost loved ones in the attack and said the inidual responsible should feel the full force of the law.“We have all seen by now the incredible footage of a police officer staring down the attacker alone on a city street.“The men and women of our police services represent the best of what it means to be Canadian, and today we thank them.“I am confident that all Canadians stand in support of the people of Toronto as they come together to support families impacted by this tragedy. The stories of bravery, selflessness, and kindness that have emerged have been an inspiration to an entire nation.”Mr Saunders is asked about sources saying police have ruled out a connection to Isil or international terrorism, but he won\u0027t be drawn. \u0026quotI\u0027m not going to answer what the media are putting forward,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotWe open lanes and we explore.\u0026quotIf there is no evidence to support a theory, he says, then it is closed - but not until then.Mark Saunders, the Toronto police chief, is taking questions from journalists. He says the suspect, Alek Minassian, was not known to police as far as he could tell so far. But he said the van had driven on the wrong side of the road and repeatedly mounted the kerb. \u0026quotIt\u0027s very clear from a general perspective that the actions looked deliberate,\u0026quot he said.He added that the suspect was not armed and that police were investigating whether he had accomplices.Speaking to the media, Ralph Goodale, Canadian Public Safety Minister, said so far there was \u0026quotno national security connection to this particular incident\u0026quot.However, officials are at pains to say the investigation is at an early stage.City officials are briefing the media now.

The official agreed to reveal that information only if not quoted by name.Ralph Goodale, Canadian Public Safety Minister, said he had no evidence to suggest Canada\u0027s national threat level needed to be raised following today’s attack in Toronto.\u0026quotThere is no information available to me at the present time that would indicate a change in the risk level,\u0026quot Mr Goodale told reporters in Toronto, where he is attending the G7 foreign and security ministers meeting.The suspect in the Toronto van attack that killed nine people and injured 16 others is a 25-year-old man named Alek Minassian, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said on Monday.He is believed to be a student at Seneca College in Toronto.He reportedly lives in Richmond Hill, north of Toronto.Phil Zullo was headed north driving along Yonge Street, Toronto’s main artery, early Monday afternoon when he saw a bus shelter down, poles bent over, shoes along the road, “and then body after body after body” for a three-block stretch.“People were mangled on the sidewalk.“At first I saw what I thought was a stroller – and said to myself ‘please don’t make me see a kid,’ but I got closer and saw it was a walker,\u0026quot said Mr Zullo, 47, who runs a fitness facility in the city and estimated that he saw between 10 and 15 bodies on the ground.“I called my wife and said, ‘I think I just saw a terrorist attack.’”He said that thousands of people live and work in the area, and that dozens of police officers and emergency responders converged on the scene “from everywhere” providing CPR to the victims.“It was as if they had done this a hundred times. These guys were unbelievable.”Mr Zullo also saw the suspect, leaning against a police cruiser, surrounded by three officers who handcuffed him.He described the man as dark-skinned, clean-shaven, bald and wearing glasses. The man reportedly pointed his cellphone at police as if it were a weapon.“This has never happened here,” said Mr Zullo. “But why not us?”Officers at the sceneUsers in the area can check in and let friends know they are safe hereCanadians at home and all around the world are doing their Canadian thing, keeping calm and not jumping to conclusions.The Toronto Maple Leafs are playing the Boston Bruins in a play-off game tonight.

Children can become severely dehydrated and die on the way to a clinic or hospital. But it’s not just about deaths. I’m a paediatrician and it’s important we do whatever we can to keep kids out of hospital,” she said.The Gates Foundation is highlighting the importance of vaccines with the launch of a video by Aardman Animations, creators of Wallace and Gromit. According to data from the World Health Organization there has been an 84 per cent fall in the number of measles deaths since the introduction of a vaccine against the disease. And so far this year there have been just eight cases of polio thanks to the global vaccination campaign.Heather Wright, executive producer at Aardman, said the campaign had a simple message: to urge parents and carers to get their child vaccinated.\u0026quotYou would throw yourself in front of a bus to protect your child so why wouldn\u0027t you get your child immunised?\u0026quot she said. According to the latest data 95 countries have introduced a vaccine against rotavirus, and 22 have plans to do so. These include many high-income countries such as the UK and the US, and low-income countries which receive financial help from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.However, around 75 countries have not introduced the vaccine: these include middle income countries such as China, Russia, Egypt and Chile which do not qualify for support from Gavi. Dr Zaidi said that countries had many competing priorities but stressed that the vaccine was not only good for a nation’s health, but also economic prospects. In many countries, where there is no system of health coverage, people face financial ruin when they or members of their family are hospitalised.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016A recent study looked at the impact of the introduction of various vaccines, including rotavirus, on 41 low and middle-income countries between 2016 and 2030. It predicted that as well as averting 819 deaths for every one million people vaccinated the rotavirus vaccine would also prevent 242,000 people from facing catastrophic health costs.Dr Zaidi said: “People don’t think of vaccines as a poverty reduction tool but they are. People in low income countries need to recognise what powerful tools vaccines are for reducing the health and financial burden of the poor.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Royal baby latest news: New prince to meet family as world awaits name announcementAnzac Day 2018: How the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign helped forge Australia\u0026#39s national identityKim Jong-un says he and Pompeo share ‘same kind of guts’ as details emerge of secret meetingsMadonna loses legal battle to prevent auction of Tupac letter and other personal itemsA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitToronto van suspect shouted \u0026#39shoot me in the head\u0026#39 at police officer who is hailed a hero for not opening fireWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsToronto suspect begged police to shoot him after van ploughs into pedestrians leaving ten deadWhat do we know about Alek Minassian, arrested after Toronto van attack?Royal family tree: How the line of succession to the British throne has changed with the new royal baby boyTSB banking problems: what to do if you\u0026#39re affectedTens of thousands raised for MasterChef contestant Matt Campbell who died during London MarathonFirst look at Donald Trump\u0026#39s lavish state banquet for Emmanuel MacronHorses are being sold \u0026#39cheaper than kittens\u0026#39, RSPCA warns amid rise in cruelty casesWhat is the \u0026#39First Past The Post\u0026#39 voting system?What is Article 50?

He added: \u0026quotIt is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them.\u0026quotIt\u0027s a boy Celebrating the Royal baby - in picturesThe name of the baby Prince of Cambridge, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz, has yet to be unveiled. Royals traditionally keep the public guessing before revealing their choice and William and Kate will want to share the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public.Kensington Palace said the name would be announced in \u0026quotdue course\u0026quot but the favourite at the bookies is currently Arthur, followed by James, Philip and Albert.Born fifth in line, the baby is the Queen and Philip\u0027s sixth great-grandchild and Kensington Palace said the couple, along with the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and the Middletons, were delighted with the news of the new arrival.Video: How news of the Royal baby\u0027s name will be announcedGeorge and Charlotte, who visited their new sibling at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, London, on Monday afternoon, are likely to be at school and nursery on Tuesday.A confident, excited Charlotte, who turns three on May 2, turned to wave at the photographers outside the hospital as she led the way up the steps holding William\u0027s hand. Four-year-old George, in his school uniform, appeared more wary of the huge crowds of media.During his first photocall, the baby, who was wrapped in a white lace shawl with a matching bonnet, could be seen moving his fingers as he was cradled by Kate.Stay with us for the latest updatesThe Prince of Wales said he and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are \u0026quotboth so pleased at the news\u0026quot.Prince Charles said in a statement: \u0026quotIt is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them.”The official commemorative souvenirs marking the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby son have gone on sale - before the new prince\u0027s name has been announced.Featuring a lion cub and unicorn inspired by the Royal Arms, the Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons, silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern.The pieces bear the words \u0026quotWelcome to our new royal baby\u0026quot and display William and Kate\u0027s coronet.The range of official commemorative chinaware to celebrate the prince\u0026#39s birth The official range includes a pillbox costing £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate priced at £49.Each item in the range is gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent using traditional methods.There is also a pram-shaped woven decoration, made with glistening threads, delicate pearl detail, and embroidered on the back with \u0026quotRoyal Baby 2018\u0026quot, for £14.95.A middle name of the Prince of Wales, Arthur is also one of Prince William\u0027s middle names as well as the Queen\u0027s father, George VI.The legendary King Arthur was the mythical leader of the knights of the Round Table, who supposedly lived in the 5th or 6th century.Once popular, the name fell out of fashion, but has had a revival in recent years. Former prime minister David Cameron has a son called Arthur.Queen Victoria used to insist that the name Albert was used as a middle name by her descendants, if not a first, in honour of her much-loved consort Prince Albert.By choosing Albert or Bertie for a boy, the Duke and Duchess would be honouring Queen Elizabeth II\u0027s father, George VI, who was actually Albert Frederick Arthur George but always known to his family as Bertie.Shy, stammering Bertie was forced to become king when his brother Edward VIII abdicated, but won the nation\u0027s affection by standing firm in London during the Second World War.A lasting tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh might see the new Prince of Cambridge called Philip.Both Prince Charles and Prince William have Philip as a middle name.The Duke of Edinburgh - known for his dedication to duty and his acerbic wit - has been married to the Queen for more than 70 years and is the nation\u0027s longest serving consort.A Prince Freddie of Cambridge would have a historical link to the 1st Duke of Cambridge.Prince Adolphus Frederick lived from 1774 to 1850 and was a son of George III.He was apparently very fond of interrupting church services by bellowing out \u0026quotBy all means\u0026quot if the priest said \u0026quotLet us pray\u0026quot.William may want to pay tribute to his father - but perhaps as a middle name as it may be considered too similar to Charlotte.James could be chosen to signify the Duchess\u0027s affection for her brother, the baby\u0027s uncle, James Middleton.William already has a cousin James, the Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s son, Viscount Severn.James is a Stuart name. James I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, had been king of Scotland for 36 years as James VI when he became king of England in 1603.They could choose William as a middle name for a boy, but also perhaps Michael as a middle name out of respect for Kate\u0027s father.Kate\u0027s grandfather on her paternal side was called Peter, while on her maternal side, her grandfather was Ronald.Thomas also appears several times in Kate\u0027s family tree, as does Francis.When it comes to godparents, the youngest Cambridge child might well be dealt the best hand yet. After seven years of marriage (and three children), the Duke and Duchess now know exactly who their real friends are.Plus, with 12 godparents between them, Prince George and Princess Charlotte have already ticked off all those their parents felt obliged to ask. Admittedly a few of their oldest and best friends have already been bagged – Emilia d’Erlanger, for example, is George’s godmother and Prince William’s friend, Tom Van Straubenzee belongs to Chalotte – but there are plenty more of their friends waiting in the wings, as well as a few close cousins. Click here for our best guestimate at who might be in the frame for possible godparents to the new prince.Some of the runners and riders in our shortlist in the race to become the youngest royal\u0026#39s godparents It would be a worst nightmare for most new mothers, but the Duchess of Cambridge had a close knit team of helpers on hand to help ensure she looked her best for her moment in front of the world\u0027s media.For the past few years, the Duchess has worked closely with former PA Natasha Archer and hairdresser Amanda Cook Tucker to ensure that her every public appearance is pristine.Natasha Archer and Amanda Cook Tucker arriving to tend to Kate after the birth of Prince GeorgeThe duo are often spotted loading vanity cases and suit carriers onto the royal jet during tours or lurking behind the scenes to tend to the Duchess whenever she needs.Here is everything you need to know about the Royal \u0026quotglam squad\u0026quot, who were on hand for the Duchess\u0027s Lindo Wing exit.Arthur remains the bookmakers\u0027 favourite for the new Royal baby\u0027s name, but James is the most popular for inidual wagers placed with Ladbrokes.James  has seen the largest amount of bets and money placed since the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth.It is the same name as the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s brother, James Middleton.

And if it does then recent price falls will appear trivial.”Other recent price predictions include Pantera Capital’s prediction that it will reach $20,000 by the end of the year, and Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee’s forecast that bitcoin will rise as high as $25,000 in 2018.One of the most ambitious predictions comes from renowned investor Tim Draper, who announced earlier this month that a single bitcoin could be worth more than a quarter of a million dollars within the next four years.“I’m thinking $250,000 a bitcoin by 2022,” Mr Draper told a crowd in California. “Believe it, it’s going to happen. They’re going to think you’re crazy but believe it, it’s happening, it’s going to be awesome.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Research by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS) showed O2 was the best performing network, with Vodafone ranked as the worst based on testing using both Android and iOS devices in 32 cities and towns across the UK. Telefonica-owned O2 was rated the most reliable network in 17 places, while Three was most reliable in 12 – including London – and EE came out on top in three.Meanwhile, when it comes to criteria for selecting a network consumers are twice as likely to choose reliability over network speed, according to surveys and focus groups conducted by YouGov on behalf of GWS.  When asked to consider the five most important criteria in selecting an operator more than two thirds (69 per cent) of respondents selected making calls, while 53 per cent selected texting, followed by 43 per cent who chose internet browsing. Just 3 per cent of consumers listed watching videos as a key function. “There is too much focus on ranking operators by data speed versus other key network performance aspects such as reliability and customer satisfaction. The message we received loud and clear is that consumers want to know which network they can rely on to keep them connected to friends and family or to provide access to content,” said GWS chief executive Paul Carter.  “Our testing showed that all operators currently provide mobile internet quick enough to stream a video from Netflix, but the real issue is which network will let you call, text and browse the internet most reliably.”According to GWS’s research, the most common problems reported by phone users were apps failing to load, text messages not sending, and calls either not connecting or dropping mid-conversation. The survey also found that more than 500,000 18 to 34-year-olds admit to throwing their phone down in anger when they lose signal.“Consumers have told us that the persistent issue of mobile signal not-spots around the country is clearly infuriating them. Our testing shows that local authorities in big cities like London and Birmingham need to work more closely with network operators to ensure network coverage is not being held back by red tape,” said Mr Carter.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Last month, two 18-year-old males were arrested after a Nottingham Trent University student posted video footage of racist chants in her student halls. A black student captured two males chanting “We hate the blacks” outside her bedroom door.Members of a student law society at the University of Exeter were suspended after private WhatsApp conversations containing racist comments were shared on social media.And earlier this month, Sheffield Hallam University launched an investigation after a rotten banana was reportedly thrown at a black graduate student during an ice hockey match.On the latest figures, Mr Lammy, the former Labour higher education minister, said: “Questions clearly have to be asked about what is behind this disproportionality within the Ucas verification system, and why applications made by black students are more likely to be flagged and investigated.“The evidence suggests that unconscious bias may well be a factor.”Angela Rayner, shadow education secretary, said: “This shocking practice highlights just how pervasive institutional racism is across the higher education sector. Ucas has been completely unable to justify this discriminatory practice. “Ucas must urgently investigate this and make clear what steps will be taken to end the racial profiling of students.”Fraud and similarity detection software, as well as input from universities, are used when deciding whether an application needs investigating. The process looks out for a variety of things – including fake qualifications, plagiarised personal statements and inaccurate information.Since the findings have come to light Ucas has said it will publish data, showing the gender and race of applicants flagged, to the public annually – with the first figures expected next month.The total number of applications cancelled after investigation is small. But these figures do not take into account applications that have been withdrawn by the prospective student themselves. One prospective black student told The Independent that he decided to pull out of the application process after he found Ucas’s investigation to be “intimidating”. Samuel Babarinde, who had his application flagged by Ucas during this academic year, said: “I have been very emotionally distressed by this whole process. I felt I had been singled out. “It felt like I was already guilty before being found guilty. It was intimidating and frustrating.”We need to start addressing the problem of racism in universitiesHalf of UK students have witnessed racism at university, says surveyUniversity investigates racism claims after banana thrown at graduateNUS black students officer Ilyas Nagdee said: “I am almost lost for words in being able to understand how something like that has been allowed to take place. “And how a process – which many people thought of as just being the vehicle to university applications – is also fuelling prejudice.“It will make a lot of people lose trust in Ucas, so they urgently have to take steps to rectify that. Helen Thorne, external relations director at Ucas, said: “I am not aware of any way really that unconscious bias could creep into this. Our fraud and verification team have equality and ersity training as well.”However, Ucas will be carrying out research to understand what is driving the higher figures – and the organisation expects to publish these findings in a report alongside the data.Ms Thorne added: “If it shows that there is an issue – we don’t know today whether there is an issue – then we will also set out what we will do about it.”Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National

We will now be publishing data on fraud and verification activities with a breakdown by applicant characteristics on an annual basis.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want to make sure that students have access to our world class universities, no matter what their background or race. And while we have seen record entry rates at universities across all ethnic groups, we recognise there is more to do.“That is why we have already produced guidance asking the Office for Students to push universities, particularly those that are highly selective, to close the gap in access faster.“The prime minister has also launched a race disparity audit and a programme of work to tackle disparities across all levels of society – including employment, education and criminal justice.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Generally speaking, the structure of the molecule comes from adenine binding with thymine and cytosine binding with guanine, but this is not the case with the i-motif.In order to locate the i-motifs inside human cells, the scientists designed tiny probes that could recognise the DNA knots.The probes were made using antibodies – Y-shaped molecules that bind with specific substances. In this case, the antibody was engineered so that it would attach itself to i-motifs but not to any other form of DNA.The scientists added fluorescent dyes to the antibody probes, meaning they could then monitor where exactly the i-motifs were located in the cells.New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsWhen they applied their probes to three different varieties of human cells, they identified fluorescent green spots appearing in the nucleus of each cell they looked at.“What excited us most is that we could see the green spots – the i-motifs – appearing and disappearing over time, so we know that they are forming, dissolving and forming again,” said Dr Mahdi Zeraati, whose research underpins the new paper.“We think the coming and going of the i-motifs is a clue to what they do. It seems likely that they are there to help switch genes on or off, and to affect whether a gene is actively read or not.”The researchers also think this transient nature is the reason this form of DNA has eluded scientists for so long. “It’s exciting to uncover a whole new form of DNA in cells,” said Professor Dinger. “These findings will set the stage for a whole new push to understand what this new DNA shape is really for, and whether it will impact on health and disease.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This marks a considerably higher increase than the previous financial year, when it rose by 6 per cent.Low income is the biggest single – and fastest growing – reason for referral to food banks, accounting for 28 per cent of referrals compared to 26 per cent in the previous year. Analysis of trends over time demonstrates it has significantly increased since April 2016.Plan to cut benefit sanctions shelved, sending poorest to food banksThe places in most need of food banks across Britain, mappedChildren are the hidden victims of Britain\u0027s food poverty crisis Being in debt also accounted for an increasing percentage of referrals – at 9 per cent of referrals up from 8 per cent in the past year. The cost of housing and utility bills are increasingly driving food bank referrals for this reason, with the proportion of referrals due to housing debt and utility bill debt increasing significantly since April 2016.The other main primary referral reasons in the past year were benefit delays (24 per cent) and benefit changes (18 per cent). Reduction in benefit value” have the fastest growth rate of all referrals made due to a benefit change, while those due to “moving to a different benefit” have also grown significantly.It comes amid growing concerns over the rollout of universal credit, which has been identified as a significant factor in the rise in food bank use.Analysis by the Trussell Trust of food banks that have been in full universal credit rollout areas for a year or more shows they saw an average increase of 52 per cent in the twelve months after the full rollout date in their area, compared to twelve months before. Food banks that are either not in full universal credit areas, or only in full rollout areas for up to three months, meanwhile showed an average increase of 13 per cent.In light of the findings, the Trussell Trust is calling for benefit levels to be uprated in line with inflation to ensure payments keep pace with the cost of living, particularly for disabled people and families with dependent children who are particularly at risk of needing a food bank.It is also recommending that a requirement is placed on local authorities to deliver a “Universal Support service” to everyone who starts a universal credit claim, and asking for an urgent inquiry into poor administration within Universal Credit, so errors can be quickly resolved.Emma Revie, chief executive of the charity, said: “It’s hard to break free from hunger if there isn’t enough money coming in to cover the rising cost of absolute essentials like food and housing. For too many people staying above water is a daily struggle. It’s completely unacceptable that anyone is forced to turn to a foodbank as a result.  Plan to cut benefit sanctions shelved, sending poorest to food banks“Universal credit is the future of our benefits system. It’s vital we get it right,  and ensure levels of payment keep pace with the rising cost of essentials, particularly for groups of people we know are already more likely to need a foodbank - disabled people, people dealing with an illness, families with children and single parents.Tess Lanning, director of the Living Wage Foundation, highlighted the impact of low earnings on food bank use, saying: “Many of those who are going hungry are also working, with one-in-six households referred to foodbanks in work.Our own research found over a third of parents working full-time and earning less than the real Living Wage are now regularly skipping meals. That’s why we need to see more businesses step up, go beyond the government minimum, and commit to pay a Living Wage based on the cost of living.”A spokesperson for the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) meanwhile said: The Trussell Trust’s latest annual data return make for difficult but crucial reading.This situation cannot continue, and IFAN support the Trussell Trust’s call for benefit levels to be uprated in line with inflation to ensure payments keep pace with the cost of living for the current cap on the proportion of income at which advance payments of universal credit must be repaid to be lowered and for an urgent inquiry into the administration of universal credit to tackle payment errors and delays.A DWP spokesman said: “The reasons why people use food banks are complex, so it’s wrong to link a rise to any one cause.“This research is based on anecdotal evidence from a small, self-selecting sample of less than 0.04 per cent of current universal credit claimants, whereas universal credit is working for the vast majority who claim it.  UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrince William arrives at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital with his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte after his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, gave birth to a sonKenya\u0027s Eliud Kipchoge crosses the finish line to win the men\u0027s elite race at the London Marathon 2018Team England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

Research by Global Wireless Solutions (GWS) showed O2 was the best performing network, with Vodafone ranked as the worst based on testing using both Android and iOS devices in 32 cities and towns across the UK. Telefonica-owned O2 was rated the most reliable network in 17 places, while Three was most reliable in 12 – including London – and EE came out on top in three.Meanwhile, when it comes to criteria for selecting a network consumers are twice as likely to choose reliability over network speed, according to surveys and focus groups conducted by YouGov on behalf of GWS.  When asked to consider the five most important criteria in selecting an operator more than two thirds (69 per cent) of respondents selected making calls, while 53 per cent selected texting, followed by 43 per cent who chose internet browsing. Just 3 per cent of consumers listed watching videos as a key function. “There is too much focus on ranking operators by data speed versus other key network performance aspects such as reliability and customer satisfaction. The message we received loud and clear is that consumers want to know which network they can rely on to keep them connected to friends and family or to provide access to content,” said GWS chief executive Paul Carter.  “Our testing showed that all operators currently provide mobile internet quick enough to stream a video from Netflix, but the real issue is which network will let you call, text and browse the internet most reliably.”According to GWS’s research, the most common problems reported by phone users were apps failing to load, text messages not sending, and calls either not connecting or dropping mid-conversation. The survey also found that more than 500,000 18 to 34-year-olds admit to throwing their phone down in anger when they lose signal.“Consumers have told us that the persistent issue of mobile signal not-spots around the country is clearly infuriating them. Our testing shows that local authorities in big cities like London and Birmingham need to work more closely with network operators to ensure network coverage is not being held back by red tape,” said Mr Carter.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA boy walks on a pile of garbage covering a drain in New DelhiNewly ordained priests lie on the floor as Pope Francis leads a mass in Saint Peter\u0027s Basilica at the VaticanSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.
