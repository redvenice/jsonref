He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8829c9aaceee8d7d6c89ad59f8993f368775fa8f/0_198_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c27d0ee1dbfff0a5410a1215374c8","title":"the big picture a tender family moment with jfk","story":"A candid shot of the young senator by Life magazine’s Ed Clark portrayed him as a man to lead a new generation into a new decadeEd Clark, a Life magazine staff photographer, was commissioned to photograph the Kennedy family at home in Georgetown in 1958. JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for Life did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.Clark, who was based in Tennessee, had made his name in the aftermath of war, photographing the Nuremberg trials, and the bombed-out ruins of Germany and France. In 1962, aged only 51 and at the height of his powers, he was forced to give up his career at Life because of failing eyesight. A new surgical procedure partly restored his vision in 1980 and he returned to photography for the remaining 20 years of his life. The picture of Caroline Kennedy in her crib is included in a new book taken from the photographer’s personal archive. When he became president, JFK hung Clark’s picture in pride of place in the Oval Office Jackie purchased 75 prints.

After almost two decades, the supermarket’s deal with online grocer Ocado draws to a close at the end of August.Ocado ditched Waitrose in favour of a new contract with Marks \u0026amp Spencer, meaning Waitrose customers need to register with waitrose to order groceries online.Waitrose has invested £100m in its online offer, including the opening of a second fulfilment centre in Enfield, north London, which has helped it to double online orders, with a third site scheduled to open at the end of the year.An effective loyalty scheme may be one way to reward shoppers if the price match promise is ditched, independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said, adding that John Lewis would never be able to market itself as the cheapest place to shop.As part of its plans to remodel its business following the coronavirus crisis, John Lewis has launched a furniture rental scheme.A few days after it began to offer 50 items from its range, including sofas, beds and coffee tables, through a third-party site, Fat Llama, the majority were already sold out.The scheme makes sense for John Lewis, said retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, but she does not believe it is the main way for the group to transform its business in a retail landscape increasingly dominated by Amazon.“One thing the high street has fallen back on is expertise, its service,” said Hardcastle, adding that customers, especially those aged 40 and older, would also pay for advice.“A John Lewis customer tends to be my age and up, I’m in my 40s, I don’t have all the answers and I would quite like a conversation with someone. With 40 to 50 years of buying left, that’s a pretty solid market to go into.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8940fbf1ed09c453d13cc3a84cf21550321b636c/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f115f9ea154b4c76400f20ee561d8d2d","title":"price of gold should not determine us monetary policy","story":"Even if the only objective was low and stable inflation it would be a bad ideaThe price of gold reached an all-time high of $2,000 per ounce in early August. And while mainstream economists have treated gold as a sideshow since the world abandoned the gold standard in 1971, this recent price increase is a significant signal.Three explanations for the elevated gold price – related to US monetary policy, risk and investors’ growing desire for a safe-haven alternative to the dollar – have been offered. Each contains some truth.The US Federal Reserve has eased monetary policy aggressively since the onset of the coronavirus recession in March. True, there currently is little sign of inflation – for centuries a major motive for holding gold. But rising goods prices are not the only sign of easy money. Today’s low real interest rates, depreciated dollar and high stock prices – not to mention the size of the Fed’s balance sheet – all reflect the Fed’s accommodative monetary-policy stance.A low real interest rate is often associated with a high real price of gold, both in theory and empirically. After all, the long-time argument that gold doesn’t pay interest is less persuasive when other assets are also yielding scant returns.The last decade confirms the correlation. The gold price was almost as high as it is now in 2011-12, during the Fed’s second and third rounds of quantitative easing (QE). It then fell to $1,200 per ounce during the “taper tantrum” that followed the then Fed chair Ben Bernanke’s May 2013 announcement of plans to end QE.Another age-old reason to invest in gold is to hedge against risk because the gold price, although highly variable, tends to correlate relatively weakly with prices of other securities. For obvious reasons, risk perceptions have been elevated since February, as reflected in policy uncertainty indices and the Vix (the so-called fear index). Gold is typically one of several safe-haven assets to which risk-averse investors flee.Although the dollar has long been the world’s leading safe-haven currency, the increasing eagerness of many investors’ to ersify their holdings partly reflects Donald Trump’s weaponisation of the greenback, using – or abusing – its status as the leading international reserve currency to enforce unilateral US sanctions extraterritorially. Another likely factor is widespread loss of confidence in the competence of US governance, with the most egregious example being Trump’s mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic.The end of the dollar’s preeminence has been prematurely declared many times and no obvious challenger has yet emerged. The world’s second most important currency, the euro, lags far behind the dollar in measures of international use. Meanwhile, the Chinese yuan, heralded as a potential challenger not long ago, is only fifth, seventh, or eighth in the rankings, depending on the criterion used.Gold is not a currency but it rivals the dollar as an international reserve asset and has thus benefited from the desire for ersification. Moreover, the dollar’s depreciation since April against the euro and most other major currencies itself partly explains the increase in the dollar price of gold.The heyday of the international gold standard (under which most leading currencies were convertible into gold) ended in 1914, with the advent of the first world war. But the arrangement continued to play an important role until August 1971, when President Nixon surprised the world by abruptly ending the dollar’s convertibility into gold.Today, however, the gold standard is of more than antiquarian interest. In January, Trump nominated Judy Shelton – who made her reputation as a dyed-in-the-wool proponent of the gold standard – to be one of the seven governors on the Federal Reserve Board. The Senate banking committee voted to approve her, along party lines, on July 21, and her appointment could come up for a final vote as early as September.Shelton’s views go beyond nostalgia. “Let’s go back to the gold standard,” she wrote in February 2009. She favours abolishing the fiat dollar as legal tender.Had the Fed instead followed the gold market, it would have tightened monetary policy in 2010, prolonging the period of high unemployment, and loosened policy in 2018. Stimulus was again the right decision when the coronavirus recession hit – but true believers in gold would take the recent record price as a sign that the Fed should tighten policy aggressively.Then there is Shelton’s ideological inconsistency. As soon as the prospect of attaining high office arose, she contradicted her long-standing philosophy in order to say what Trump wanted to hear – namely, that the Fed should loosen monetary policy even faster.Were Shelton to join the Fed board, neither the price of gold nor what is good for the economy would likely determine her vote. Should the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, win in November, she would almost certainly reconnect with gold and rediscover the urgent need to tighten policy – even if the economy is still very weak. But if Trump is re-elected, she will probably vote to double down on the current monetary stimulus, even if inflation revives.We have become accustomed to toadyism and cronyism under Trump, from the justice department to the US Postal Service. Until now, the Fed has been blessedly free of these scourges – but perhaps not for much longer.• Jeffrey Frankel is a professor at Harvard University’s John F Kennedy School of Government.

Now it is under threat, with potentially huge consequences for our cities and social livesIt is 7.45 on a Monday morning and I am heading for the office. It is my first visit to the  for more than four months, but the prime minister wants us back at work. Commuters are reliable, law-abiding creatures of habit, cogs in a greater machine I am doing what I am told.On the way out of the house, I pass a 1910 Underground poster in the hall, extolling the merits of my particular suburb. “Live in a New Neighbourhood,” it reads, under a picture, by the artist Alfred France, of a brown country mouse welcoming a grey town mouse to a semi-rural idyll. “24 minutes from Piccadilly Circus, including change at Baker St. 6d per day for season ticket.”One hundred and ten years on (and for a bit more than 6d), I am living that same dream. But at Dollis Hill station, now on the Jubilee line, there are very few other commuters waiting on the platform. Before Covid-19, in the rush hour, you would often have to ruck and maul just to get on to a train. Today, there are only three people, masked and well-distanced, in the carriage. It does not get much busier as the journey continues. A couple more at Willesden Green, once a rural area with a few grand houses – until about 1870, when the builders moved in and began turning it into a working-class suburb for a new breed of commuter.The tube has never been a place for striking up friendly conversations. With masks and distancing, it is more eyes-down-make-no-contact than ever. Social media is an easier space to approach strangers. My eye was caught by a tweet from a passenger on the 8.08 from Surbiton to Waterloo, usually one of the busiest commuter trains in the country, with a video clip showing the empty carriage. Surbiton, AKA Suburbiton, is quintessential commuter belt, home to Tom and Barbara in the 70s sitcom The Good Life and likely the inspiration for the fictional Climthorpe, where the salaryman Reggie hit his midlife crisis in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin.“The 8.08’s usually pretty busy – I’d be standing in the door somewhere,” Charlie Deacon, who posted the video, tells me on the phone. He did not chat to his fellow commuters. “I recognised the same people most days, but I didn’t really know anyone.”Deacon, who works for a renewable energy company, worked from home throughout lockdown, but he has started coming in to the office once a week. “I’ve always been a proponent of flexible working, but it is also nice to have that one day in the office, to see the whites of people’s eyes.”Team meetings and complex projects are better dealt with in person than via video calls and endless emails, he says. But Deacon never wants to commute five days a week again. “I’m a lot less stressed, I don’t have to deal with the train, I’m saving lots of money I’m getting more sleep, more time to exercise, with my partner, to do other things in the evenings … It’s totally positive.”The journey, when he makes it, is a breeze, with seats available and space to breathe and distance, as his video shows. “This is about as busy as it gets,” mumbles a woman wearing a hi-vis jacket, a mask and a visor as she directs a handful of people in and out of King’s Cross station, where I emerge on my journey to work.Once upon a time, people walked to work, which tended to be in a field near where they lived. But the Industrial Revolution changed all that. You know the story: with industrialisation came urbanisation. Cities grew: Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow, as well as London. People flocked to them for work that was better paid than the work in the field and not seasonal. The downside was that these cities became filthy, overcrowded, polluted and diseased places.So, from the latter part of the 18th century into the Victorian era, those who could afford it started to move out to new suburbs and even the countryside beyond. As it was too far to walk to work, spiders’ webs began to appear on city maps – suburban rail networks. “Up to then, the purpose of the train was to get from one city to another,” says the author and historian Simon Webb, who probably knows more about the history of commuting than anyone else, having written a book on the subject. “As commuting took off, the purpose of railways became to bring people from one part of a city to another.”Webb’s book, Commuters: The History of a British Way of Life, looks at how commuting shaped our cities and gave rise to suburban railways, buses and underground trains (the first passengers rode the politan railway in London in 1863). From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the rise of commuting was steady, with the odd surge, such as when buses or trams were introduced. Then, between the wars, it was like rush hour: one-third of the British population became commuters, thanks to unplanned development, with new urban areas springing up on the fringes of cities, and because of the mutually beneficial relationships that developed between railway companies and builders.Think of a commuter and whom do you see? Suited, probably male, takes himself quite seriously, a little humourless. Or the Reggie Perrin character, trapped in a railway carriage of hell, somewhere near Surbiton, but going nowhere in life. But today a commuter is as likely to be a nurse, a security guard, a cleaner, a cabinet minister or a “super-commuter” jetting in from her place in Nice every week.Even before Covid-19, Webb was wondering whether the commuter was dying out, because of the gentrification and recolonisation of city centres. It is happening to the centres of Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and London – right here in King’s Cross, to where I have commuted. Until recently, it was dirty and dodgy after dark. Now it has sprouted shiny towers, desirable vertical urban living spaces. If I were wealthier, I might aspire to relocate here from my suburb. I can picture the poster: town mouse encouraging suburban mouse to come to where it is all happening.The pandemic means that, for many, it is no longer necessary to leave home, let alone your neighbourhood, to go to work. This may have the effect of making people more insular and isolated, says Webb. He tells me about some people who, during the Crusades, took off from a village in Gloucestershire when they reached Gloucester, they thought they had reached Jerusalem and prepared to fight the infidel. “Your outlook will probably become as restricted as that of a medieval peasant,” he jokes. At least, I think he is joking.A note of caution from Joe Moran, a social historian and a professor of English and cultural history at Liverpool John Moores University. Many key workers, he points out, don’t have the luxury of telecommuting “because they can’t do their work remotely. It’s non-key work that is more likely to disappear into fibre-optic cables and wireless routes.” Bankers in the City of London may be able to do their jobs from home, but that is not the case for security guards or supermarket staff.As a cultural historian, Moran is wary of the idea that things change suddenly and dramatically. “I feel that there is a natural inertia,” he says. “Even if there are very good reasons why people should commute less, that’s not how people engage with the world and other people. We often do things that don’t make any sense, because we are social beings.”Just as being at work is not only about the work, so commuting is not only about commuting, says Moran. While the situationist philosophers of 60s Paris may have regarded commuting as an unwanted product of capitalism, with its unpaid labour and alienating dead space, “some people actually quite like the commute, if it’s not too long. Partly because it’s time alone. It’s a sort of third space between home and work. Particularly with new technology, you can do lots of things with that time,” he says. “There is a slightly social aspect to it as well: you spend time with these intimate strangers often you see the same people on the train every day. There is a minimal community to it.”It is more than minimal for Anna Horsley, who has a train friend. It started one day when Horsley got some bad news in a phone call the woman next to her could not help overhearing, so asked if she was all right and offered a tissue. They got chatting. Soon they were taking the same trains every day, the 7.42 out and the 6.30 home. They have seen each other since they started working from home. “She’s invited me to her wedding,” Horsley says. “She’s gone beyond train friend – she’s a proper mate now.”Horsley, a social researcher, is – or was – a super-commuter. Her journey from Northampton to Westminster, by bike, train, tube and foot, took two hours. Then two hours home again in the evening. And she misses it. “I certainly don’t miss the cost of it, but I miss the routine it gave me. I find it harder to switch off and to get into work mode – I get out of bed and walk into my office, so I have no mental preparation for the day. And I tend to work past my hours.”Moran concedes that, when this is over: “People will have got used to working from home and it will be tolerated more. My workplace tended to encourage people to be present before presumably, those kind of attitudes will change. I think there’ll be less commuting, but I’m sure it will still go on. The key is to be flexible: if people want to go into work, they should be able to if they can work from home, that’s great as well.”This makes sense. Where does it leave me, though? I know where I am physically: I have done my commute, from a suburb created by commuting, along the world’s first metropolitan commuter railway, to a city centre abandoned by all but the poor that is now seeing the gradual return of the wealthy. I am here I have reached the office. But I don’t need to be here. I am not going in – I am off home, to work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a626e46ed99243ec658e348f4a72e6bfecf8426/0_101_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e063d20cea2fb8d7dafca60621f8e05b","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

You’ll probably first think of becoming a doctor or a nurse, but in reality there are more than 350 different careers, not all of which are patient-facing. There are a host of specialist vocational qualifications in healthcare on offer at universities, and degrees in IT, computing, English or maths can open the door to jobs in health informatics, communications and finance too. Here are three unusual healthcare degrees and where they could take you.BSc (Hons) in operating department practiceThis three-year undergraduate degree leads to a professional qualification as an operating department practitioner (ODP). ODPs work in all three phases of surgical care. They are responsible for supporting the patient during the anaesthetic phase ahead of surgery, as well as preparing surgical equipment and drugs. During surgery, they are the link between the surgeon and the rest of the operating theatre team and are responsible for the surgical equipment and handing what is needed to the surgeon.After surgery, ODPs support the patient in the recovery unit, monitor them and decide when they can safely be transferred back on to a ward. With postgraduate training, ODPs can go on to become surgical care practitioners – qualified to complete certain surgical procedures under the supervision of a consultant surgeon.BSc (Hons) healthcare science degreeWhen this degree is included in the NHS practitioner training programme, it can open the door to a career as a healthcare scientist. Health scientists have a crucial role in helping to prevent, diagnose and treat illness by applying their scientific knowledge and technical skills. They rely on highly specialised equipment to analyse body tissue, blood and other bodily fluids and many will also have direct patient contact working in clinics or hospital wards.The degree is a mix of academic and practice-based learning, which can lead to different specialist roles. Students spend the first two years undergoing broad scientific training and choose which branch of health science to specialise in for their final year. The five options are: cardiovascular, respiratory and sleep sciences neurosensory sciences life sciences clinical engineering or medical physics technology.Master’s in nursing (dual registration)This four-year degree, studied as an undergraduate, offers students the opportunity to qualify in two branches of nursing rather than the single branch of the traditional three-year programme. The combinations are: adult and child adult and learning disability adult and mental health learning disability and child mental health and child and mental health and learning disability. The master’s is also seen as a fast-track route for a career in nursing research or education. From September, all nursing degree students in England qualify for a non- refundable annual maintenance grant of £5,000. An extra £3,000 is available for eligible students.University studies and practical placements helped prepare Sam Harris for his first months as a paramedic, ahead of the global health emergencyWhen Sam Harris started his foundation degree to become an NHS paramedic in 2017 he never imagined he would find himself on the frontline of a national and global health emergency when he graduated.Harris, who went to Staffordshire University, joined South Western ambulance service NHS foundation trust as a newly qualified paramedic last October – just five months before the lockdown.He admits: “It was a baptism of fire. Even colleagues who had been on the job for 25 years said they had never experienced anything like it. The main role for us was going to visit unwell patients who had been self-isolating at home and whose Covid-19 had got worse to take them to hospital.“There was also a lot of public education – going out to patients who were experiencing virus symptoms but who were confused about the guidelines and rang 999 in a blind panic.”Harris, 22, says his university studies and placements prepared him well for his first months on the road.“You spend half your time on placement – the first after just three months,” he says. “You get to know the processes and the detail of how things work and then you take what you learn with you on the road.”Harris says he always wanted to be a paramedic. “The more I looked at it the more I realised what a brilliant job it is and I just fell in love with it. I like having the ability to do a really small thing which can have a massive influence on somebody’s life – and when I started the job that’s something I noticed very quickly that I could achieve.”From next September, the paramedic profession will become graduate-only, with an accredited three-year degree needed to practise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d291a14eb4cb04550b8355337b0d86ed3a84723d/100_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eef4c6a50e4e54bc4d2a4f0603abc1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos including rescued pangolins and hyacinth macaws"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a876a1b75a4259847a578866acd5177c5951fea/0_0_2864_1719/master/2864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a43168c71129c78a3d5e7fe95276d3b0","title":"the witches roald dahl nicolas roeg","story":"Nicolas Roeg’s cruel adaptation of Roald Dahl’s tale of bloodthirsty child-killers remains a remarkably sadistic studio film for kidsIf there’s one defining image from Nicolas Roeg’s zippy yet cruel adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches, it’s that of Anjelica Huston ebulliently pushing a stranger’s baby carriage down towards a cliff edge. While a gory death might then be averted, it’s an almost unfathomably sadistic moment, a shocking act of hate contained within a glossy PG-rated studio fantasy. Even 30 years on, as the line between films aimed at children and teenagers blurs ever more, Roeg’s 90 minutes of mostly unfettered nastiness remains a startling watch, a bitter little fairy tale to keep kids up at night with a fear of torturous death.What makes The Witches so horribly effective, both on page and screen, is that this fear is aimed at a group that children have traditionally been taught to see as safe. It’s not just that the antagonists are women, it’s that they’re women who are made to resemble harmless family friends or neighbours, aunts or teachers, figures we expect to coo over babies, not try to murder them. Hollywood has forever fed into reductive and tiresome stereotypes of women as either mothers or molls, usually identified by their feelings towards kids. We’ve seen in countless films that a woman who loses a child also loses her sanity too, and that women unable to conceive are instead driven to steal a baby from elsewhere. The women we’re shown who don’t want children are usually glamorous femme fatales whose disinterest in motherhood is explained away by a more general sociopathy or unwanted spinsters who have seen their lives amount to nothing as a result. In The Witches, a large cross-section of women didn’t just not want children but they wanted to kill everyone else’s, an unapologetic and bloodthirsty desire for a child-free world.Various feminist critics of Dahl’s book and Roeg’s movie expressed distaste with its portrayal of childless women as murderous hags, although in recent years, some have seen it as more forward thinking and less misogynist in its worldview. Author Caroline Kepnes views it as “a hilarious, feminist commentary on women, work and family” where men are ineffective and women possess more power, something that might prove horrifying to those frantically upholding the patriarchy. In an ingenious, info-packed intro, we’re given a beginner’s guide to witches courtesy of Mai Zetterling’s Helga, who tells her grandson Luke, Parenthood’s Jasen Fisher, how to spot one of them, an urgent lesson that could end up saving his life.They’re foul creatures with square toes and blotchy scalps but wear sensible shoes and wigs to fit in. Writing for the New Statesmen, Jemma Crew views this as a way of the story rebelling against “aesthetic rules imposed on women”, a way of showing how so many are forced into impossible beauty standards by society and how men fear and criticise those who don’t conform.Their aim is to infiltrate without detection so they can kill as many children as possible, but in order to evade capture they must avoid using “knives or guns” and instead find inventive ways to dispatch of bodies. In arguably the film’s most chilling sequence, we see a girl kidnapped by a local witch and then trapped in a painting where she’s forced to live out the rest of her life, alone, doomed, with her family, crippled, watching from outside. It’s one of many staggeringly hopeless notes we’re left to sit with, a trademark not only of the story’s original author Dahl, whose work often delved deep into gleefully nihilistic territory, but of Roeg, a director whose often perverse films were aimed squarely at an open-minded adult audience and who seemed a strange, dangerous choice for a slick Warner Brothers family movie.But somehow, hiring the guy who made a film so filthy that it was shelved and then dumped by scared studio executives before shooting arguably the sexiest sex scene ever to make a film for kids proved to be a masterstroke. Roeg’s deft and entertaining late summer critic-pleaser maintained the sourness of Dahl’s source material while also transplanting the book’s sprightly pace. Sure, children are killed, but that hurtling pace and that Stanley Myers score sure make all that killing rather fun, huh? (Myers was also an unlikely choice, best known for his work on The Deer Hunter). Bar one controversial ersion which I’ll come to, Roeg doesn’t dampen the malevolency of the novel or his unusual, uneasy style, making certain unpleasant scenes that much more unpleasant with clammy, claustrophobic close-ups and unsettling Dutch tilts, shooting it like an adult horror movie, albeit one with goofy comic elements. His careful tonal control is matched by a ferocious performance by Huston as the Grand High Witch, a scene-devouring turn from an actor swiftly seesawing between camp and callous, a scary, funny and sexy villain without a visible shred of humanity.While Jim Henson’s de-wigged witches are monstrously effective (it was the last film he personally worked on before his death), it’s those in disguise that prove more nightmarish, posing as polite and unremarkable representatives for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. So while Huston’s unmasking scene remains a showstopper, there’s something more long-lasting about the surreal image of well-dressed women scouring the Cornish bluffs for a child they want to turn into a mouse. They succeed at downsizing our hero Luke, but he then goes on to destroy this particular coven before setting his sights on witches worldwide. This is where that aforementioned ersion comes into play. A happier ending was written that saw Luke turned back into a boy by a defecting witch who uses her magic powers for good, a spoonful of sugar heaped over the original, darker finale, which saw Luke remain a rodent. Dahl was incensed, and so Roeg agreed to shoot both endings and see which one test audiences preferred. Predictably, the happier endnote won out, and in response, Dahl threatened to take his name off the film, something Henson later urged him against (he still referred to the finished product as “utterly appalling”).Watching the 1990 original as an adult, nightmares long behind me, it’s a relief to see just how justified my earlier troubled reaction was, the product of a vicious little film that even now strikes a far nastier note than the majority of family-friendly studio offerings. It’s very much part of a particular era of darker kids films alongside Return to Oz, The Dark Crystal and Something Wicked This Way Comes, all of which were similar box office disasters, a sign that kids wanted to be amused rather than scared. While my briefly traumatised eight-year-old self might not agree, there’s something important about experiencing at least a somewhat neutered, PG-friendly form of horror at a young age. “Being scared is a rite of passage,” children’s author Joanna Nadin once said, “but a pleasurable one. I don’t see the gain in mollycoddling.”Dahl and Roeg’s portrayal of purple-eyed child-killing sadists might be fantastical but it’s also brutally effective, a salient reminder for younger viewers to be more aware of their surroundings and to use trust sparingly. There’s no straight-laced PSA about not talking to strangers that could have achieved that fear quite so brilliantly as watching a boy get turned into a mouse or a girl get trapped in a painting. The Witches is a scary movie for kids who need scaring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05bec7ab8a464c64c939f76bd2e70bdaa615ff34/0_288_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0ccd9e6bb7899c77ffe9eaeb454fd84","title":"uk wine boxes bagnums bottle lockdown","story":"So called ‘bagnums’ and wine boxes enjoy sales boost as Britons minimise trips to the supermarket From so-called “bagnums” to “cardbordeaux”, bag-in-box wines have enjoyed a sales surge in the UK during lockdown as Britons opted for better value for money and fewer trips to the supermarket.Amid the easing of lockdown the boom in UK camping and picnicking is now helping to drive sales, as consumers have recognised the portability, convenience and eco-credentials of the new-style products. The packaging means little oxygen enters even once it has been opened, so wine stays fresher for longer – up to six weeks – than in a bottle.The Co-op has bolstered its 12 bag-in-box range (which includes Fairtrade red and white) by an additional six wines in order to meet demand, and is currently trialling a premium dry rosé.Sarah Benson, wine buyer at Co-op, said people were buying into boxed wine because they could get more in a single purchase and it allowed customers to share the wine among a wider group than a smaller bottle. M\u0026ampS winemaker Belinda Kleinig said: “Pouches have definitely gone upmarket: as packaging technology has improved, so too has wine quality, and customers are now happy to bring out their pouches at picnics and parties.”“Lockdown gave bag-in-box wine a real opportunity to shine,” said Sainsbury’s wine buyer Hugh Browne. “Shoppers could get the same great taste in a larger container that kept their wine fresh for six weeks from opening, with fewer trips to the shops.”The tipple is attracting a more erse customer base as more brands enter the market and quality has increased, said Tesco. The company also highlighted the appeal of its eco-credentials – it’s more environmentally friendly than transporting glass bottles.

Evra has led me to his secret bench because we can talk here for more than two hours about his complex life.Evra is well-known for his Instagram videos in which he shouts “I love this game” while singing along to Marvin Gaye, with or without Paul Pogba, or wearing a Panda costume as his gleeful way of undercutting racism. “I want to spread that positive message,” he says while acknowledging his own “dark energy”. After being racially abused he kicked one of his club’s fans at Marseille in 2017. Evra was also insulted in racial terms by Luis Suárez in 2011. He played in five Champions League finals and was one of Alex Ferguson’s favourite players in five Premier League-winning campaigns.But so much has happened in a strange and difficult year that Evra asked to do this interview. He often makes me laugh but, now, he is sombre. He remembers how, as one of 24 children in his family, he had to beg and steal on the streets of Paris. The 39-year-old also recalls how the prejudice that tested him during his career continues today. “Silence is a crime,” Evra says. “You can’t be in silence any more.”Evra grew up in Les Ulis, a gritty commune in Paris where his feisty spark was forged. He is now fluent in six languages but his early opportunities were limited. “The first time I learn about people of colour at school it was to do with slavery. In France you talk about the revolution and Napoleon. But when you talk about people with coloured skin it’s slavery. Even now I’ve got friends who say: ‘Patrice, we love you. But it will be difficult if my daughter or son is with a coloured guy or woman because my grandparents won’t accept it.’ But those people have to be strong like I’ve been strong all my life.“I know it’s not easy. One of my brothers is called Mamadou. When he calls for a job, as soon as he says Mamadou they hang up. He changed his name to Claude and got some jobs. But it’s not enough to say no to racism. Let’s educate people.”Evra points to a raggedy pigeon drifting across the grey river. “I like this so much,” he says. “Sitting here, talking like this, looking at the pigeons.” This is Evra’s engaging way. He grips my arm or whoops whenever something thrills him.“When I went to Sicily I was 17,” he says, remembering his first professional club, Marsala, in Serie C, in 1998. “A kid and his dad keep looking at me. They come close and the dad said: ‘Can I have a picture?’ I think: ‘Wow. I’m already famous.’ The kid start to touch my skin. His dad says: ‘But why didn’t you wash your body?’”Was it the first time they saw a black person in Sicily? “Exactly. I was not angry as they were not educated. My teammates were the same. They welcomed me but they ask: ‘Do you know how to use your phone?’ I call this ignorance so I wasn’t sad. I loved Sicily and the people.

When I do the message against racism I dress up in a panda costume because I want to educate the kids. The panda bear is black, white and chubby. I want kids to be like that panda. Be cool, be funny but respect everyone.”Did Salvioni find out? “No,” Evra exclaims. “I ran the other way. A year later I started playing left-wing. Then the left-back is injured in a game. Salvioni say: ‘Patrice, go left-back.’ I play an amazing game and we won 2–1. The next game he said: ‘Patrice, left-back.’ I said: ‘No. I’m not a left-back.’ He said: ‘OK, someone else play.’ I decided to try. Salvioni said: ‘You’re going to become the best left-back in the world because you hate that position.’”“The new generation are softer than we used to be. I give you an example. At half-time we’re beating Tottenham 2-0. Everyone’s saying: ‘Patrice, you’re playing amazing.’ The worst is when Ferguson stays quiet. He was quiet that day for five minutes. He looks straight in my eyes. ‘Patrice, do you think you’re playing good?’ I say: ‘Yeah.’ Ferguson says: ‘I saw you pass the ball back to Van der Saar.’“‘Yes, boss, but just one.’ He said: ‘If you pass the ball back again I take you off because this is one of your worst games.’“My eyes start burning because I don’t like the injustice. We won 4-0 and the next day I go to Ferguson’s office. ‘Hello, son, what’s the problem?’ ‘Boss, the problem is yesterday.’ Ferguson says: ‘Patrice, some players were disrespecting the opposition. I wanted everyone focused. I picked you to give them the message because you’re strong.’”When the manager wanted to rest him against Stoke, Evra told Ferguson: “I will rest when I die. I’m playing this game.” Ferguson replied: “Sorry, I’ve already picked the team.” Evra remained adamant that only he could outjump Peter Crouch in the Stoke attack. “He didn’t say anything,” Evra says of Ferguson. “The day of the game he put the team up and I was starting. I played a great game. Afterwards he shakes my hand and say: ‘Patrice, you’ve got balls.’“We are still so close now. I speak to the boss three times a month and his nephews love my videos. One day he texted me: ‘Patrice, I love that video.’ I say: ‘Boss, one day you give me the hairdryer, now you’re laughing about my videos.’”Before the Champions League final in 2008, when United beat Chelsea, Ferguson “gave the best speech ever. He didn’t talk football. He said: ‘Imagine Patrice with his 24 brothers and sisters. His parents have to feed them all on a bad street.’ He talked about Rooney growing up in a tough part of Liverpool. Carlos Tevez coming from Argentina. He talked about difficulties for other players. He then said: ‘This is my victory. We have already won the Champions League. Enjoy the game.’ Even now I’m having goosebumps.“When Ferguson left, United lost their DNA, their philosophy. He was inspiring so much respect, so much fear, and if any player starts thinking he is bigger than the team then he destroyed you. The players always wanted to play for Ferguson. I tried my best for David Moyes but I knew it would be a disaster because players won’t respect him like that. It was a mission impossible.”Evra’s former wife, Sandra, wanted to leave Manchester and he agreed to accept an offer from Juventus in 2014 – only to decide he might stay once he heard that Antonio Conte, who wanted to entice him to Turin, would become Italy’s manager. Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, triggered an option to extend Evra’s contract for a year.A year later, in June 2015, Evra played for Juventus in the Champions League final. “My ex-wife said: ‘See? Manchester are nearly in the Championship and you’re in this final.’ I love Juventus but I said: ‘Even if they’re in the Championship, I prefer to be at United. Nothing can replace my love for them.’”“United can’t challenge Liverpool or Man City. Not yet. There’s been massive damage but we’re moving in the right direction. When they wanted to sign Bruno Fernandes, Ole texted me. I asked for advice from Cristiano Ronaldo. Cristiano says: ‘Bruno’s a good guy and very professional.’ I say: ‘Ole, I’ve spoken with Cristiano. Let’s go for it.’ And Fernandes had a massive impact. Without him I don’t think we would have qualified for the Champions League.”Pogba has seemed more settled recently but he is often a controversial figure. “Paul’s really misunderstood. People talk more about his hairstyle but he’s a great kid, a shy boy actually. It was important for Fernandes to relieve that attention on Paul. It wasn’t fair. Paul is a happy person and we have been close so long. He Facetimed me yesterday at 11.30pm. I said: ‘Paul, I’m in bed. Let me sleep.’”It feels like a new start for Evra now he is separated from his wife. “We were together 25 years and have two children. But after some difficult times we were no longer sharing the same roof. We would only meet around family moments. It’s never nice to orce but I have a new love and positive energy with Margaux.”Margaux, his fiancee, is a Danish model whom Evra takes me to meet at their apartment. She is warm and friendly and Evra says: “She makes me softer. She controls my fire, that dark energy. I am tranquil now.”When Jamie Carragher apologised to him recently for Liverpool’s actions, Evra was “so surprised but grateful. I also received a letter from Liverpool’s owner apologising. People were trying to distract me and say: ‘This happened nine years ago. They’re taking the piss.’ But it’s better late than never. I forgive and have more respect for Liverpool.”The abuse he suffered from one of his club’s fans at Marseille, and Evra’s violent reaction, was more upsetting. “He said I am a monkey and he was threatening to cut my throat, and the throats of my kids. I reacted because I’m human. I have since done a lot of meditation and it helps.”He is keen to deny accusations of sexism when he applauded, in a seemingly patronising way, the well-researched punditry of Eni Aluko during the 2018 World Cup. “When someone is good, I clap. She was very good and knows football. It was unfair to say I was patronising because I know the strength of women. My mum had 13 kids and educated every single one. Even when she lost her leg she became stronger. My mum is my hero. So I want to do so much to promote women in football. I also feel very strongly about the rights of gay people and want to support them in football and life.”Evra is “involved in many projects from my foundation to two orphanages in Senegal. But a Premier League team contacted my agent to see if I will play again. They saw how fit I am in my videos.”Evra insists on driving me from Battersea to Clapham Junction. Sunshine streams across an afternoon framed by the world’s current uncertainty and I wonder if Evra, who has fire and ice within him, could fulfil Ferguson’s prediction? “I sacrificed my life a lot being a footballer. A manager makes a double sacrifice. Right now I want to make people laugh and think.”It feels like a happy and reflective pause for the man who kicked out against racism, won many titles in different countries, played 81 times for France, bonded with Ferguson, crooned What’s Going On to Marvin Gaye and impersonated a panda. From Les Ulis to Battersea, it’s been an incredible journey. The next step, for Patrice Evra, could be just as interesting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb0bda2ee59900645d8ca86f6e7bcd702fe81f8/0_170_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba4684dcca26a2c6505b8c312646a2a","title":"paul pogba to stay at manchester united and sign new deal says mino raiola","story":"Paul Pogba will not be sold by Manchester United this summer and talks over a new contract will start soon, according to the France midfielder’s agent, Mino Raiola.The World Cup winner endured a difficult 2019-20 season due to injury butended it strongly as he helped Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side to a third-place finish in the Premier League.Pogba, whose current deal runs until next summer, last month revealed his desire to win more trophies at Old Trafford.United have since been beaten in the semi-finals of both the FA Cup and the Europa League, but are back in the Champions League next season thanks to their impressive form following the resumption of the Premier League.Pogba won the 2016-17 Europa League and League Cup in his first season after returning to United from Juventus but the club have won nothing since."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b564af80296c2636b546a14024c2ffd34da65ee2/323_534_4037_2422/master/4037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f06d0886a737dae94fff99c2de55c6d7","title":"uk broadcasters netflix outbids for new shows","story":"Streaming services such as Netflix take advantage of Covid production shutdownStreaming services such as Netflix are taking advantage of the global shortage of new television programmes to outbid British channels for new shows, forcing traditional broadcasters to find new ways to fill schedules in the coming years.Although television audiences rose sharply during the coronavirus lockdown, the near-global production shutdown has created a looming shortage of new material to show to viewers in the coming months. At the same time Britain’s commercial television channels are dealing with the collapse in the advertising market caused by the recession, leaving subscription streaming services able to swoop in and spend big on new commissions to maintain their growth.John McVay, head of the trade body Pact, which represents the UK’s independent television production companies, said the circumstances posed a challenge for traditional channels. “I know a lot of people who work for streamers in acquisitions and they are buying everything,” he said. “Unless we can get new, fresh content into the British schedules that is engaging and resonates with our experience of the world we’re living through, then I fear for our broadcasters.”He said that there was a particular demand for already made shows looking for a home, as broadcasters and streamers seek to satisfy audiences that want to watch new material. “If you’ve got good quality British content that you’ve made – finished programmes – then you can charge a premium.”McVay was speaking before Monday’s start of the annual Edinburgh television festival, an event where channel controllers and independent production companies usually meet in the Scottish capital to discuss the industry’s trends.But because of the pandemic an industry that is already being transformed by streaming has also found itself having to go fully online, with speakers such as outgoing director general Tony Hall, actor Jameela Jamil, and historian David Olusoga delivering their remarks via livestreams.Stewart Clarke, the festival’s creative director, said the entire television industry was in a state of flux. He said: “The big issue is that people want to watch telly – including streaming – more than ever, but how that is funded and made is more complex than ever. It’s how you match up those two different issues.”British television production is slowly restarting, assisted by the government’s offer to cover the cost of insuring productions against coronavirus-related shutdowns, but there is still expected to be a shortage of shows.ITV has already reported a substantial drop in ad revenue, while Channel 4 has been forced to cut its programme budget. Both channels had already been struggling with changing viewing habits. Even before the lockdown more than half of the UK’s households subscribed to a streaming service, according to Ofcom, a number boosted further by the launch of Disney+, while the average age of a BBC One viewer is now in their 60s.He said the health of these channels was vital in order to sustain a distinctly British television industry. McVay said: “There are stories that we want to tell, which can only really be made by a British broadcaster. They will have no international value, but they’re important to us as citizens and to audiences.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ebeee679719879196c4ab0ef1f89214014b199/0_67_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0e54d3bd34fe706c678dfa69fce5c40","title":"reporting from latin america coronavirus has proved an intensely political story","story":"’s Latin America correspondent reflects on the humanitarian disaster that has gripped the region in recent monthsWhen I set off from Mexico City for Rio with my family in early March, for what was supposed to be a short holiday, Latin America had not recorded a single death from the coronavirus.Security staff at Mexico’s Benito Juárez airport wore face masks. A blue and red banner warned China-bound travellers to wash their hands, cover their mouths and, ominously, avoid contact with “live or death animals”.But Covid-19 still seemed a relatively distant threat that had upended the lives of friends in China but was unlikely to do the same to us. As we boarded our flight that morning we looked forward to seeing Brazilian family and showing our three-year-old son, Santiago, the sea.Five months later Latin America has been shaken by a humanitarian disaster that will inflict years of uncertainty and hardship on a land already in a profound state of flux.More than 200,000 people have died since Covid-19 gripped the region we flew over on our way from Mexico to Brazil, almost entirely oblivious to the coming storm.As the epidemic intensified, our break in Brazil morphed into one of the most draining and disturbing experiences of our lives. Holed up in a small flat in Rio, where the governor had ordered residents to stay at home, we watched in horror as Brazil’s death toll rose from zero to nearly 100,000 in just a few months.“Am-bu-lance! Am-bu-laaaance! Am-bu-laaaaance!” our son would scream excitedly each day as paramedics in full-protective gear sped past our balcony towards a nearby Covid-19 field hospital, sirens blaring.Santi had no way of comprehending the largely hidden catastrophe playing out around us. But as the days and weeks passed, and I worked on my computer trying to fathom Covid’s impact on Brazil and its neighbours, the human toll became all too clear.“The authorities are just leaving us to die,” Eduardo Javier Barrezueta Chávez, a 33-year-old resident of Guayaquil, Ecuador, told me over WhatsApp in early April from his living room, where he was sitting with his father’s decomposing remains.Days later I spoke to Gilson de Freitas, whose mother had just been consigned to a mass grave in the Brazilian city of Manaus. “It’s madness, just madness,” he told me as the city’s health and funeral services collapsed. “What are our lives worth now? Nothing.”Technology was a indispensable ally as I set about reporting Latin America’s coronavirus crisis while trapped under quarantine in Rio.Using WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom and Twitter, I tracked down and interviewed bereaved Brazilian families, Mexican doctors and Venezuelan politicians - all from the relative comfort of my son’s cramped bedroom in our temporary home.In mid-April I sat down at my laptop to speak to Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, himself sheltering in São Paulo, who warned the country’s current leader, Jair Bolsonaro, was “leading citizens to the slaughterhouse” with his reckless Covid response.Lula was right. On the day we spoke Brazil’s confirmed death toll stood at just 1,952. As I write these lines – four months later – it has swelled to more than 100,000, the second highest number in the world after the US. Back in Mexico the situation was also deteriorating, despite claims from its populist president that the virus had been “tamed”. More than 50,000 Mexicans have now died from Covid-19 – the third-worst toll.From the start we knew giving those statistics names and faces had to be a priority.We reported on the life and death of a Brazilian clown, Potato, who had entertained seriously ill children in one Rio hospital before dying there himself.With Caio Barretto Briso, one of the many talented regional stringers contributing to our coverage, we remembered the nurses, samba musicians and favela residents being lost as the pandemic ravaged their country.Other correspondents, from Puerto Ordaz, Buenos Aires and Asunción to Bogotá, Lima, Guadalajara and La Paz, paid witness to the suffering coronavirus has forced on the some of Latin America’s most vulnerable people, including Venezuelan refugees and prisoners, Mexican healthcare workers, Colombian shantytown dwellers, indigenous communities in Brazil and inhabitants of the remote Peruvian Amazon.Coronavirus has proved an intensely political story, as well as a humanitarian one, and perhaps nowhere more so than Brazil. From day one Bolsonaro has played down the epidemic, sparking international outrage, domestic protest and even accusations that he was promoting a genocide.“So what?” the far-right populist snapped as Brazil’s death toll began its inexorable rise. “I’m sorry. What do you want me to do?”As a reporter, covering the political bedlam has been exhausting and perplexing – a ceaseless deluge of fake news and fury. As the father of a young Brazilian as well as British citizen, it has been profoundly dispiriting. What hope for Santi’s South American homeland when its top leader sees tens of thousands of citizens lose their lives and shrugs: “We’ll all die one day”?A ray of light came in July, on one of our last nights in Rio before flights to Mexico resumed, when I fired up Skype for a Friday night chat with the legendary composer Caetano Veloso.Caetano, whose music was among the first things that drew me to Brazil, was crestfallen too. He feared the toxic political atmosphere could bring “great violence” to his country. He feared losing his life to Covid-19 as the epidemic escalated further. He was appalled by Bolsonaro’s foolhardy, anti-scientific response. “I think it’s sick,” the 77-year-old musician said.Yet despite this Caetano insisted he was “scandalously optimistic” about the future.“Pessimism is too convenient,” he said. “Everything that’s happening in the world right now is telling us something.”What it is telling us, none of us could say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

It’s been irrelevant for generations, and we seem to keep perpetuating it.”Nwanoku, a principal bass player in London orchestras for 35 years, founded Chineke! in 2015 to provide career opportunities to established and up-and-coming black, Asian and ethnically erse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. The orchestra made its highly acclaimed Proms debut in 2017.She said if the BBC did not axe Rule Britannia, she would be mortified. “I will feel invisible with my people and our history. If the BBC are talking about Black Lives Matter and their support for the movement, how could you possibly have Rule Britannia as the last concert – in any concert?”Plans are yet to be finalised for the concert on 12 September. The BBC said in a statement: “We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences.“We have announced that conductor Dalia Stasevska, soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra will perform at the Last Night of the Proms this year.”Rule Britannia and Land of Hope of Glory were among the “crudely jingoistic texts” singled out for criticism by the classical music critic Richard Morrison in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month. He wrote that given the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic, “there will never be a better moment to drop that toe-curling, embarrassing, anachronistic farrago of nationalistic songs that concludes the Last Night of the Proms.”He added: “In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical 18th-century words, with or without irony.”Morrison’s column led to a backlash, with the Conservative MP Philip Davies dismissing it as “extremist, virtue-signalling views”. News that the future of the anthems was now under debate was criticised as unpatriotic by several prominent pro-Brexit campaigners, including Nigel Farage.The Proms presenter Josie d’Arby told the Times: “This year everyone is thinking about racial equality. The Proms has always done that but … it is upping it out of respect for the current climate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e901be841c4d95df745c4bb1c5705f9e99ea95b2/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39258126b94da561121fbd971beed827 1440w","title":"my blue passport has arrived and with it a crushing new sense of our brexit nightmare","story":"We definitely are not in the EU any more.

Obviously on some subconscious level, I thought it was all a dream, or a joke.The colour, meanwhile, is not the nostalgia kick you might have hoped for, if that was your thing, since it genuinely is blue, while the pre-EU ones looked more like black. This somehow says it all about the Brexit project, that it would fight to the death over a principle that was trivial and wrong. Three flowers and a shamrock are embossed on the back, for poetry I suppose, except the daffodil could be any flower, and the overall effect is of someone finding free graphics on the internet for a superbly boring PowerPoint presentation.Yet by far the worst thing about it was my own photo, as ever, contriving to look meaner and more like Myra Hindley than the last, which was itself the worst picture I had ever taken. Remarkably, and powerfully, this lifted my spirits. Some things never change. Every passport has a worse photo than the last – even, mysteriously, one you lost after only six months. But everything else can change, and who knows, by 2030, the blue years could be over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7099a789ead1e286965b1389bfd4a8b1ce2f7224/0_49_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d21977165b6d3517c0a9d717d4197378","title":"sophia popov holds her nerve and lands first major with the womens open","story":"For Sophia Popov a little piece of history alongside a $675,000 (£515,000) cheque. Victory in the Women’s Open – ultimately so comfortable the scale of her underdog status was easily forgotten – means the 27-year-old becomes the first German to claim a major title on British soil.In the first staging of this championship on the famed Ayrshire links, Popov joins a stellar list – Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson et al – of iconic Troon major winners. Popov was in floods of tears even before tapping in for victory on the 72nd green.That scene only emphasised earlier battles and a life-changing performance. Moments later she walked towards the clubhouse with champagne bottle in hand even golf’s blazer brigade had to nod in approval.This seemed the most unlikely of outcomes. Popov was chasing success in 54-hole competitions on the Cactus Tour in the middle of this year. The very name seems to perfectly articulate that level. She began this week as the world No 304 and without any apparent major credentials whatsoever. She did not even have status on the LPGA Tour. Now, Popov can pick and choose where to play.She started day four holding a three-stroke lead, a supposedly dicey situation for a player unaccustomed to challenging for titles. Popov’s position never looked under serious threat. Her closing 68 meant a two-stroke success, at seven under par overall. Jasmine Suwannapura, the Thai player who like Tiger Woods has rebounded from career-saving back surgery, finished second.“This feels amazing,” said Popov. “There has been a lot of work, there have been a lot of struggles. I knew I was capable, I just had a lot of obstacles in my way. The Women’s Open to me was a bonus. I got here on Tuesday, I knew my game was in good shape and anything was possible. I just took that belief into every round but I never expected this.”If Popov was, quite understandably, never counting on victory, one hole emphasised what was meant to be. Her drive at the 15th appeared destined for one of the treacherous fairway bunkers, with the ball instead scuttling into adjacent rough. Her subsequent iron shot, from an uphill lie, finished 20ft from the hole. With the birdie putt duly converted, she led by four.Only Suwannapura belatedly threatened to spoil the party, thanks to a superb birdie from 40ft on the 16th. Popov responded with another one of her own at the same hole. Suwannapura swung again, collecting another shot at the par-three 17th. Yet the leader knew only a disastrous finish would cost her the first women’s major of 2020. There was no such implosion, nor any suggestion of one. Minjee Lee finished third, at three under.The Sunday scene was perfect. Gone were the gusts that affected the first two rounds, with the coast as close as seemed possible to flat calm.Popov is due immense credit for this nerveless win but one wonders how the elements may have disrupted the mindset of one so unaccustomed to jousting for the top titles. She made bogey from sand at the first but bounced back with three birdies in her next five holes.“I used to be a player who didn’t like to lead so this was a new position,” she said. “I just had belief going into this round. I told myself I was capable of birdies on every hole.”Lydia Ko stood with arms aloft on the 18th green after converting a lengthy putt for par. The celebrations embodied her final day. At three over, the re-emerging New Zealander finished with a share of 14th. Better – much better – is surely to come from the two-times major winner. It would be wise to keep an eye on her during the remainder of this year.So too Inbee Park, whose 66 meant fourth place. “It’s my husband’s first week at a major championship,” she said. “Posting a top-10 finish for him is a really nice thing to do.” Park, Lee, Suwannapura and Popov were the only players to break par.This was a highly successful event and justified the persistence of the R\u0026ampA in staging it. Pace of play, the scourge of golf in recent times, was not an issue at all.Troon responded magnificently at a juncture where a major for the female game had never carried such value. The highest prize of all belongs to Popov. Cactus Tour no more. Eat your heart out, Bernhard Langer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95cc2f4859841c9494073780f99c14bea40347e3/0_265_5803_3479/master/5803.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=df2211c52795c6b97262516c3365a4ca","title":"edinburgh unlocked review penguin audiobook comics comedy festival","story":"Audiobook, available onlinePenguin’s fine pandemic audio festival delivers hours of laughs from comics including Jordan Brookes, Glamrou, Mo Amar, Michelle de Swarte and Sheeps‘I’m just imagining a world in which, I’m going to the fringe, the highlight of my year, it’s so communal and exciting, and then – Oh sorry, that’s not happening, what you’ve got instead is some sketches recorded in an audiobook format instead of the best arts festival in the world.” So begins the contribution of sketch troupe Sheeps to Penguin’s audiobook Edinburgh Unlocked. They’re recording this in early March 2020 (so the joke goes), when such a fate is absolutely “not worth thinking about!”It wasn’t – but is it now? A “fringe-inspired audio comedy festival”, Edinburgh Unlocked can now be enjoyed in lieu of this year’s missing carnival in the Scottish capital. And, even granting Sheeps’ point that it can’t begin to substitute for the real thing, it really is enjoyable. Props to the curators: the lineup is packed with acts I’d have been first in line to see at the in-real-life #Edfringe. Newcomers Chloe Petts and Mo Omar, double-acts Shelf and Anna and Helen, big-hitters Jordan Brookes and John Kearns: it’s a bill that steers far from the middle-of-the-road towards comedy’s most creative talents.In some cases, we get excerpts of the shows we might have encountered in Edinburgh. Drag queen Glamrou’s remarkable autobiographical set combines cross-cultural material (they are a non-binary, a queer Iraqi Muslim who went to an all-boys boarding school in the UK) with outrageous – and sacrilegious – sex comedy. Glamrou has clearly lived a life of extremes, so the story stays extraordinary even when the humour isn’t. It has all the hallmarks, in other words, of a classic Edinburgh debut, declaring “This is me!” so eye-catchingly the rookie weaknesses are easy to ignore.I could say the same about ex-model turned comic Michelle de Swarte’s 20 minutes, which address “the benefits of being fit as fuck” – which no one, she claims, ever speaks honestly about. Sure enough, this feels like a fresh perspective, as De Swarte recounts her years of sailing through life, blithe in the advantages beauty confers – and cuts through the cant often uttered on this subject. It’s as much TED Talk as comedy – although, who knows, it might (as might Glamrou’s show) come gloriously alive in person.Elsewhere, there’s more bespoke material. Drawing on the claim that Shakespeare wrote King Lear during a pandemic, Ivo Graham parallels that tragedy with his own unheroic lockdown experience. It’s urbane and self-mocking, and much fun is had domesticating Shakespeare’s blasted-heath original, as the character of the Earl of Kent is compared to Mrs Doubtfire, and tennis player Kyle Edmund fingered as proof that all Edmunds are “rotters”. Comedy award champ Jordan Brookes offers a binaural “guided meditation” that goes dark and self-reflexive, as we journey from the beach of tranquillity past the goblins of repressed trauma to a nasty encounter with some penis-shaped cars."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9869d06b77bb8c5c87e5e9a75c4fb2ad1cc19f32/21_0_5368_3223/master/5368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3481514b26043ac8482a25222b257867","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

After the budget was delayed by three inconclusive elections the government has been using last year’s plan throughout 2020.With the coronavirus pandemic sparking an economic crisis, the government has announced additional financial measures such as cash handouts to Israelis, but some experts say such an approach is unsustainable.“We’ve never had such a concerning situation,” said Daphna Aviram-Nitzan from the Israel Democracy Institute, who argued that passing a budget was vital for stimulating growth.“The government must start to lead the way and start to show that they know what to do,” said Aviram-Nitzan, who heads the institute’s governance and economy centre. “It’s the minimum that they should give to the business sector,” she said, before Netanyahu announced the compromise.The coalition deal clinched by Netanyahu and Gantz included a two-year budget but the prime minister had been pushing for a one-year budget for 2020 alone.Netanyahu’s critics had accused him of wanting Monday’s deadline to be missed so he could tear up the agreement under which Gantz will take over as prime minister late next year.Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, held talks with party leaders on Thursday and told them Israelis “feel cheated and suspicious” after three elections in less than a year. “The president stressed that it is inconceivable that the question of approving the budget will lead to a fourth round of elections,” Rivlin’s office said.Netanyahu’s decision paves the way for lawmakers to approve the three-month delay to agree a budget, although the threat of polls could return as the new deadline approaches.A poll published earlier this week showed Likud would be the frontrunner in elections, picking up 29 seats compared with the 36 it won in March. Blue and White would pick up just nine seats, according to the Ma’ariv newspaper poll, down from 33, after lawmakers abandoned the party once Gantz joined the coalition.Netanyahu is emphasising the deal reached with the United Arab Emirates earlier this month, but his foreign policy success cannot mask discontent among the electorate about his recent handling of the pandemic.Thousands of Israelis protested outside the prime minister’s Jerusalem residence on Saturday evening, the latest in weeks of demonstrations. Israelis are also rallying against political corruption, after Netanyahu became the first sitting prime minister to go on trial for graft in May.But despite calls for the prime minister to step down, many Israelis will be relieved that the prospect of a fresh poll has been ruled out for now.“The public does not want another election,” said Scheindlin. “It’s madness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc44d61d4ec85814b0a54cc9224e3591f3565202/2_0_4162_2500/master/4162.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8389800086abc5b26fd6c0dd9edffb55","title":"ardern says 2020 has been frankly terrible as auckland lockdown extended","story":"Masks made mandatory on public transport across New Zealand as coronavirus cases continue to riseNew Zealand’s biggest city will remain in lockdown until midnight on Sunday, the extra four days necessitated by the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said.A total of 101 people have been infected by the outbreak in south Auckland, making it the largest cluster in New Zealand.Ardern said the cluster would have been significantly bigger if level three restrictions had not been imposed so quickly, as people had become infected at churches, shopping centres and on public buses.“If it weren’t for level three, this cluster would be exponential, of that I have no doubt,” she said on Monday.“This is a contained cluster. But it is our biggest one. And that means the tail will be long, and the cases will keep coming for a while to come.”Ardern also announced that from Monday masks on public transport would be mandatory country-wide, although some, such as those with severe breathing difficulties, would be exempt.Speaking to New Zealanders who have been demoralised by the second wave of the virus after 102 days of being Covid-free, Ardern acknowledged that 2020 had been exceptionally hard.“If it feels hard – that’s because it has been,” she said. “But let’s also remember, in a world where 2020 has frankly been terrible, we are strong, we have been kind, and we are doing really well.”The source of the outbreak is unidentified, and health authorities say it may never be known.Epidemiological experts welcomed the lockdown extension and said it was the best way to eliminate the virus again.“There are almost certainly still active, unidentified cases in the community with the potential to spark new outbreaks if we relax too soon,” said Prof Michael Plank of Te Pūnaha Matatini.“The cases we have seen as a result of contacts between strangers on bus journeys are an example of how quickly this outbreak could spread. “Provided the recent trend of cases continues, the extra four days at level three will give us a better chance of containing this cluster. We should also remember there is still a risk of the outbreak spreading outside Auckland.”Associate Prof Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist and public health communicator from the University of Auckland, agreed.“This is a pragmatic decision to ensure the current cluster is fully contained,” she said. “The last thing we want is to miss some cases that then turn into further community transmission.”However, resistance to the lockdown is growing in Auckland. Dozens of people joined an anti-lockdown protest in the city at the weekend, saying their rights were being breached.There are also daily reports that Aucklanders are failing to adhere to the lockdown rules as strictly as they did the first time.Dr Dougal Sutherland, a clinical psychologist at Victoria University of Wellington, said the lockdown extension would be “disheartening” for many.“Whereas the first lockdown was accompanied by an increase in anxiety for some, the recent return to level three seemed to bring with it a collective downturn in mood,” he said.“The government announcement today could further erode our collective sense of hope.”Auckland’s mayor, Phil Goff, urged Aucklanders to stay calm and stay the course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2dfdac0d8973ae0f59564b4fb7cbeb59beea9ca/0_136_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bb9ef23ac726104a164a32278ffa7262","title":"japan running out of credit card numbers amid online shopping boom","story":"Covid and a campaign to encourage cashless payments prompts credit card companies to consider adding 17th digit Japan is running out of credit card numbers amid a surge in online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic.The country’s credit card companies are struggling to come up with original 16-digit numbers as consumers eschew regular shop visits and opt for plastic over hard cash, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported.Most of Japan’s 280 credit card companies issue cards with 16 digits so they can partner with international firms such as Visa and Mastercard.While the first six digits denote the country, brand and other information, the remaining 10, which include the account number and type of account, are decided by the credit card issuer.Credit card companies have warned that the boost in card issuances will result in a shortage of combinations from the seventh-digit onwards, the newspaper said.Credit card use is expected to continue rising as Japan attempts to end its addiction to cash, with many consumers, especially older people, happy to carry around large quantities of notes.The most obvious solution to the combination conundrum would be to add an extra digit to credit card numbers, but the reform, which would involve advance trials to prevent forgery, could leave the industry with a bill running into billions of yen that it is reluctant to pass on to consumers.“Although we want to do everything possible to avoid increasing the number of digits, I think that ultimately, our only choice is to carry the financial burden ourselves,” a credit card company executive told the Mainichi.Even if credit card firms agree that an additional digit is the best solution, they will have to decide whether to update almost 300 million 16-digit cards already in circulation or allow them to co-exist with new cards, the paper said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1199f987999f45a5f91b7e208570ac216edc2bb7/0_91_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994f279ec85dec726d53140b911cb738","title":"with a word of tamil kamala harris boosts her fanbase in india","story":"Pride in US VP candidate particularly strong in Tamil Nadu village where her grandfather was bornAs a child wandering between the legs of the aunts, uncles and family friends who filled her grandparents’ apartment in Chennai, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a young Kamala Harris grew used to being addressed in Tamil.It was the main language spoken by her grandmother, who had only fragmented English, and over the years of Harris’s childhood trips from California to Chennai – which back then was called Madras – to visit her mother’s side of the family, she slowly learned to understand, if not speak, the mother tongue of her Indian relatives.Standing at the Democratic convention podium last week accepting her historic nomination for US vice-president, Harris made a passing but significant nod to this aspect of her heritage. She said her mother had “raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage”, adding: “Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis.”Harris is the first candidate of Indian descent to be on a US presidential ticket, and her use of chithi, the Tamil term of endearment meaning “auntie”, sent reverberations through south Asian households in the US and also those watching 8,000 miles away in India.“I literally have tears in my eyes,” tweeted the model and chef Padma Lakshmi, who like Harris’s mother was born in Chennai and moved to the US. “Kamala Harris just said ‘chithis’ which means auntie. My heart is so full right now.”Harris’s use of Tamil in her speech has boosted her growing fanbase in India, particularly in the tiny eastern Tamil Nadu village of Painganadu where her grandfather PV Gopalan was born in 1911 and which Harris visited once as a child with her grandmother.In the past week posters have appeared all over the village, emblazoned with Harris’s face and bearing slogans expressing local pride, wishing her good luck and describing her as “lion-hearted”.Bharathi Selvam, 27, whose grandfather knew Harris’s grandfather, was among those in Painganadu who organised for the posters to be hung up in the village tea shop and on every lane. “It is a very proud moment for us,” he said. “We have all become very active, everyone has put up signs supporting her and started reading about American politics. We have all been offering prayers for her, so I am sure she will win.”Harris’s Indian side of the family still send financial donations to the Dharma Shastra temple in the village, and her name, alongside those of her relatives, is carved into the temple wall. The temple’s administrator SV Ramanam, 71, said Harris’s aunt Sarala Gopalan had asked him to perform a small prayer ritual to offer good luck for her niece. “The villagers are very elated at this news,” said Ramanam.Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, left India aged 19 after being offered a part-funded PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. According to Harris and her Indian relatives, Shyamala ensured that her two daughters did not lose touch with their Indian heritage despite growing up in America.Every few years Shyamala, who worked as a cancer research scientist and was also a renowned singer of traditional Carnatic music, would bring her daughters to Chennai to visit her retired grandparents, and Harris would take formative walks with her grandfather along the beach. Harris was not able to come back to India for the funeral of her grandfather, who died suddenly in 1999, but she returned to Chennai beach to scatter the ashes of her mother, who died of cancer in 2009.In a speech last week at a “South Asians for Biden” event, Harris spoke of her times in Chennai. “Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry,” she recalled. “And of course, she always wanted to instil in us a love of good idli.”Harris’s bonds with the Indian side of her family have remained tight and they all flew out to Washington for her inauguration as a senator in 2017.“We are naturally very proud,” said Harris’s uncle G Balachandran, 79, who lives in Delhi. “This has brought great happiness to us all in her family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5d85c387271e982230b43d50578ed0f73ef557/0_159_2897_1739/master/2897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9800722b5f057419879b9a2c6437c067","title":"coronavirus live news send children to school uk pm urges france sees highest cases since may","story":"South Korea tightens restrictions Trump authorises plasma treatment amid attacks on FDA send children to school, UK PM urgesThe FTSE 100 jumped on Monday, tracking Asian markets as U.S. regulators authorised a Covid-19 treatment over the weekend, while AstraZeneca rose on a report the US government was considering fast-tracking its experimental vaccine.

Commuters are reliable, law-abiding creatures of habit, cogs in a greater machine I am doing what I am told.Before Covid-19, in the rush-hour, you would often have to ruck and maul just to get on to a train. Today, there are only three people, masked and well-distanced, in the carriage. It does not get much busier as the journey continues. A couple more at Willesden Green, once a rural area with a few grand houses – until about 1870, when the builders moved in and began turning it into a working-class suburb for a new breed of commuter:A lighter story now from Reuters: For Zeng Sheng, the manager at Shanghai Maiyi Arts, this autumn should have been a boon for business: with the US presidential election, demand for the centre’s wax replicas of Donald Trump should have been off the charts. Instead, the spread of the coronavirus has halted new orders and stalled overseas travel, including to and from the US. He is now holding off on producing a replica of Joe Biden.Located in the outskirts of Shanghai, about an hour’s drive from the city centre, its exhibition hall also doubles as makeshift museum, where guests can pose next to replicas of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, martial arts star Jackie Chan, and others.Zeng says that by 2019, the company was shipping up to 700 figures annually to customers, with about one-third going overseas.The virus, however, hit orders twice: first in China, when factories and tourist sites closed, and then overseas. Business remains about two-thirds its normal size, Zeng says.The full story now in China administering a coronavirus vaccine candidate to selected groups of key workers – since July. Zheng Zhongei, the head of the National Health Commission’s science and technology centre, told state media organisation CCTV on Sunday the government had authorised “emergency use” of a Sars-Cov-2 vaccine for workers including health workers and border officials.The country has gone seven days without reporting a locally transmitted case, and border workers are considered to be in a high-risk category, said Zheng, who leads the vaccination development taskforce.It appears to be the first confirmation of vaccine use by China outside clinical trials: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has returned from hospital, making brief remarks following a second hospital visit that has stoked concern about his health.Abe said he wants to do everything to maintain his health and do his utmost at his job. Japan’s longest-serving Prime Minister has been the target of deepening speculation that he may resign due to his health issues. On Monday he visited a Tokyo hospital for the second time within days.He was speaking to reporters after returning to his official residence from the hospital.Streaming services such as Netflix are taking advantage of the global shortage of new television programmes to outbid British channels for new shows, forcing traditional broadcasters to find new ways to fill schedules in the coming years.Although television audiences rose sharply during the coronavirus lockdown, the near-global production shutdown has created a looming shortage of new material to show to viewers in the coming months. At the same time Britain’s commercial television channels are dealing with the collapse in the advertising market caused by the recession, leaving subscription streaming services able to swoop in and spend big on new commissions to maintain their growth: Japan is running out of credit card numbers amid a surge in online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic.The country’s credit card companies are struggling to come up with original 16-digit numbers as consumers eschew regular shop visits and opt for plastic over hard cash, the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported.

The global death toll is nearing 810,000. Currently it stands at 807,830. Here are the ten worst-affected countries in terms of number of cases: Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, visited a Tokyo hospital on Monday for a second time within days, stoking concern about his ability to stay on as leader due to health issues and fatigue from tackling the coronavirus pandemic.Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Abe was at the hospital for the follow-up of a medical check a week ago when his examination lasted 7-12 hours, fuelling worries about his health.But major broadcaster Nippon TV said Abe was being treated for a chronic illness rather than a check-up, citing multiple unidentified government and ruling party sources. It added that Abe was scheduled to go to his office in the afternoon.“I was informed that he’s getting an additional exam after last week’s exam,” Suga, who is also the chief cabinet secretary and is seen as one of the main contenders for Abe’s job, told a regular news conference.“The premier himself said the other day that he wanted to return to work.”A return to the old ways...In Papua New Guinea, the Covid-19 lockdowns have led to a shortage of food in stores, and a lack of cash. In response, many of the archipelago nation’s old ways are returning.

File photograph: iStockWe had a couple of complaints about insurance – both car and travel. Just more than five weeks ago Elaine Donnelly was involved in “a very minor incident where my car door hit another car door in a car park. A scuff mark existed which disappeared after polishing with a wet finger.” What happened next highlights much of what is wrong with the insurance industry in Ireland. “The other driver became irate and took a photo of my insurance details. I photographed the scuff mark on the other car, and there was no damage to my car,” she says. “I contacted my insurer to inform them, in case of a fraudulent claim. No claim has been made to date by the other driver. Indeed, if one were to be made, my excess of €300 would more than cover the cost.”Auto pilotMeanwhile, Gerald Duffy asked us to “give a big shoutout to VHI travel insurance”, but before the company gets out the champagne to celebrate some good news, it should probably know that he said that with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. He was prompted to mail us after getting an email confirming that his annual VHI travel insurance would auto-renew at the end of the month and the cost would be automatically deducted from his credit card.“I had to phone VHI and cancel, and they even then tried to put me off, telling me that I would have access to exclusive airport lounges etc,” he writes. “A friend of mine only discovered his VHI travel insurance renewed in April at the height of travel restrictions when he looked at his Visa bill. Irate, he phoned them up and got a refund. Anyway, can you give a big shoutout to VHI travel, and their auto travel insurance renewal policies. ‘We are all in this together’, except of course VHI, who are in this for the profits.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockThe HSE is planning to leave spare testing capacity within its weekly limit of 100,000 Covid-19 tests for cases in schools and will, if necessary, reduce mass testing in high-risk settings.Serial testing is being carried out of staff at nursing homes and at meat processing and food production plants in Kildare, Laois and Offaly. Testing has started at direct provision centres.Health officials plan to leave spare capacity available over the coming weeks as schools reopen to ensure there is sufficient testing to be able to respond to possible outbreaks in schools.Sources said serial testing to understand the spread of the disease through asymptomatic transmission would be reduced to free up additional capacity for cases in schools and priority would be given to serial testing of symptomatic or vulnerable people in congregated settings.Health officials tested 13,000 people last Friday, a record since the coronavirus pandemic began in March and 2,000 tests short of the daily limit. It is expected a weekly record of tests will be reached this week.Under plans being devised by State officials schools would not be immediately closed in the event of Covid-19 outbreaks but would be investigated to assess reasons for outbreaks.The Department of Education and the HSE are working on actions that they would take to investigate clusters of infections that emerge in inidual schools following their reopening this week after being closed since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Risk assessmentThe framework is designed around a risk assessment by public health officials to examine contacts within schools to determine whether inidual teachers or classes had contact in buildings, corridors or playgrounds outside “pods” of students and class “bubbles” and whether infections were limited to certain circumstances and buildings specific to inidual schools.The measures are aimed at avoiding school closures in the event of outbreaks, so clusters of infections are to be investigated on a case-by-case basis.Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group advising Government on Covid-19, acknowledged the anxiety among parents and teachers around schools reopening but said there was little evidence to show schools were major sites of transmission.Homes were “a much more intimate and high-contact setting than even a school,” he said.A further 61 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in the Republic on Sunday, with no further deaths. This brings total cases of the disease in the State to 27,969. Some 1,777 people have died.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Motorcyclist (17) dies following collision with bus in Finglas, DublinWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Nora Quoirin disappeared from family\u0026rsquos cottage at Dusun eco-resort in August 2019Pricewatch readers\u0026rsquo queries: Meanwhile, VHI is in firing line over travel insurance policiesYour consumer queries answeredTusla cannot \u0026lsquoprovide assurance\u0026rsquo over safety of children on waiting lists \u0026ndash auditCo Kildare GP describes wider long-term effects of Covid-19HSE will reduce mass testing if necessary to free up capacity for school outbreaksOPW warns of major financial exposure over delay in move from Harcourt Square officesPlan for drink containers would result in loss of 1.2m kerbside collection pointsNo Irish judge has ever been formally unseated from their positionIf Ursula von der Leyen accepts his report, Government will not seek his resignationSupport, not sympathy urgently needed for sector, says Vintners\u0026rsquo Federation of IrelandOnline form will facilitate \u0026lsquoan enhanced system of engagements\u0026rsquo says Minister for HealthSupreme Court judge\u0026rsquos actions will test \u0026lsquomaintenance of standards\u0026rsquo across public lifeTwo customers try to cancel their contracts with Eir, but find getting a response next to impossibleMan arrested and being detained after incident in ClontarfTwo others appeared in court on Saturday charged with directing terrorismTeenager\u0026rsquos body was found about 2km from the Dusun resort in MalaysiaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336912.1598194872!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how three irish exporters are facing the prospect of a hard brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMartin McVicar, co-founder and CEO CombiLift in the Monaghan factory. ‘We have controls in place.’ Photograph: Philip FitzpatrickExporters are turning their attention to the next looming challenge: the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union’s single market and customs union on January 1st without a trade deal.And while Covid-19 continues to dominate the news and adversely affect business, some companies are optimistic that they are prepared as best they can be for the consequences of a hard Brexit.Silverhill Foods of Emyvale in Co Monaghan has an annual turnover of more than €30 million with 70 per cent of the company’s weekly output of 80,000 ducks exported to 27 countries – 40 per cent of them to Chinese restaurants in the UK. The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File image: Dara Mac DónaillThe Phil Hogan was stopped by a garda while in Kildare, on route from Kilkenny to Clifden, for using his mobile phone while driving.Mr Hogan’s spokesman said he was cautioned and he did not receive penalty points.Earlier on Sunday, Mr Hogan’s spokesman said the Commissioner will not be resigning from his position, as controversy continued over his attendance at this week’s Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Mr Hogan said he wished to apologise “fully and unreservedly” for attending the event along with more than 80 people.A Garda investigation is underway into the event, which took place just a day after the Government had decided to further limit the size of indoor gatherings under Covid-19 regulations to combat the spread of the virus.In a further development on Sunday, the golf society’s president Donie Cassidy has resigned as vice president of Fianna Fáil.The former TD and senator was among those involved in organising the event and made a speech at it.In his statement earlier on Sunday, Mr Hogan said: “I want, in particular, to apologise to the wonderful healthcare workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to combat Covid-19 and all people who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry.“I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offense caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this.“I acknowledge that the issue is far bigger than compliance with rules and regulations and adherence to legalities and procedures. All of us must display solidarity as we try to stamp out this common plague.“I thus offer this fulsome and profound apology, at this difficult time for all people, as the world as a whole combats Covid-19.“I spoke to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste yesterday and I have listened carefully to their views, which I respect. I have been reporting to the President of the European Commission on all these matters in recent days.”A spokesperson confirmed in a statement to The  that Mr Hogan would not be resigning.Tánaiste and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar\u0026nbsptold RTÉ’s This Week programme that Mr Hogan’s apology on Sunday for attending the dinner in breach of public health guidelines had helped the situation.“It would have been better if it had come sooner but it definitely helps,” he said.“We need to make it clear to Commissioner Hogan and to the Irish people that we don’t condone his actions we are not accountable for them we are not going to defend them at all. It is up to him to account for his actions, to explain them and to satisfy people,” said Mr Varadkar.‘Consider his position’On Saturday Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Mr Varadkar asked Mr Hogan to “consider his position” as EU Commissioner after attending the event.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action,” a Government spokesperson said on Saturday.Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade remains in doubt and the intervention on Saturday by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance at the golf dinner.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office.On Sunday, Labour leader Alan Kelly urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to “inform” Ms Von der Leyen “that they no longer have confidence” in Mr Hogan and that he should resign.Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Event durationMeanwhile, the Oireachtas Golf Society is coming under further pressure to disclose the length of time more than 80 people were gathered at the dinner.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.One of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches, including from society captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish and Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.One attendee couldn’t recall what time people left the function room, saying some stayed on to talk afterwards before everyone “scattered”.“It’s impossible to say, I wasn’t conscious of time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.‘Multiple breaches’Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald told The  she was concerned “to hear reports of multiple breaches of public health guidelines” at the event.“We know the number of attendees exceeded the limit, but it has now been alleged that the event also lasted far longer than the time limit permitted,” she said.“The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Ms McDonald said the Irish public was “understandably concerned about what happened and this drip feed of information and allegations risks undermining confidence in the public health guidelines at this critical time in the fight against Covid-19”.Some attendees stayed at rooms in the hotel where the dinner took place and others stayed in at least two other hotels in the town. Some remained on at the hotel lounge in the lobby afterwards.“We were assured everything was in order,” one said.“It was a cock up anyway, with the benefit of hindsight. The dinner shouldn’t have taken place.”As well as the more than 80 attendees, there was “a pile” of staff, with one or two waiters assigned to each table, according to one of the diners.Restrictions state staff should be included when calculating maximum numbers, meaning the gathering was several multiples of the latest allowed number of six for indoor gatherings, and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations.All-expenses tripThe scandal is not the first time the Oireachtas Golf Society has courted controversy.In the summer of 2010, the society went on an all-expenses paid trip to Turkey for official celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the Turkish parliament, which had organised a golf tournament for parliamentarians from around the globe.Among those travelling were Mr Cassidy, Mr Grealish and then Carlow Kilkenny TD Mr Hogan.Then leader of the Seanad Mr Cassidy was forced to deny claims on his return that he had refused to reopen the Upper House alongside the Dáil the same week because he and his golfing colleagues were staying at the five star Sueno Hotels Golf Belek resort in the popular coastal resort Antalya.“I gave up my whole bloody weekend in the name of Ireland,” he said of his trip to Turkey at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that

president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"new zealands lust lockdown latest example vapid political virtue","story":"Progressive mythology always demands a socialist valhalla a nation to be idealised and held as up an inspiration. For years, Scandinavia, and particularly Sweden, played this role. The stereotype was never entirely accurate Scandinavian social democracy is a far cry from full-throated socialism, yet it remained influential.In the face of the pandemic, however, the tables have turned now it is the libertarian Right who are lining up to applaud Swedish exceptionalism, while progressives liken their controversial strategy to a form of eugenics. With Sweden consigned to the naughty step, the Left needs a new country to fetishise, and they have alighted on New Zealand.This was underway long before the virus arrived, thanks to NZ’s intoxicating combination of centre-left politics and a charismatic, young and importantly, female, leader: Jacinda Ardern. Her decisive leadership following the mass shooting in Christchurch propelled the New Zealand PM to global prominence, and she has since enjoyed fawning media coverage surpassing even the high water-mark of Trudeau-mania.The Left applauded NZ’s “wellbeing budget”, emphasising citizens’ happiness over GDP growth, and cheered when Ardern brought her baby into the UN assembly hall. Their zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been especially influential. A group of weak-minded MPs and peers are currently urging our own Government to pursue a similar aim of total eradication.We should be under no illusion - this is no model for New Zealand to follow, let alone a sophisticated global economy like ours. NZ may have contained the virus, for now at least, registering the lowest mortality rates in the OECD, but it has taken genuinely draconian policies and great economic pain to get there. The Ardern administration is eliminating rights on a scale more reminiscent of authoritarian China than a Western liberal democracy.Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the government announced a grand total of four new cases in the capital. GDP has taken its biggest slide in three decades. A total ban on foreign arrivals has endured for months, with catastrophic results for tourism, directly employing 8.4 per cent of the workforce. New Zealanders returning from abroad must pay for the privilege of isolating in military-guarded facilities, to the tune of more than £1,500 per head. One man recently received a six-week jail sentence for hugging a friend quarantining in a detention centre.The NZ experience should serve as a cautionary tale about the normalisation of overreach. Though the country has not recorded a single covid death since May, the government decided to postpone the Autumn elections following the small-scale outbreak this month. Progressives, so alert to the subversion of democracy in the USA, had little to say about this extraordinary over-reaction.An elimination strategy has made them hostages to fortune with precedence established, it will be politically toxic to change course. Ardern has ridden high in the polls so far, but if such disruption continues, public appetite for keeping the country virus-free at any cost will surely wane, and the recent outbreak, despite NZ’s geographic isolation and its draconian policy response, suggests no country can postpone the inevitable.The implications of New Zealand’s autarchy go beyond its shores as well. Tourism accounts for a third of jobs in Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu and two thirds of their visitors come from Australia and New Zealand. Yet amid mounting poverty and unemployment, island leaders’ pleadings for air bridges seem barely to have registered with an administration myopically focused on elimination. In seeking to be kind, the Ardern administration has ended up being very cruel indeed.Enthusiasts for this model imply that elimination, like the happiness budget, and like Ardern herself, puts people above the callous vicissitudes of the balance sheet. As we are increasingly finding, the two cannot be so easily disentangled. Excessively harsh lockdowns have become a form of international virtue-signalling something only wealthy nations can afford, but which promises catastrophe for the world’s poorest.Before the recent spike, commentators lauded Ardern as being “on course to eradicate the virus completely.” The ambition was childish and hubristic in the extreme. Until the planet reaches a state of elimination, New Zealand will have to stay in indefinite isolation, with domestic lock-downs a likely fixture of life, perhaps for years to come. The economy cannot bear this for long. Nor can the people.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc can nations voice brexit says director general","story":"Britain needs the BBC more than ever to promote the country’s “voice and values” after Brexit, Lord Hall will claim on Monday. In his final speech as director-general, he will appeal to the government to “unleash the full global potential of the BBC” as the UK forges a new relationship with the world.The BBC needs more taxpayers’ money to combat a “second pandemic” of fake news spread by Russia and China, he will claim.During his virtual address at Edinburgh Television Festival, Lord Hall will attempt to set out his legacy as BBC director-general after seven years in the job. Tim Davie, a senior BBC executive, will replace him next month.“My goal, when I arrived at the BBC, was to double our global audience to reach 500 million people by 2022 – our centenary year,” Lord Hall will say.“With two years to go, we are today reaching 468 million people each week.“We have plans in place to double that ambition – to reach a global audience of one billion people by the end of the decade. But it needs extra investment from government and that bid is with them right now.”A BBC source said Lord Hall was referring to a bid for £100 million in government funding to bolster the World Service in countries including Russia and China.“This is about much more than protecting integrity in news, critical as that is,” Lord Hall will say during a virtual address.“It’s also about helping to protect our democratic integrity, and fostering unity and cohesion.“The forces of disinformation and social media tend to feed on fracture and drive polarisation. They’re often specifically designed to exploit ision for commercial or political gain to unsettle societies or undermine democracy.”His intervention comes amid a row with ministers after the BBC decided to force millions of over-75s to pay the licence fee. But Lord Hall urged the government to back the BBC as a diplomatic weapon as the UK seeks new trade after Brexit.He will cite research claiming an “exceptionally high correlation” between countries where people are aware of the BBC and places where people think positively of Britain.“No one can do more to carry Britain’s voice and values to the world. This could hardly be more important as Britain sets out to forge a new relationship with the world, based on an ambitious vision of ‘Global Britain’, he will say.“Success will mean drawing on all our considerable international assets. And that means unleashing the full global potential of the BBC.“More and more, in the fake news world, truth is a priceless commodity in our societies.“So let’s not forget that, in the BBC, the UK has a remarkable asset: the pre-eminent provider to the world of facts you can trust.”Lord Hall will suggest the BBC has a crucial role play in “bringing the country together” as it battles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The disease has “brutally exposed fault lines of deprivation and demography”, he will say, adding “recession may well fan that anger and unfairness still further”.In recent years the BBC has been confronted with the the rise of digital streaming services such as Netflix as younger people turn away from traditional television to on-demand shows. Two years ago the corporation admitted that for the first time young people are spending more time watching Netflix than all of its BBC TV services each week.But Lord Hall will claim that he has left the BBC well placed to fight its commercial rivals, with digital services such as iPlayer making up for lost ground.“History is littered – not just in media, but across many sectors – with companies and organisations that failed to adapt to the digital world. Many great names have fallen,” he is expected to say. “The BBC isn’t one of them. We have made the pivot to a new world. We’re all set to compete with the very best in the global digital age.”Lord Hall’s tenure has been marked by bitter rows with his own female staff over equal pay. Earlier this year the broadcaster Carrie Gracie won a landmark discrimination case against the corporation over claims she had been paid less than her male colleagues. Further legal claims are expected to follow.In his farewell speech, Lord Hall will urge the BBC to put ersity at the heart of its recruitment strategy.“We need to attract people who are different, who have different ideas about what matters, who draw on different experiences, who come from different backgrounds,” he will say. “That for me is the argument for greater ersity. It’s about creativity – promoting talent to deliver erse thinking.  And that in turn brings about great programmes that make sense of and reflect the world in which we live. And we have got to be better at that than anyone else.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus has confirmed teenage angst abolished joy","story":"There are two ways of looking at youth. One is that you’re never more alive, with all those hormones coursing through you, doing everything for the first time, and that your subsequent life is a whittling away until you end up shedding bitter tears looking at photographs of your childhood sweetheart on Facebook.The other is that you’re just a shadow of your future self, running with the crowd and scared to stand out and that, as David Bowie said, “Aging is an extraordinary process where you become the person you always should have been.”One thing’s for sure in Western culture, we see “teenage” as a time when, as the song says, we should be young, be foolish but be happy. Even the Amish insist that young people leave their communities for a few years between the ages of 16 and 20 for “Rumspringa” which translates as “running around.”But what happens when the best years of your life are played out against a global pandemic and the world decides to ground you – counter intuitive to everything you feel inclined to do, from making out with perfect strangers to making your way in the big wide world?A recent survey by the Royal Society For Public Health claimed that three quarters of 18 to 24 year-olds are anxious about the future compared with only 47 per cent of the over-75s. With the recent fiasco over exam results, you could forgive the nation’s youth for being terrified that the grown-ups in charge are winging it in a way we simply don’t expect from our leaders.In turn, sometimes it’s hard not to feel impatient with the youth – ‘Now you’ve got something to boo-hoo about!’ – not because we old people are morally outraged by their wildness, as is the natural way, but because even before the pandemic they seemed to be carping fuss-budgets, timid beyond their years.With their allergies and anxieties and safe spaces and trigger warnings, forever being driven to climate change protests in their helicopter parents 4X4s, when they weren’t crouched over their computers looking up new reasons to worry, they were eschewing booze and sex and refusing move out in order to police their pleasure-seeking parents behaviour.Yes, these are cliches – but no more so than their equally dismissive “OK Boomer” attitude towards we baby-eating Brexiteers.Mind you, looking back, we’re fine ones to talk how my cohort loved to stomp around snarling “No future!” before going on to have an excellent time transforming ourselves into sexy-greedy Eighties go-getters. We were the last lucky generation, no doubt about it, with the Wild West End of London still affordable to live in (I bought a three-bedroomed flat in Bloomsbury in my early twenties on the strength of my job as a journalist – imagine that now!) and the media expanding at such a dizzying rate that one could be reviewing records for the pop press on a Monday and ensconced with a proper newspaper column on one of Fleet Street’s finest by Friday.I’m not at all a pessimistic person but I feel that the idea of being a teenager may revert to how it was before they were officially created in the 1950s – going straight from children to adults as soon as they can find work to support their poor old locked-down parents in the unimaginable wasteland of our devastated economy. Life certainly won’t be full of hope and adventure as my generation’s was – so much of the ambitious teenager’s life is about escaping to the big city, but who’s going to want to run away to London now there’s no there there?But let’s look on the bright side. Maybe growing up on a diet of dystopian novels and Billie Eilish fugues and dire warnings from Greta Thunberg will have tempered our young to be stronger than they seem. And if not, they can always comfort themselves with the fact that happiness declines from youth through middle age, hitting a low at 50 and rising to a peak at 70.By then a vaccine will surely have been found and the young – their clean-living ways finally paying off – can do all the things they haven’t had the chance to, as we did when we lived in modern times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"generation z find full stops intimidating experts say","story":"Full stops have become the latest casualty of youthful sensitivity as experts say they can be “intimidating”.As teenagers and those in their early twenties, Generation Z, have grown up with phones in their hands, using short messages to communicate with one another, and the punctuation mark has fallen out of fashion and become a symbol of curt passive-aggression.Linguists have been debating the use of the full stop and why some young people interpret a correctly punctuated text as a sign of annoyance.Some argued that the full stop had become redundant, as a text was now ended simply by sending it, and the sentence did not need to be finished with a punctuation mark.Linguist Dr Lauren Fonteyn tweeted “If you send a text message without a full stop, it’s already obvious that you’ve concluded the message. So if you add that additional marker for completion, they will read something into it and it tends to be a falling intonation or negative tone.”Others said the effect of a full stop changed depending on the medium of the message.Owen McArdle, a linguist at the ­University of Cambridge, said: “I’m not sure I agree about emails. I guess it ­depends how formal they are.The meaning of the full stop in online communications has been a debate raging among linguists for years.Prof David Crystal, one of the world’s leading language experts, thinks the use of the punctuation mark is being “revised in a really fundamental way”.In his 2015 book, Making a Point, he explains that instead of its original purpose, signifying the end of a sentence, it has become an “emotion marker”, signifying anger or annoyance.He said: “You look at the internet or any instant messaging exchange – anything that is a fast dialogue taking place. People simply do not put full stops in, unless they want to make a point.The full stop is now being used in those circumstances as an emotion marker.”This is also backed up by science. A 2015 study by Binghamton University in New York, involving 126 undergraduates, found that they perceived text messages ending in a full stop as being less sincere than the same message without a full stop.Researchers also found that exclamation points did the opposite of full stops, making people seem more sincere and engaged.Research leader Celia Klin said at the time: “When speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information with eye gaze, facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses and so on. People obviously can’t use these mechanisms when they are texting. Thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them – emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds and, according to our data, punctuation.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ministry defence told make new 15bn fleet ships britain","story":"The Ministry of Defence must make the new £1.5bn fleet of ships in Britain otherwise the UK is at risk of losing its shipbuilding skills forever, Labour has warned. \u2028The warning comes after the MoD asked potential suppliers to take part in market engagement about the major contract to build three Fleet Solid Support (FSS) ships that will help keep the Royal Navy\u0027s new aircraft carriers at sea, providing them with stores such as ammunition and food.The “prior information notice” on the MoD contracts website adds that it is open to “UK and international suppliers or consortiums offering a UK or international ship design, who are capable of either priming, providing a design andor integrating or building FSS ships”.Five years ago the Government announced they would build three support ships, although an order is still yet to be placed, meanwhile the National Audit Office recently highlighted the lack of support ships as a potential weakness in the MoD’s plans for the deployment of the carriers.\u2028John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, told The : “If we fail to back British skills we risk losing them for good and weakening both our security and industrial base for the future.” Mr Healey accused defence ministers of having “dithered over this decision” for five years, “when it’s a no-brainer to build these vital new ships in Britain”. \u2028“They are selling Britain short by not putting the work into UK shipyards.

Britain’s second largest city, Birmingham, is also facing local restrictions, amid a recent spike in cases. But Prof  John Clancy, of Birmingham City University, said putting the city into lockdown would be lunacy and warned current fears of a second wave were based on dodgy data.“According to the Government’s own testing figures, 87 of Birmingham’s 132 neighbourhoods did not record a single tested positive case of Covid-19 in the last week, so 716,000 Brummies live in a neighbourhood where there were no positive tests in the last week.“Fifty-three of the neighbourhoods (418,000 people) have not recorded a single case in the last 4 weeks. Forty-six neighbourhoods (371,000 people) have not recorded a single case in the last 8 weeks.”Prof Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham city council, said the current testing numbers were low and unreliable and that testing in Britain was now in total chaos. “They are all over the place. And policy responses based on it will be chaos too,” he warned.“If the so-called spikes in places like Birmingham lead to reported Covid-19 hospital admissions or reported Covid-19 deaths, then there is cause for alarm. “But the reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid-19 related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.”Last week Birmingham was placed on the national watch list by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and given ‘enhanced support’ to help prevent a lockdown. But there has been just one death recorded in the city in the past week and on Sunday, just six deaths were recorded for the whole of Britain. There are currently 834 patients in hospital with coronavirus, and 72 on ventilators.  Birmingham police said it had issued dozens of reminders of the need for social distancing after being called to more than 70 street and house parties and other unlicensed gatherings overnight.The force tweeted that they had dispersed dozens of parties, including one at Northfield on the outskirts of Birmingham which included two marquees and a DJ.“Everyone packed up and went home after we arrived,” Birmingham Police tweeted. “Please understand we are still in a pandemic.”In a separate tweet, the force said officers had ‘responded to over 70 street and house parties and other unlicensed events’ on Saturday night.The National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council has warned that forces in England and Wales will continue to increase patrols heading into the bank holiday weekend. Areas of concern, such as Leicester and Greater Manchester, have seen deployments larger than on New Year\u0027s Eve, it said.But Prof Clancy said: “So-called ‘spikes’ are occurring here, there, and everywhere up and down the country because new testing regimes are causing them either with false positives, picking up residual infections or (usually more likely) suddenly increased testing in specific areas.“‘Just in case’ lockdowns are simply not an acceptable response to dodgy data.

The Sunday Times reports that the BBC is discussing whether to remove the traditional anthems from the show, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Both performances typically involve much flag waving from attendees. However, organisers are apparently wondering whether to scrap them due to the anthems’ perceived association with slavery and colonialism. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFinnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who will perform on the Last Night, is among those reportedly keen to tone down the more overtly patriotic elements and give it a modern update. A spokeswoman for BBC Proms said: “We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences.”Regardless of whether the anthems are dropped, the BBC Proms 2020 will be noticeably different to previous years. The majority of the 2020 Proms season will be made up from highlights from the BBC archive. Two weeks of live shows will take place at The Royal Albert Hall from Friday 28 August.Last Night of the Proms\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspLand of Hope and Glory\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Fans have been tweeting about the dramatic transformation of the Irish actor, who stars opposite Robert Pattinson‘s Batman, as well as Zoe Kravtiz and Paul Dano.While there are plenty of talking points in the clip, which was shared by Reeves at the DC FanDome event on 22 August, it’s Farrell who has everyone worked up. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis appearance, which was achieved with the help of prosthetics, is so different that many fans claimed they didn’t even realise it was him. “The craziest thing about The Batman trailer is that this is Colin Farrell,” one person tweeted.Writer and director Ben Mekler tweeted: “Colin Farrell in prosthetics as a character actor from the NY theater scene who breaks out with a best supporting actor nom for a stand-out role in a Coen Bros movie at age 53 as The Penguin is a vibe.”A number of fans said they had confused Farrell with fellow actor, Curb Your Enthusiasm star Richard Kind.In July, Farrell praised the script for the forthcoming movie and said it is unlike any previous adaptations.“The whole prospect is really exciting,” he said. “I’m ecstatic to be part of that universe. There are certain words that are part of my internal lexicon and those words are Gotham City, Penguin, Joker, Batman, Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent... all of those things.“I have been watching the Batman films with my kids, but this script is something that feels incredibly original.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Some things are good and some are bad.FactCheck Twitter feed“I’d like to think the UK is not as bad as in other countries – the US is leading the way with that very muddy space.”In separate research, the fact-checking organisation First Draft found that Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats all published misleading advertising during the campaign.But the Tories were “by far the most frequent”, with 88 per cent of their most shared online adverts between 1 and 4 December containing misleading information, compared to 6.7 per cent for Labour.King’s College researchers said it was “difficult to calculate” whether the efforts had an impact on the election result, which saw Boris Johnson returned as prime minister with a majority increased by 47 seats.Tories set up fake fact-checking service for election debateThey warned that the coronavirus pandemic could operate as a measure of public trust in the governing party, adding: “On a daily basis, the government is trying to persuade British citizens that its reported death tolls are accurate.“It wants citizens to believe the message that it is ‘succeeding’ in controlling the epidemic, despite its recent electoral record of using disinformation tactics and admitting it unapologetically.”A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said it rejected what it called “wild assertions”.“All Conservative Party advertising was labelled, following best practice on digital imprints,” he added.“We are delivering on the promises the British public elected us on, getting Brexit done, investing in our public services and levelling-up across the country.“The research classed disinformation as a deliberate lie or misrepresentation, while misinformation can be created or spread accidentally.Dr Granelli said there was a perception that disinformation was “happening at a more industrial rate than has ever happened before” amid a global rise in online communications.Conservatives post misleading edited campaign video of Labour ministerBut she warned that it was hard to measure the impact on voting behaviour because the reasons for people’s decisions, or behind the views they form, were not fully known.Dr Granelli noted that the period since the 2016 EU referendum, which has seen two general elections, two Conservative and two Labour leadership elections, has meant party-political campaigning “continuing for a lot longer than it normally would”.The report called for more research to be done across multiple platforms to examine how false information spreads and takes root, calling claims that “Facebook, or bots, or the Russians are the core threat” a “misdiagnosis” of the problem.“A lot of the time, people are looking for information that reinforces their beliefs,” Dr Granelli said.“It might be their friends, parents, newspapers, celebrities or musicians.“It’s almost a perfect storm – the old gatekeepers have been removed and we haven’t found the right way to replace them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The competition, which sees a number of music heavyweights facing one another with their biggest hits, was launched in March. So far has included guests such as Erykah Badu vs Jill Scott, 2 Chainz vs Rick Ross, and DMZ vs Snoop Dogg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 20 years since the release of their R\u0026ampB hit “The Boy is Mine”, Brandy and Monica will now appear in a livestream on Monday 31 August, 8pm EST (1am BST).Brandy released her first album in eight years, B7, last month. Monica’s latest studio release was Code Red in 2015, which included guest features by Missy Elliot, Lil Wayne, Timbaland and Akon. The pair were the subject of major tabloid scrutiny during the Nineties, over speculation that the feud in their song had spilled over into a real-life one. While they consistently denied any rift, a planned performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards – where “The Boy is Mine” won Best R\u0026ampB Song by a Group or Duo – was called off. Just two years ago, Brandy changed the lyrics to “the song is mine” during her set at the 2018 Essence Fest.The Brandy vs Monica Verzuz episode will be streamed live from Tyler Perry Studios on Monday 31 August.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way. And Jeff Goldblum knows, he used to do a bit of stand-up.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said it was unusual that a commercial satellite would be overhead at just the right time on a cloudless day. The expert claimed that the mysterious underground base was a means of China covertly storing its military hardware - which included submarines and missile systems based inland.

The Yulin base is located on the southern end of Hainan Island, some  miles southwest of Hong Kong.It is considered one of Chinas key strategic outposts to protect its navy. Mr Thompson said that the country has a large and growing submarine fleet, which they are able to protect with underground facilities. A spokesperson for the US navy told CNN that the navy had sent one of its P-A Poseidon intelligence and reconnaissance jets on a flight near the base.The Type  submarine, believed to be the submarine seen in the pictures, is one of six in the Chinese fleet, according to the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative.

It reveals:Downing Street is pushing hard for a trade deal but is making  contingency plans for an “unruly” exit from the EU transition period at the end of December.With trade talks looking set to go the wire, there is a risk they collapse — putting up trade barriers overnight on  January.In that scenario planners believe France will force “mandatory controls on UK goods from day one” and between  and  per cent of hauliers travelling across the Channel may not be ready for this.That could see flow between Dover and Calais down  per cent for three months, triggering long queues of HGVs in Kent.It could lead to shortages of the  per cent of our food imported from the EU as well as medicines, chemicals for drinking water purication and fuel supply.This could trigger water rationing and even power cuts.Food supply across the country would be hit by panic buying at Christmas, the busiest time of year.There are also increasing fears in Whitehall that Covid- willwith a vengeance in the winter months.The planners warned that “pandemic influenza, severe flooding, a Covid second wave and an unruly exit from the EU transition period could cause a systemic economic crisis with major impact on ­disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade and market stability.”It could be combined with likely “coordinated industrial action” as well as shortages risking public disorder and a mental health crisis that will hit the poorest hardest.

It means some town halls may go bust and need bailing out or may need to be under direct control of Whitehall.And inflation could “signicantly impact social care providers due to increasing staff and supply costs”.Ministers have also been told to brace for a further  months of virus infections in care homes.There are fears of public disorder as a result of shortages and a major economic slump.The outlook is also bleak for Gibraltar and the Channel Islands, both reliant on imports.Gibraltar could be cut off from Spain and economically crippled and the Channel Islands may need airdrops of medicines and food.Three quarters of UK medicine imports come through Dover, and many have a limited shelf le — making stockpiling dficult. During the pandemic the focus on Covid has led to a slump in animal vaccine production.

And lockdowns cause deaths.”Government scientists have warned that another national shutdown could cases spike.Many nations in Europe - such as France and Spain - are seeing a rise in cases. Some towns and cities are also facing the threat of local lockdowns, such as Birmingham - which has seen  cases in the last week.Professor Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham City Council, warned current testing numbers are low and unreliable.He said: The reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid- related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.Birmingham has been placed on the national watch list by Health Secretary Matt Hancock after a rise in cases.Police have been cracking down on enforcing social distancing, and said last night they were called to more than  street and house parties.However, Professor Clancy said the government data shows  of Birminghams  neighbourhoods did not record a single positive case of coronavirus last week.He also pointed out the apparent  per cent jump in the number of casesper , over the past two weeks is actually just an increase of six people. The expert said: These are micro-numbers, and talking about them in terms of spikes just won’t do. It is certainly not enough to spark policy change.He warned local officials risk over-reacting to apparent spikes.And he said the decisions should be taken by national government as city politicians do not have a signicant enough democratic mandate.   Professor Clancy explained he backed hyper-local intervention to try and beat the coronavirus.And he added officials should only be alarmedthere is a spike in deaths, saying theyare sadly the most reliable figure during the pandemic.Britain recorded six deaths today, while England recorded a new low of one.He said: What you can’t have is local lockdown panic without a wider context. Otherwise you’ll get ridiculous decisions to lockdown completely unrelated to the actual risk.Hyper-local intervention in very local areas of concern is a much better future option. Shutting down regions and cities will be ineffective, and has already been seen to be so.He added: Until we get our testing, and track and tracing system, into proper, reliable shape we should not be basing policy on it.Fears have surfaced of second nationwide coronavirus lockdown as officials warned the end of the year will be bumpy for Britain.The Sage advisory group said Britain’s reproduction number was between . and ., with senior sources warning “more nationwide measures” may be needed. A senior government source told The : We’re looking at a pretty bumpy autumn and winter and that’s going to go in the direction of increased cases and increased outbreaks.Another source added: “If it doesn’t get contained it may be that some things that have been open, you need to think about whether measures need to be taken to reverse things.Government scientists fear Britain could follow countries like Spain, Europe’s fastest rising caseload, with  cases per , people. The number of daily cases in the holiday hotspot have risen from  when lockdown eased on June  to more than ,.National figures showed that one person died from coronavirus today in England, as the UK confirmed , new cases.Emergency plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid- coinciding with a No Deal Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ministers must ensure this does not become the new normal.“We have thousands of practices struggling to stay afloat –they go under their patients have nowhere to go.”The BDA say million treatments would have been performed by NHS and private dentists over a three-month period, before the coronavirus outbreak.But treatment fell by  per cent after dentists were forced to shut during lockdown, leaving a small number of hubs to treat dental emergencies.Since reopening, most practices are operating at around a quarter of their usual capacity.The new rules mean clinics must leave a fallow period of  minutes following procedures involving sprays, including fillings and crowns, to allow any droplets containing virus particles to settle. Staff are also having to screen all patients for coronavirus symptoms, put on PPE and disinfect equipment which potentially doubles the amount of time needed for simple treatments.The dficulties have led many surgeries to stop accepting new NHS patients, forcing many to go private or rely on emergency hubs.Matthew Garrett, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said patients should expect delays.He said: “We are not flicking a switch but entering a phased transition to the resumption of a full service and the pace of reopening remains dependent on a decline in infections.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Strict rules do not work as people seem to break them.The Scandinavian country recorded  new cases on Friday and  on Saturday.Stefan Lofven, the prime minister, insisted on Friday their response to the pandemic was right.He told the newspaper Dagens Nyheter: The strategy that we adopted, I believe is right - to protect iniduals, limit the spread of the infection.What has been discussed most, and what we did dferently in Sweden, was that we did not close schools. Now there are quite a few people who think we were right.From the beginning in the global outbreak, Sweden introduced voluntary social-distancing rules, home-working and recommendations for people to avoid public transport.The compulsory measures that were brought in included a ban on gatherings of more than  people, restrictions on visiting care homes, and table-only service in bars and restaurants.However, the decision to not lockdown has come with consequences.A total of , Swedes have died of Covid- - signicantly higher than its neighbours Norway,Denmark and Finland.Anders Tegnell, the top epidemiologist leading the response to Swedens pandemic, claimed the infection rates of Spain, Belgium and France have increased after mask mandates in public spaces came in.

Our results indicate that roughly twice as many people have developed T-cell immunity compared with those who we can detect antibodies in.Earlier this month, the BBC pointed out that Swedens antibody rate is fairly similar to the UKs.The broadcaster said it compared with  per cent of Londoners found with coronavirus antibodies when tested in April and May, and five-to-ten per cent of people living in Geneva.Sweden has faced sharp criticism for the governments decision to not lockdown.

A quarter of all goods tested showed levels of poisons including lead, arsenic and mercury, an investigation by campaign group Unchecked UK discovered. But with only half of councils were carrying out examinations, there are potentially thousands of hazardous goods in circulation, it warned. Unchecked UKaposs Emma Rose said: “Most people support strong rules on chemical safety. “They want to know the everyday products in their homes – like clothes, cosmetics and children’s toys – are free from toxic chemicals. “But our research shows that these protections are being undermined by poor enforcement as local public protection teams simply aren’t being given the resources they need – with potentially dangerous consequences.  “As we rebuild our communities after the pandemic, public bodies must be given adequate funding to fulfil their vital duties and close the enforcement gap our research has revealed.” Unchecked submitted freedom of information requests to all councils in England, Scotland and Wales, asking how many products were tested, what chemicals were discovered breaching safe limits, and the numbers of prosecutions launched. Of  local authorities which replied,  took no samples over the last three years. Of those that carried out tests, , products were analysed for hazardous chemicals. Some  – % – were found to have breached legal limits. The most common chemical discovered was hydroquinone, which is used in skin lightening treatments and was found in  samples. Where chemical breaches were identied, three-quarters of councils took no legal action. Experts blamed Tory cuts to local government, with a % plunge in funding from Whitehall since , for creating gaps in trading standardsapos regimes. Between  and , the number of local authority trading standards staff fell by %, from , to ,. Spending on trading standards by English councils plunged by %. National Consumer Federation chairman Arnold Pindar said: “Unchecked UK’s research gives further evidence that local public protection teams are seriously under-resourced, with too many hazardous consumer goods going untested and finding their way into our homes. “Not only is this a danger to the public, but the lack of enforcement also undermines the ability of businesses that meet regulations and provide safe products to compete in UK markets. “Public bodies need to be given adequate funding to fulfil their vital role in keeping our communities safe.” Shadow Business Minister Alan Whitehead said: This investigation has exposed that in taking away resources from local public protection teams, the Government has risked unsafe products making it to shop shelves and doing real harm. Over the past decade, local authorities have come under increasing pressures as the Tories have systematically stripped them of £billion of core government funding.“If the Government backtracks on its pledge to support councils in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, both the visible and more unseen consequences could be severe.Nesil Caliskan, of the Local Government Association, said: “Although it is ultimately the responsibility of manufacturers, suppliers and retailers to ensure the products they produce or sell comply fully with safety laws, councils work extremely hard to maintain and improve safety standards – despite severe budget pressures on their services.  “Trading standards budgets and staffing have been cut by around half since , which makes it extremely dficult for some councils to maintain previous inspection levels, given the competing demands of areas such as social care, children’s services and homelessness.” Chartered Trading Standards Institute chief executive Leon Livermore told the Mirror: “This highlights the fact that while the UK has reputable businesses, there are still issues and problems with unsafe products entering the market and itaposs important that government – both local and central – takes responsibility for that. “Its important that there is proper investment into protective professions, because the consequences of getting this wrong are risks to le and limb.

Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey called on ministers to finally award the £.billion contract for three Fleet Solid Support vessels to a British consortium. A Spanish-led team is bidding for the work to build the Royal Navy supply ships, which campaigners say will support , jobs. The battle comes as a major Whitehall defence and security review is underway. Mr Healey said: “For five years, defence ministers have dithered over this decision when it’s a no-brainer to build these vital new ships in Britain. “They are selling Britain short by not putting the work into UK shipyards.“No other major military nation has ordered naval support ships from foreign yards. “What can be built in Britain now, must be built in Britain – and long-term defence and security procurement must also involve plans to develop the UK’s future capacity to build in Britain. “This is one test by which we will judge the Government’s new integrated review of defence and security.” The ,-tonne vessels will resupply Royal Navy aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates with food, ammunition and explosives.For national security reasons, Royal Navy warships can only be built in the UK. But because the supply ships will be part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, they are not classed as warships – meaning they can be built abroad. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: “We very much welcome the aposBuilt in Britainapos test and believe it should be applied to every major industry project that is funded by the taxpayer in order to preserve our skills base and ability to design, build and maintain complex projects. “These ships are the cornerstone for the future of the British shipbuilding industry. “Placing the order in the UK will bridge the gap between the end of the aircraft carrier programme and the next tranche of ships on order which will provide highly-skilled employment for a generation in areas that need it most. “If the Prime Minister is serious about levelling up in the regions he will jump at the chance of building these ships in Britain as a straightforward means to pump investment into our regions and get the economy up and running again after the coronavirus lockdown. “Working people in our shipbuilding communities simply don’t understand why ministers are insisting on inviting foreign shipyards to tender. Community steelworkersapos union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “We know that steelworks in the UK have the capacity to produce the bulk of the materials needed for the proposed Fleet Solid Support ships.  “The Prime Minister promised that steel produced in the UK would be first in line in the planned ‘infrastructure revolution’. “Building these ships in Britain, and building them using Britain’s steel, is this Government’s opportunity to stand by their word and stand by our industry.” The competition for the contract was initially offered worldwide, with companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea shortlisted, along with a UK consortium. The British team, backed by the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, includes Babcock, BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and Rolls-Royce. The tendering process was halted suddenly in November – raising hopes the terms could be reset to boost British firmsapos chances of winning the deal. But earlier this month, the Ministry of Defence triggered fresh dismay when foreign firms were invited to take part in early plans to build them. The prior information notice says the deal is open to UK and international suppliers or consortiums offering a UK or international ship design, who are capable of either priming, providing a design and or integrating or building FSS ships. Four weeks previously, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace fuelled hopes the deal would go to a UK yard.

The winding down of the furlough scheme begins next month when companies become responsible for paying % of staffaposs wages and the Government cuts its contribution from % to %. Experts fear the move could accelerate redundancies. Labour published analysis showing the relatively high proportions of people working in ious industries around the county. The sector hardest hit by mass redundancies since the coronavirus pandemic struck has been retail, with manufacturing and aviation also badly impacted.Data uncovered by the party shows that more than % of the North West’s workforce is in the retail sector – the highest proportion anywhere in the UK. Wales and the North East are second and third in terms of the proportion of the workforce in retail. Almost % of the workforce in the East Midlands is in manufacturing – the highest proportion in the whole country. The West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, Wales, the North East and North West all have between % and % of their workforce in the manufacturing sector. In comparison, just .% of London’s workforce is in manufacturing. However, the capital could be hardest hit by damage to the aviation and travel industries. Some .% of its workforce is in the aviation industry, with , jobs relying on aviation and travel.  Shadow Business Minister Matthew Pennycook said: “Ministers are writing off parts of the UK as the country enters recession, with figures suggesting some places will be disproportionately impacted by the jobs crisis. “Labour is calling for the Government to U-turn on their damaging blanket approach to withdrawing furlough, which fails to consider the circumstances of dferent sectors nor the impact on the communities that have a proud history in these industries. “The Government needs to do right by these communities and businesses, and see them through the crisis by targeting support, not pull the le raft away while the storm is still raging on. With a disproportionate number of women and young people working in retail – the hardest-hit sector – the Governmentaposs approach also risks exacerbating inequalities already faced by these people too.

Rob Ryder, , tumbled down the stairs at his home in Chorley. Lancashire four months ago and collapsed in agony on the floor with horrendous pain in his leg. The self-employed doorman had felt discomfort in his limb for some time prior to the accident. But weeks earlier a doctor had put Robaposs pain down to sciatica - a fairly common nerve issue. After arriving at the hospital Rob was found to have broken his hip in the fall. However, the tests revealed something far more serious was also wrong with the dad-of-two. The pain in his leg was not sciatica but cancer in his hip, which had weakened the bone - causing him to lose his balance and fall down the stairs. Worse news was still to come a week later when experts discovered the cancer had spread from a tumour in his colon that had been silently growing more than year. In June Rob was given the devastating news the cancer had gone to his bones, meaning he is beyond a cure and will die from the disease. He said: When I fell down the stairs I thought I had just broken a bone or aggravated the sciatica. But at the hospital they told me it was cancer in my hip and I was devastated, I thought I was going to die and went into a bit of a depression. Then just as I started to think more positively I got the second diagnosis and was told it was incurable - that really took me back and I was in a terrible place. Rob added: Luckily Iaposve had amazing support from my family and now Iaposm thinking positively again, I just want to make the most of each day. Rob doesnapost know how rapidly the cancer will progress or how long he has to live, although itaposs thought heaposs unlikely to survive beyond five years. He expects to begin chemotherapy to try and slow the growth in the coming months.  In the meantime Rob has been taking joy and inspiration from his youngest son Kai, six, who was there when the fall happened and has been fundraising for his beloved dad ever since. The football-loving schoolboy has raised over £, so far, which he intends to spend on a family holiday to Egypt in February. Kai said: I love my daddy and I wanted to go on holiday with him. Iaposm going to use the money I raised so we can go to Egypt together. Weaposre going to have fun playing on the beach and in the sun. Kai lives with his mum Toni Travis and older brother in Blackpool. While Rob lives with his partner Nicola and her children in nearby Chorley. He also has another son, -year-old Jordan. Rob said he will travel to Egypt in February alongside Kai, Nicola, and her daughter Poppy, , as well as his sister and her partner. He added: I think itaposs going to be a really important holiday for everyone to make memories, as Iaposm not going to be around forever. It will be especially important for Kai because heaposs so young. Iaposm so proud of him and the way he has handled everything, for him to have raised money to help me is absolutely incredible. Heaposs an amazing boy. Kaiaposs mum Toni described says she is also incredibly proud of her son for what he has done to help his dad. She said: When Kai found out about his dad he said he wanted to do something to help.

It is unclear why the deal fell through. The revelations were made during a BBC Panorama investigation into the detention of British and other western citizens in Iran, which airs on Monday night on BBC One at .pm. It has long been claimed Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe is being held in order to force the UK into settling a multi-million pound dispute with Iran. The debt dates back to the s when the then-Shah of Iran paid the UK £ million for , chieftain tanks. When he was toppled in , Britain refused to deliver the tanks to the new Islamic Republic but kept the cash, despite British courts accepting that the money should be repaid. Panorama said that according to its sources, the Ministry of Defence has objected to the repayment. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe has said the Iranian authorities have told her that her release hinges on the money being ed. But publicly the Iranian authorities have denied any link between the debt and Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfeaposs imprisonment. The UK Foreign Office also said they do not recognise any linkage between the debt and her imprisonment, adding it is unhelpful to suggest otherwise. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe has so far served four years in prison and is currently on temporary release under effective house arrest at her parentsapos home in Tehran due to the Covid- pandemic.  It is unclear whether she will be permanently freed or recalled to prison. She was arrested at Tehran airport in April  as she was ing to London with her daughter, following a visit to her parents to introduce them to their grandchild. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was convicted of spying and jailed for five years. She has been afforded diplomatic protection by the UK Government, which states that she is innocent and that her treatment by Iran failed to meet obligations under international law.

Not the PM’s cynical lying, not the arrogance and not the laziness – though these are all per­­ilous traits reinforcing his unsuitability for high office – but the grotesque ineptitude of a harmfully useless charlatan. This is the chancer who flies by the seat of his privileged pants, who demonstrated a frightening lack of concern for the aspirations of millions of children over testing. People who, foolishly, cut Johnson a bit of slack over sky-high virus death tolls and dire financial damage aren’t giving him the benefit of the doubt over the entirely avoidable BTEC, GCSE and A-level shambles. It’s why Starmer is now preferred to Johnson as PM in polls and, nine months after an election drubbing, the Labour Party has inched to within a couple of points of the Conservatives.One-time chief prosecutor Starmer is widely viewed as competent, while ex-magazine editor Johnson is seen as incompetent.Starmer successfully ran the hugely complex Crown Prosecution Service.Johnson was forced to apologise for mistakes at the Spectator, once dubbed The Sextator. Just as voters cared about the Back to Basics tawdry hypocrisy during John Major’s tortuous long goodbye in the s, Starmer is betting on people becoming fed up with Johnson’s stumbling in the s. The PM who gted a free pass to rule-breaker Dominic Cummings, promoted a crony behind a test-and-trace system reaching only half of contacts and is overseeing a regime stained by corruption allegations isn’t going to wake up any morning soon as a newly able leader.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have already moved into into their plush £m home in Santa Barbra, Calornia, after leaving their friendaposs LA mansion last month. A spokesperson claimed the couple had settled into the quiet privacy of their community since moving with baby Archie in early July. The couple have reportedly been rubbing shoulders with celebrity neighbours such as Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey. But Mark Karloff, who has photographed celebrities in LA for over a decade, says the couple are naive for thinking they can escape press intrusion.  He added that the paparazzi pack has already located their home and photographers are already waiting for the couple to venture outside.The Paparazzi Podcast host told Daily Star : Itaposll be the same thing, there will be photographers around town waiting for them.Because they are there to get other people as well, itaposs not just them up there. Ellen is a big story right now, she is living up there, Oprah is there all the time and a few other celebrities that are still there right now, like Orlando and Katie Perry. They come and go also. All I have seen or heard about is a couple of photographers found the mansion. Because everybody was wondering which one it was, there were a couple of photographers that actually found it. Not of Harry and Meghan, just of the property. I talked to a couple photographers, supposedly they are the ones that found it. And Karloff believes that continued press intrusion at their new mansion could even be a final straw. He continued: It could be a final straw, it could be, I just donapost think that they are too smart about what they are doing. Iaposve had conversations with celebrities, before I was even in the industry, on where they should move tothey donapost want to be seen,they want their privacy.  And there are places that these people can go, without being bothered too much, places that have multiple exits, places that are very private, but they are not around a group of other celebrities. It seems like they want to live next door to Oprah, they want to live next door next to Ellen, they want that hype of the place they live but that diminishes the privacy. Just move somewhere on their own, away from Hollywood, away from the celebrities, away from all this stuff, and they can live in privacy, or somewhat privacy.

But that wasn’t the only surprise as she only gave birth to one twin at first. Dylan was born on January , , weighing lb oz and then labour suddenly stopped. Medics hoped Joanne would be able to carry the other baby full term as he was in his own sac and able to survive alone. But two days later, the police officer, from Swinton, welcomed Oscar on January  weighing lbs. She said: “I had a lovely pregnancy and I was enjoying every second as everything was running smoothly with no cravings and barely any sickness. “I had a scan a week before my waters broke and everything was fine so I was very confused and panicked when my waters had broke at  weeks and five days.  “I went straight to St. Mary’s Hospital with my partner Anthony, , and a few hours later - I was in labour. “Dylan was born at .am but he was in a poor state and needed resuscitating for  minutes. “We almost lost him which was very traumatic.  “It was so strange as I was focusing on him but also bracing myself to push again but hours passed and nothing happened. “Time passed but nothing happened and the doctor said I have to stay on strict bed rest to try and keep the other baby in for as long as possible. “I was shocked as I didn’t know know that was possible. In a way, I just wanted Oscar to come too as it felt weird having one but not the other. Joanne was unable to visit Dylan in NICU but was given an iPad to watch him in the incubator.  Oscar was born at :am at  weeks. She said: “I really wanted to see Dylan but I knew I had to follow the doctors orders to do what is best for Oscar. “Every hour counted towards his development so it was vital for me to stay on bed rest to ensure he was given the best chance. “Fortunately, he was born without any health complications.  “We always say the extra two days did Oscar the world of good as he had zero complications and was taken off the ventilation first.” Joanne described them as ‘delicate and poorly’ when she first held them after two weeks. The twins were put into a cot with one another for the first time after three months in NICU. Joanne worried they may not form a special bond having spent so much time apart.

Beverley Edwards, , of Chesham, Hertfordshire, arrived at Pontins Brean Sands on Monday after a three-hour drive with her partner, Vivian Alderton.

Upon her arrival she discovered stains, mould, flies and an aposoverpoweringapos smellShe told SomersetLive : I was told by a man wearing security unorm where we check-in and I was pointed to the reception. Have you suffered from a poor Pontins experience this summer  Email webnews@mirrorI ended up in a queue where I heard complaints from other customers about missing things like plates, glasses. Someone said their place had flooded and another said their bedding was wet. There were people stunned and with their mouths open hearing all the other stories people were saying at the reception.  Miss Edwards, who has mobility issues, was directed to her chalet and walked on a muddy footpath and through an overgrown tree to access it. Miss Edwards then pulled the door open and was left shocked by the state of her absolutely filthy accommodation. She said: There was an overpowering smell of mould and a sour and dirty odour which filled the room. It was so tiny. There were damaged chairs stacked and a table with a filthy base.  To the left of the door was a broom with hairs and mess appearing to be there while cleaning being done. But clearly cleaning hadnapost been done. There was dust, dirt, cobwebs and lumps of unidentied stuff around. The plastic settee bed had stains on it. Along with her problems, she encountered mouldy curtains, a stained cooker top and oven, with dead flies inside the ceiling light and around the chalet. She saw she found unidentied items which she feared were stains or tobacco in the draws, kettle and wardrobe.  Miss Edwards added: Inside the bedroom, there were two single beds. One had a plastic coating and the other looked older than I am and had stains. The bedding provided looked cheap and unhealthy. I didnapost touch or smell it and did not want to sleep in it. Miss Edwards was also left unsettled by the thumping music, people shouting and could smell people smoking in the nearby area.She was also concerned about hygiene and lack of guests wearing masks at the resort during the coronavirus pandemic - a time where resorts are undertaking more cleaning to curb any spread of Covid-. Unhappy with the state of her chalet, she ed to the reception and patiently complained about the issues she encountered to a manager. Miss Edwards was offered a deep clean of her chalet but after overhearing a long wait for cleaners and other customers reportedly asking for their rooms to be cleaned, she declined the offer. She said: I could not wait in that accommodation and wait for someone to come to clean the room. It was not nice and I felt quite uncomfortable. I refused a deep clean due to the wait.

Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by financier Jeffrey Epstein, alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her on three separate occasions - including when she was , still a minor under US law. This morning she claimed she was gted to the royal, and voiced her fury on Twitter. She wrote: All the evidence you could poke a stick out and yet the justice system defends a known predator who just happens to be a prince, anyone  would be thrown into jail. He knew I had no choice- he knew I was being trafficked- gted to him. Nothings all right. Running out of hope.  Ms Giuffre, who was pictured with the Duke of York in London in London, has previously said she hopes Andrew is put “in a cell next to his best mate” Ghislaine Maxwell. The former teen ‘sex slave’ of Jeffrey Epstein spoke out after the chief of the politan Police offered to assist US authorities with their investigation into the US paedophile. Dame Cressida Dick said that while the focus of the FBI probe was “clearly” in America, she added the Met would assist US authorities should it be required “at any stage”. The help could include looking at Andrew’s ties to his friends Epstein and Maxwell.Prosecutors in the States claim they have been stonewalled by requests to interview Andrew, , with one prosecutor saying in January the Prince has provided “zero cooperation”.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

David Thomas, head of St Illtydaposs Catholic High School in Rumney, said: Any school would be better for having Nicola in it and we were fortunate to have her as part of our community. Polite, respectful and hardworking, Nicola was also so full of fun, kindness and generosity to others.Mr Thomas added that they were still reeling from the events of Friday evening, according to the BBC.Sometimes words are just not enough and do not do a person justice. This is certainly the case with Nicola, he said. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends and like the rest of the community we will do all we can to help and support them during, and beyond, this awful time. Prayers were said for Nicola and her family at her local catholic church on Sunday.  We prayed for Nicola and for her family at masses today, said Father Brian Gray at St John Lloyd Church in Trowbridge.A tribute posted on the Facebook page for St John Lloyd Church and St Cadoc Churches said: As a pupil at St Illtydaposs Catholic High School she was part not just of a school, but of a community of pupils, parents, teachers, governors and staff.Our prayers are that Nicola will be part of the kingdom of heaven and that she will have eternal le with Jesus.

Pupils have already missed out on schooling because of the lockdown and risk falling behind still furtherthe disruption continues. The Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, speaks sense when he says children are more likely to be harmed by not attending school than from catching coronavirus. What is missing is not the will but the reassurance. Parents and teachers need to know that every effort has been made to make sure pupils and staff are safe. They also want clarication on what will happenthere is a further spike in infections. This requires leadership. Unfortunately, we have been lumbered with one of the worst Education Secretaries ever to hold the post.Few have confidence in Gavin Williamson, especially now we know he took a jaunt to the seaside at the height of the exams fiasco. If we want our kids back in the classroom we need a clear plan that works for parents, teachers and pupils.  Don’t sink us Labour is right to demand the new fleet of Navy support vessels is built in Britain. Given the £.billion order will support , jobs it is incomprehensible the Government is considering handing the contract overseas. Furthermore, these ships should be built using British steelpossible. One benefit of Brexit is the UK will no longer be bound by EU procurement rules that mean any country in the bloc can bid for tenders. Having pushed for our departure you would have thought Boris Johnson would want to take advantage of this new situation.

Paying up a the end off your weekly shop becomes a personal challenge to try and bag the items as quickly as the cashier is scanning them - and itaposs one youaposre likely to lose. With a queue of keen spectators looking on, many shoppers crack under the pressure - but one mum has revealed she simply doesnapost give them the chance.  Aldi customers have previously shared hilarious hacks to slow down the checkout staff, including one who advised scrunching up the packaging around the barcode so it wouldnapost scan first time. Others said they preferred to work in teams, with one slowly handing the items over one at a time at the till while the other packs. But sometimesyou donapost ask, you donapost get - and thataposs exactly what one mum said she does in a discussion on the Aldi Mums Facebook page. You can ask them to slow down, I do, she said. They don’t mind. And never had a rude checkout operator either.  And it turns out plenty of others have been doing the same, as another said: I always ask the checkout workers at my local ALDI to slow down a bit, so I don’t get overwhelmed. They always say yes and it’s always very pleasant, never had a problem. But for others the sheer panic of racing to pack was all part of the Aldi experience, as reported by Kidspot.

Each year Brits make up seven million of the Spanish resort’s . million tourists – until the pandemic hit trade. Last month travellers to the UK from Spain were told they would have to self-isolate for  days. Jose Maria Caballe, Benidorm’s biggest hotelier, believes the town must ditch its cheap and cheerful image after the current health crisis. He said: “We can’t cater for low-level clientele to get drunk for three days. This doesn’t happen in a modern country. “Benidorm has to change because the costs are going up and hotels can’t work with such low prices. “The pandemic has been like a decisive punch to a boxer already on the ropes. The popular market will neverto the same level. When the market recovers there will be demand for more quality.” Mr Caballe, who owns  hotels, said the town’s future held lessons for tourism in Spain, which brings in % of the nation’s GDP. He said: “During the s, s and s the standard of living in Spain was very low. People put up with noise and ­drunkenness because they needed to.” "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/08/118343683_335586064245440_4750489568275119054_n-84x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"alex salmond is poised to launch legal action against the bbc over documentary","story":"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing.

Every day the lockdown continued # necessary though that was # damaged local businesses, jobs, and Aberdeen#s economy.#The commitment of people in Aberdeen to sticking to the local lockdown rules and the hard work of NHS staff has driven down the Coronavirus infection rate to a point where it is now possible to end the local lockdown.#Every single person and business in Aberdeen must continue to stick to all the rules and guidelines to minimise the risk of a further Coronavirus outbreak in Aberdeen. A further outbreak, with the attached risk of a further local lockdown, would be disastrous for our city and its economy.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

E-bikes offer a greater mileage for commuting with less physical effort required and a safer means of physical distancing.ldquoE-bike public hire stations, which will be managed by another company, will be installed in Musselburgh at the Brunton Hall and next to Musselburgh Train Station in autumn.ldquoE-bike hire areas in other towns across East Lothian are proposed. In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing.

Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Butthe free traders and corporate influencers in Westminster get their way and deregulate the law that currently governs genetic engineering there, gene edited foods could be green lighted, unlabelled, for English plates, so that most people wouldnrsquot realise that they were eating them.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would then be put under heavy international corporate pressure to do the same.Like the old guard, now stigmatised, genetically modiedfood before it, with its unhappy history of failures to deliver and creation of new problems, such as the creation of herbicide-resistant super-weeds, proponents of gene editing spin futuristic yarns about all the miracles theyrsquore rustling up for us.Less starchy potatoes and corn, pork from super-muscly pigs, spicy tomatoes, and mushrooms that resist browning, are some front runners. In fact the mushrooms have already bypassed US Department of Agriculture regulation.How can this second wave of genetically engineered foods be a realistic prospect when the first lot were so unpopular in the UK and the EU that the general public shunned them Proponents claim that gene editing is a precise, safe technology with predictable outcomes. Sound familiar  They say that theyrsquore only making very small changes to the genetic make-up of foods, merely mimicking what might happen through natural mutation.Tellingly, they seek patents for these altered foods. Patents are only grantedyou can show an inventive step that is man-made. So claims that gene editing is simply causing changes that could happen naturally go out the window.Donrsquot worry, though, they assure us that gene editing carries no more risk than conventional breeding. In fact, there is no evidence to support this blaseacute assertion because no feeding studies have been carried out in either humans or animals.Along with scientists from around the world, I attended a briefing on gene editing led by the London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou. It left me deeply concerned. He flagged up the growing body of gold standard scientic research that highlights the unintended and potentially dangerous risks that gene edited foods pose. Far from being precise and predictable, these lab-based, articial interventions damage plant or animal DNA, not just at the intended site of the genetic alteration, but where.For instance, it emerged last year that a hornless bull gene edited by a Minnesota company was unintentionally contaminated by bacterial genes from another species. https:www.technologyreview     recombinetics-gene-edited-hornless-cattle-major-dna-screwup Gene editing alters how genes , which can create new allergens and toxins. The European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility ndash  leading international scientists ndash has expressed grave concerns. They say that the radical nature of gene edited changes could result in ldquounexpectedly high levels of known toxins, or even in the creation of novel ones.So, the bottom line here is that therersquos a push to slip gene edited food ingredients into our food, unlabelled, most likely sneakily lost in multi-ingredient, ultra-processed foods, on the assumption that they pose no risk. So far, the general public is blissfully unaware of it.To ensure public safety and the integrity of the food we eat, its absolutely vital that all ingredients from gene edited crops, plants, or farm animals, be subjected to risk assessment of the most stringent nature.These novel creations must be tightly regulated, with track and trace systems in place so that in the case of a genetically engineered public health disaster, retailers can put out effective product recalls.Most crucially, gene edited food must be clearly labelled as genetically modied so that we can choose for ourselveswersquore prepared to eat it.

It rains there, too, and the thinking is as wild as in any war poem. Summerwater is lighter on its feet but no less anxious than Mossrsquos  masterpiece Ghost Wall. Good stories grow anywhere and these characters are cooped up in their cabins, wary of their neighbours and awkward with themselves.Do holidays imply peace of mind  Well. Summerwater begins with Justine, who runs early in the morning while the rest of her family are still asleep. At the start of the book shersquos considering where to go. If she runs as long as she wants to, she might have to snack later, andshe snacks the children will want to do the same. Then she remembers:ldquoShes got four protein bars tucked into her packet of sanitary towels in the suitcase, the only place no one  is likely to look, and shes not too proud to eat them in the bathroomshe has to.Its an aside but, in this book, nothing feels like an aside. This is a subtle but signicant scene in which Moss takes us into her confidence. When it comes to the workings of the secret heart, and the exchange between mind and body, this is a writer with few equals .Here we have the normalcy and lunacy of Brits on holiday. When Claire gets an hour to herself, she tries to lick the hair on her nipples. There is Milly who, in the build up to Project Simultaneous Orgasms, wonders about bread for sandwiches. Quite a feat, when you think of it, to be even considering sex in a Scottish cabin park in the rain. David, a retired doctor, knows the road by the loch as well as he knows the human body. And Moss is just as good on the body - childbirth, say - as she is on teenagers, or slugs. Though shersquos quite superb on slugs: ldquoThings shouldnrsquot be made like thathellipSpores drt up from the pages and you start to feel another presence entirely: alongside holidaymakers in repose - and distress - are short chapters told from inside an anthill, or from the point of view of a doe. Then these spectral fears dissolve into a characterrsquos annoyance with the crust on a baking tray.Not until rather late in the day does something happen to disturb this equilibrium. There hasnrsquot seemed to be any plan. But there is always a plan and, by now, Moss has done all the work she needs to do. This a writer in whose gts we trust, and she pulls off feat after feat of daring and empathy and wisdom.Justine, whose thoughts on running might be mistaken for Mossrsquo own considerations on the writing process, completes marathons in private. And Mossrsquos sentences run on too. You hear them long after you read them thought and feeling dissolving with animal grace. And, even as you delight in them, her paragraphs swing off and away - bound for the horizon  - only to be found by the side of the road, bent double, not in exhaustion but in the study of an object in close quarters, just as we do when we remember whatrsquos so revelatory about Scotland in the rain."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotlands-schools-pupils-tested-positive-safe","story":"Less than one week since their , several schools across the country have recorded one or more positive cases of coronavirus in either pupils, staff orpeople connected to their institutions.During that time, schools in Aberdeenshire, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Perth and Kinross and Renfrewshire have recorded positive cases.Health bosses have stressed that there is currently no evidence of transmission within schools, and cases appear to be from community transmissions.Anywhere that has seen a positive case has been quickly identied and contact tracing has been carried out.Kids and staff have so far been given the all-clear to remain in school and continue to attend, except those who have been identied as close contacts of any affected person.Here are all the schools in Scotland with either pupils, staff or people connected to them who have tested positive.Please note - this list also includes schools where contact tracing is being carried out, but cases have not been confirmed by the local health board.

Most Govanites would agree and the area is without doubt the one with the strongest sense of identity amongst the cityrsquos older working class districts.Many people would know that Govan was the former World Capital of Shipbuilding where at its height in the ldquoThree Yairds, men produced about a quarter of the worldrsquos tonnage of ships.They might also know that Govan was one of the cradles of the labour movement, with the emergence of trades unions, the co-operative organisations and the Labour Party, with a strong tradition of struggle from the Rent Strikes of World War One, through to the occupation of the shipyards in the early s with the UCS work-in. And would be aware that with the decline of shipbuilding in the last  years, Govan has fallen on hard times, its population reduced to less than , from the figure of , when the burgh was annexed by Glasgow in .But would they know that Govan is considerably older than Glasgow which annexed it  And that for centuries, as an ecclesiastical centre of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde, it was more important than the city  Would they know anything about Govanrsquos collection of early Christian incised stones, one of the finest in Scotland and indeed the UK .Possibly not and it might well surprise more than a few that Govan can claim to have the finest collection of A-listed buildings and public sculpture outside the city centre and west end of Glasgow, dating from the time of its economic prosperity and industrial greatness. Those yet ignorant ndash and even those in the know, since Govan is changing and developing after decades of stagnation ndash should hop on that clockwork orangeand disembark at Govan Cross subway station ndash and take the following walkabout round Central Govan as an introduction to hopefully further personal explorations.THE WALK. Around Govan Cross you see the beneficial effects of the Town Centre Action Plan, which at a cost of pound. million ndash a bankerrsquos bonus ndash made an improvement to the area, providing paving, seating, signage ndash and a restoration of the Aitken Fountain. This was an  memorial to Govanrsquos first Medical Officer of Health whose sanitary improvements massively reduced death rate in the mid-th century.As well as many other insignia the fountain sports the coat of arms of the burgh of Govan, established in , which shows ying icons but always a shiprsquos engineer and a shiprsquos carpenter. See how many such emblems you can spot on your ramble ndash and whether you can spot a single Glasgow one!There is much to here but the jewel is the refurbished former British Linen Bank by Salmon  Gillespie, an A-listed tenement from , with a delightful open-crown metal roof. Its sculptures are especially fine look at the one above the door showing two male angels driving a sailing boat by blowing their conches. Here you stand on Water Row, once a Roman road to a Clyde crossing, later the centre of the fishing and weaving community.. Moving west along the Govan Road, on your left is a statue of William Pearce, owner of the Fairfield yard and Govan MP in the s. Coming from the Chatham naval dockyard he brought war work and massive prosperity to Fairfieldrsquos, and to himself, dying worth a present day fortune of pound million. He stands beside Brechinrsquos Bar, a mock baronial building from over a century ago, which was originally Cardellrsquos Temperance Institute.Once when in there the punter next me at the bar turned unannounced and stated, ldquoSee that Noam Chomsky, we had him in here in the Year of Culture. I have never investigated the truth of this, nor of the claim of the regulars of Brechinrsquos that, at chucking out time, the Black Man, as they call the statue, takes a few steps.Opposite Brechinrsquos is located the Pearce Instutute or PI, known as the Heart of Govan. Lady Pearce gave the money for its foundation in memory of her husband and it opened in  as a cultural and social centre, with a theatre, library, billiard room and washing and cooking facilities for the majority who lacked adequate facilities. These were located in the Womenrsquos area, entered by a separate door. Times change, and females can enter the front door nowadays. The A-Listed PI was designed by Edinburgh architect Rowand Anderson in an eclectic style one half Dutch Renaissance, the other Scottish Vernacular. Atop the latter part sits a metal galleon made by the workers of Fairfields, who also contributed much free labour to helping build the. PI... Moving further west we reach the War Memorial to those killed in the First World War, behind which lies another of Govanrsquos glories, the Old Kirk . Space prohibits more than mentioning that this ndash also by Rowan Anderson ndash stands on a site that has probably been one of Christian worship for  years and a pagan one beforehand, and that it contains one of the finest collections of incised early Christian stones in Scotland, over  ndash crosses, grave slabs and the famous Govan Hogbacks as well as thereputed sargophacus of St Constantine. The connections with the Reformationand the Iona Community, add further fascination. .Between here and the next stop, Fairfields, there stands a iety of tenement buildings, some in good repair, some in less ndash and examples of the new tenements built in the last  years. The Lyceum, a former art-deco palace of a cinema is also passed and high up on it is an illustration of the original Lyceum Music Hall, destroyed in a fire. When it opened in , a packed audience heard a performance of Bizetrsquos Carmen. See Govan, see Kulcher.. On reaching ElderStreet on the right, the gates of the former Fairfield Yard, now BAE Systems, loom into view no longer do  men stream in and out of here twice a day the old tramlines which brought goods into the yards are still visible amongst the cobbles. A further walk along Govan Road brings you to the impressive front door of the former offices of the yard, now Fairfield Heritage, hosting a fine display on the history of shipbuilding housed in a building to match. The offices were designed by Keppie and Honeyman, the firm Macintosh later worked for, and though splendid inside, their finest feature is the doorway itself where amongst the usual icons of nymphs and Neptune, stand two le-size sandstone scultures of working men done by Pittendreich Macgillivray. This building is also A-Listed..Though achieving its maximum size under Pearce, the yard became a world leader under the previous owners, the Elders. Crossing the road gives a good view of the office building and also allows entrance to Elder Park, the only piece of ground in central Govan formerly not covered by tenements or industry. The park has a ied collection of sculptures relating to Govanrsquos history and a boating pond. Previously there was also a dairy farm and a small zoo!Just south of the park gates stands a statue of John Elder, leaning on the compound steam engine he invented, which gave Clyde shipbuilding a competitive edge. The statue was exectued by Boehm and is complemented by one of Isabella Elder herself further over in the park. Despite the importance of this place it was shockingly refused a Heritage Lottery grant some years ago ndash while many less worthy were not.Exiting the park is done from behind the library, with its splendid cast iron railings, and very fine frontage. The building was designed by another top Glasgow architect, J.J Burnet, and Govanites are proud of the fact they had a public library in  some years before Glasgow built their ious examples. Inside the building are busts of the Elders, and an interesting painting of pre-industrial Govan by Brotchie. This building is also A -Listed.. Moving back eastalong pedesrianised Langlands Road through an assortment of housing built to replace demolished tenements, brings us to Golspie Street, with its stunning ldquoAmsterdam-style new tenement, and then past the car park for the Govan Shopping Centre till we emerge back at Brechinrsquos and the Black Man with a very clear view of the PI. Back at Govan Cross, visit the excellent Cafe . Rest and reflect that you have only scraped the surface of central Govan, never mind Greater Govan...andyou leave unimpressed, there is no hope for you.Ian R Mitchell is the author of Walking through Glasgowrsquos Industrial Past "},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-readers-talking-week","story":"The most revealing section was former Salmond chief adviser Alex Bell saying that when Nicola Sturgeon was put in charge of the referendum campaign \"she rapidly came to the conclusion that much of what Alex Salmond had been saying doesnt stand up to the facts\"He said that \"during the run-up to the referendum Nicola Sturgeon began to see that Salmonds assertions about Scotlands wealth and how it would move on economically were kind of coming apart, and this came to a head in the first Salmond-Darling debate when, in the Green Room she could be seen to be wincing\".Mr Bell has often written that the SNP independence case is \"dead\". The fact that the current First Minister has known it all along and, even worse, the civil service people dragooned into writing and supporting it knew it, is for me a much bigger scandal than what Alex Salmond got up to or Nicola Sturgeons involvement was.The deception and hype from Mr Salmond and his team bloated the Yes result from  per cent at the start to % and have fuelled all the ision, scandal, ridiculous parades and border patrols, neglected government and ravaging uncertainty ever since.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.I WAS stunned by the blatant bias in the documentary The Trial Of Alex Salmond ,which was yet more evidence that the BBC is no longer capable of impartial reporting and that is a tragedy, given its deserved worldwide reputation. It does not augur well for its coverage of a likely second Scottish independence referendum in the near future. Kirsty Wark is a friend of prominent Labour politicians and has holidayed with a former First Minister, Jack McConnell.The documentary bore all the hallmarks of one in production in anticipation of a very dferent verdict which, perhaps, Ms Wark craved. Thirteen High Court jurors, who had heard hours of evidence, it must be remembered, decided that Mr Salmond was not guilty, despite the prosecution having the top QC from the Crown Office. This documentary seemed to fail to grasp this. Why was it even broadcast at the very time the Holyrood inquiry began This whole episode was shameful and I am saddened more than angry. The BBC follows an agenda these days whether it be Brexit, the EU, President Trump, Boris Johnson, Channel migrants, BLM, LGBT, the police, racism, Extinction Rebellion and more. Nothing figures more prominently in that agenda than the preservation of the Union of The United Kingdom. Was this documentary another salvo in that war John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.GIVE TEACHERS A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN REVIEWI AGREE with Denis Brucethat the Governments U-turn on exam results was political: youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds protesting about unfair treatment was not good \"optics\" for the SNP. Speaking as a teacher though, its been disappointing that much of the focus since seems to have been political: \"get that man out of his job\".I had hoped for a wider debate about how we examine our young people the SQAs methods of assessment are much the same as they were for the grandparents of those protesting. In my own subject,  per cent of a students award is determined by a - minute, hand-written exam. A year or two of learning boiling down to that May morning in the exam hall. Its time to look at alternatives.Within the review of SQA procedures, serious consideration should be given into allowing teacher judgment to take a more prominent role. As a matter of course, teachers regularly assess their pupilsto check understanding and progress. Grading of these assessments by teachers could be combined with the SQAs traditional assessment methods to produce a final mark. This would lower the stakes of the end-of-year exam as well as encourage more pupils to engage throughout the academic year, rather than cram at the last minute.Callum Mitchell, Largs.DENIS Bruce is lavish in his criticism of John Swinney, but in writing that Mr Swinney \"has succeeded in ramping up grade inflation, leaving employers and higher institutions wondering whether some of the results are worth the paper they are written on\", he is also insulting the intelligence and professionalism of teachers, employers and those working within the higher institutions.Given all the stramash regarding the grades awarded to young people south of the Border, questions must arise over the intelligence of their Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who might have been expected to learn from and quickly follow Mr Swinneys example, but no Mr Williamson agonisingly strung things along until finally capitulating and executing his U-turn. UK politicians are iniably ignorant about what is happening in Scotland, but perhaps next time Mr Williamson should pay attention he might learn something.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOW that the dust is beginning to settle over the intensely emotional furore over the now notorious algorithmic effect upon exam results, this may well be the right time to reflect rationally upon the purpose of exams for the inidual and the community.For the inidual, an exam tests the competency of the inidual in that area under examination.The result in the exam shows whether the inidual has the capacity to proceed further in that direction, needs to put more effort in to improve in that subject,the inidual wishes to continue with that line, or to seek another area more in keeping with the iniduals talents.For the community which depends upon the ranking order of exam results, such asemployers and higher institutions, exam results provide the opportunity to select those who are best placed to meet the challenges their selection places upon them.To ensure that the results carry credibility, there needs to be a quality control agency to validate nationally the standards of the certicates.If the exams do not produce a satisfactory range of results, their validity would be questionable.Grade inflation comes into that category, posing the question: \"Are the exams too easy, are the examinees cleverer or are the teachers today more effective than their predecessors  \"Ask yourself which of those three sides you would come down upon and you will be well on your way to find out how you would react to another such fiasco as the one we have just experienced.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ACROSS Scotland this past week schools were being closed down amid new outbreaks of Covid-.If we had taken the time during lockdown and during the summer holidays to devise a system of national lesson plans, with a standard national lesson delivered on the same subject at the same time on the same day to the same age group, wouldnt we now be in a position to broadcast these lessons to pupils stuck at home through digital TV  What is so hard about putting lessons on the telly  Wasnt the Open University broadcasting lectures back in the s when we only had three black and white TV channels Nigel Boddy, Darlington.TIME TO TACKLE THE TAKEAWAY CULTUREWHAT a brilliant feature by Joanna Blythman .

The fact that these are ordinary people fleeing from corrupt governments, persecution, brutal attacks and wrongful imprisonment and much more seems to be of no consequence to her.The handling of people sympathetically seems to have been forgotten by governments and businesses. One of the fundamental principles of any person of stature should be \"to do unto others as we would have them do unto us and to be mercul, just and pure\".It is too late when the people have left their oppressive regimes. Governments across the world should join together to take action against these oppressors and forget national interests and stand up to big business who only look at their profit motives.Prevention of the problem arising is the only way to deal with the situation: it is too late to attempt to solve the problem when the people arrive on our shores.Ian Turner, Bearsden.YOUR correspondent Clark Crossin his proposalof a solution for the \"immigrant problem\" ndash to ban all imports from France and suggest that British holidaymakers avoid France ndash is, like the Prime Minister, ignoring inconvenient facts.

When it was rising, interest rates were increased to discourage borrowing and encourage saving thereby reducing the money supply in the system to buy goods and services. The result was prices stabilised and any increases were modest.The converse of that scenario is a reduction in interest rates to encourage spending and investment, which is where we are today. The theory is profit and wealth will be generated to preserve jobs, create new ones through investment and pay down the exceptionally high level of debt resulting from the Covid- epidemic. However, it does not appear to be working.Although base rate is at an all-time low of .%, Bank of England statistics indicate that depositorsrsquo balances are at a record high. Why is this the case The answer is the prevailing climate of fear in the marketplace with members of the public building cash reserves as an insurance against possible loss of employment and companies reluctant to invest in uncertain times.Interest rate policy has been found wanting in the current economic conditions and alternative solutions are now being explored.Lindsay Walker, Strachur.Winning methodsIN his letteron the ways in which noted scholars exercised their discretion in affording passes to students, Iain MacInnes does well to highlight the modus operandi of Professor Magnus Macleanin ensuring students were encouraged to strive harder, or, where circumstances required, to avoid further slippage.It was on Macleanrsquos recommendation also that Reith took his honeymoon in the Parish of Minginish of the professors own forebears in Skye in June  and the future Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland walked with his new bride, Muriel Odhams, from their hotel at Sligachan to the small church at Carbost, where they found the service was in Gaelic.

Harold Wilsonrsquos Labour Government then set up a Royal Commission on the UK constitution in , recommending a devolved Scottish Assembly which was never implemented.The Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed in , comprised of representatives from local government, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Small Business Federation, the Church of Scotland and all political parties except the Conservatives, in an effort to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement. The SNP chose to withdraw from the convention as independence was not a constitutional option, and it subsequently collapsed.Ultimately in  the Labour Government under Tony Blair promised the creation of devolved institutions and a referendum was held later that year and the Scottish Parliament was re-created as a result of the Scotland Act of . Mr Blair therefore was instrumental in firing the starting pistol on the final stretch of the road towards Scottish independence by establishing devolution in an effort to silence the SNP for several generations.When a new state of the art parliament building was built, with many devolved powers granted and a large clutch of MSPs in situ a complete parliamentary machine was gted to the SNP on a plate. The only fly in the ointment is Boris Johnson, who resolutely refuses to grant a Section  order, not to mention the many compelling arguments against the breakup of the Union. On the other hand the BBC has contributed to the recent rise in support for independence by affording Nicola Sturgeon a  to grandstand on national television almost every day for the past five months. I donrsquot blame her for jumping at the chance to place the SNP firmly in front of the nation by leading these sessions and it is plain for all to see that she enjoys basking in the limelight. We all need to be briefed on developments in respect of Covid- but a short bulletin a couple of times per week would suffice.Nevertheless it has taken  years for the SNP fortunes to reach the point where independence could be imminent and it is high time for the Unionists to wake up and become more vocal before the May Holyrood elections precipitate a landslide into oblivion.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.UK press and media cite Business for Scotland Panelbase and Times YouGov August  poll figures respectively of  per cent and % support for Scottish independence. These figures exclude Donrsquot Knows and are partial, inflated \"headline figures\" that provide a basis for misleading reporting.Actual Panelbase and YouGov poll figures respectively show For % and %, Against % and %, Donrsquot Knows % and % . These produce simple averages of For .%, Against .%, Donrsquot Knows %.Support for independence has been rising over , is clearly higher than for remaining within the UK and lies around % . However, whether or not there is majority support for independence is not proven and there has not yet been sustained majority support over a period of time demonstrated for independence. There is therefore no convincing opinion poll case at present to support a second independence referendum. Nor has there been any reversal of the  Referendum   result, contrary to the misleading statement by Business for Scotland .Use of actual poll figures including Donrsquot Knows at the \"headline level\" are essential for objective use of statistics and balance of reporting.Whether or not the Panelbase poll of a % majority for independence continues to be reflected across dferent polls and strengthens over a sustained period of time is an issue, though so also is what happens to the Donrsquot Knows.The level of support for Scotland remaining within the UK has fallen signicantly since  at currently .% , a reflection of Scottish views on Brexit and Conservative governments since  the success of the SNP and First Minister on public perceptions of performance and confusion over UK and Scottish government responsibilities.Dont Knows might well be expected though to vote for the status quo given financial uncertainties and risks. YouGov states \"polling has shown % think the country would be worse off economicallyindependent, compared to % who think better off\". Adding together the above averaged Against and Dont Knows would produce a . .% result against Scottish independence. This is an uncertain proposition that could only be tested in a referendum, but is as much a reasonable proposition for consideration and debate as using partial inflated   and   figures that exclude Donrsquot Knows.John Garrity, Chichester.PETER A Russells concern for Alex Salmond and Scotlands justice systemhas a hollow ring to it, but I agree thatthere was a plot to have Mr Salmond thrown into jail for crimes he did not commit, it is certainly a most serious matter. Surely,anyone has evidence of such a thing the correct procedure would be to immediately contact the police, as the withholding of evidence is also a serious crime.However, I strongly suspect that, in the first place, there is no evidence because there was no plot, and in the second place, that Mr Russells demand for justice to be done is more to do with the latest opinion poll, showing support for Scottish independence now standing at  per cent, rather than any real concern for Mr Salmond and the justice system.Ruth Marr, Stirling.It is touching to witness Peter A Russells eagerness to see Alex Salmond obtain justice for himself and Scotlands criminal justice system. In support, he cites the observations of another two of yesterdays men, Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill.I am afraid that the latter lost a lot of my respect due to his handling of the Al-Megrahi situation. Dr Jim Swire tirelessly pursued the need for a review of the case providing evidence of several flaws in the trial in the Hague carried out under the jurisdiction of the Scottish justice system. Mr MacAskill refused to accept that there was any doubt as to Al-Megrahis guilt and he defended the Crown Prosecution services evidence virtually without question. Thereafter, he could not arrange the transfer of the convicted man to Libya quickly enough. This may well have been the start of the downturn of his own political career.It saddens me that Mr Salmond and the others cannot accept their diminished influence in the SNP and appear intent on undermining the cause of independence that they have worked so hard to deliver. The former party leader has been cleared of all charges against him even though his reputation has been tarnished by some of his own admissions during the trial. He has little to gain from washing any dirty linen in public, an outcome which Mr Russell is clearly hoping will damage the cause of independence which he hates so much.Gordon Evans, Burnside.I PREFACE my comments by saying there is no acceptable level for crimes against the person including sexual assault and rape. However, itrsquos appalling and a sad indictment of pathetic state of the opposition at Holyrood that Tory MSPS Liam Kerr would attempt to make political capital out of a blip in Julyrsquos sexual crime statistics . When taken in conjunction with the previous three months the levels of sexual crimes are actually substantially reduced.If Mr Kerr believes Police Scotland is underfunded then perhaps he could do something constructive and ask his masters in Westminster to increase the Block Grant after all what Westminster begrudgingly gives Holyrood to run the country is less than half the revenue generated in Scotland.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ON Friday Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard delivered a keynote speech, unveiling plans to transform the Scottish economy.

All Mr Leonardrsquos proposals were taken forward in the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Budget when the SNP set aside pound. billion of capital investment in projects to reduce emissions, investment in electric vehicles and extended free bus travel to under-s.

The Prince of Darkness is not renowned for making concessions. Irsquom sure both Mr Gove and Mr Galloway will forgive meI suggest that, for some, the identity of Auld Nick in this esoteric coupling may be subject to perpetual speculation.The Twitter alliance of these seemingly irreconcilable political foes has been born of mounting Unionist fears over the break up of the United Kingdom. Two more opinion polls this week continued an extended recent trend in favour of independence with one indicating an all-time high of % for Yes.Mr Gove, unofficial minister for the Union Jack in Boris Johnsonrsquos hard-right cabinet, has thus been seeking cross-party allies for what is likely to be Britainrsquos last imperial battle. According to the London Times, he has already held discussions with Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodaleand Danny Alexander, the former Liberal-Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury.When Mr Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Great Britain, suggested this week that the ldquo, Scots living where in the UK must have a vote in the second referendum on independence Mr Gove replied ldquointeresting question. Mr Galloway at least possesses that rare commodity in British politics: principles.He might well have enjoyed a stellar career near the top of British politics were it not for his habit of reminding assorted Labour leaders how to spell S-O-C-I-A-L-I-S-T. Presumably, hersquoll defend his present dalliance with Mr Gove, a man who once apologised for participating in a strike, on the grounds that nationalism in whatever form is the enemy of international socialism. Butyour beliefs drive you into a camp led by one who has built his career abjuring everything you hold to be dear then perhaps you might ask yourself what it was you thought you were fighting for all this time.Mr Goversquos fireside chats with the laird of Glencorrosdaleare much easier to understand. Lord McConnell and his brother Labour barons were chiefly responsible for reducing Labour in Scotland to its current status of Holder of the Jaikets. In this wretched period the party has come to be defined not by its commitment to the communities that once nurtured it but by its alliance with the Conservative and Unionist Party.Irsquom also intrigued by Mr Gallowayrsquos late attempt to gerrymander the boundaries for a future referendum. In the six years since the last independence referendum Unionists have cited the ldquopeople of Scotland in their claims of a once-in-a-generation event. Irsquom interested to know by what geographical contortion an address in Dorset can now be considered to be ldquoof Scotland.Letrsquos leave aside for the moment concerns about being over-optimistic at the shiny Yes numbers. As Irsquove suggested previously, we are living in abnormal times when the usual scrutiny of a partyrsquos domestic policy record has been suspended. And be in no doubt, when the second independence referendum does begin the British state will deploy every artice and lever at its disposal to maintain Westminster rule.Itrsquos now apparent, though, that the Yes cause is building momentum over a prolonged period of time. It would be tempting to ascribe this merely to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquopresentationalrsquo skills and Boris Johnsonrsquos lack of them. Certainly, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that the First Ministerrsquos leadership has been a factor in the recent numbers for independence. If you can trust the nationrsquos leader when a pandemic threatens your existence then trusting her when she makes the economic and cultural cause for independence would not seem to be the massive leap it was in .There is something  at play here. Itrsquos become clear that from the lived experience of coronavirus has sprung a desire for profound and lasting societal change at many levels. One of the strongest suits of Better Together in  was the perception of stability. Many who had seriously considered voting for independence ultimately recoiled from taking a step into the unknown and a future uncertain. But when our immediate andlong-term future is wreathed in uncertainty the perceived risks of self-determination recede a little.During the five months of lockdown many have found that those institutions they once looked to for security and stability have let them down or revealed to have been a mirage. They have seen officials at the top of the Westminster Government recklessly disregard lockdown restrictions with impunity and disregard for the safety of the nation. They have come to discover that being locked out of Britainrsquos affluence means you are three times likelier to die of Covid- than those you entrusted with your health and wellbeing.From the outset of this pandemic they have witnessed the worst excesses of the capitalist system that gives oxygen to the forces now telling them to preserve the Union at any cost. They now know that those who always tell them ldquowe are all in it together wasted no time in saying ldquoyoursquore on your own when super-rich shareholders demanded redundancies to protect their idends. At the first hint of trouble after years of massive profits the lowest-paid workers were first to be thrown overboard. And they know too that lsquoemergency fundingrsquo means large quantities of cash being handed to the families and friends of UK ministers for sub-standard protective equipment and no questions asked.Britain during coronavirus has been exposed as a vicious little gangster state and this is what George Galloway and Lord McConnell are being duped into defending.

But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same.

The polls in  showing Yes at over  per cent. The ldquosurge in SNP membership. The marches. All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.The second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.And therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then. But there are signs of change and as soon as therersquos an indication that the coronavirus effect is sticking or that support for independence is reaching beyond the hard core, thatrsquos when the momentum could really get going. Thatrsquos when % could become an achievable goal. Thatrsquos when independence will become unstoppable.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The online programme sees researchers and scientists explore a range of topics including space technology, mental health, cancer research, video games, language and articial intelligence.Dundee University researcher Dr Senga Robertson-Albertynrsquos talk will look at how improving food quality and availability could lie beneath the soil, in plants roots and their unique biome systems.ldquoMicrobes wonrsquot save the world one microbe at a time, this isnrsquot a magic bullet. But it does have global implications, said Dr Robertson-Albertyn, who is working on how plant microbiomes in spinach and tomatoes could be tailored to improve quality, productivity, safety and sustainability.ldquoBy tweaking the plantrsquos microbiome, we could help it be more successful as a crop, or not require as much chemical input.ldquoIt could lead to improved yields using microbes to help plants take up nutrients more effectively, and improve the quality of food.Plants have their own microbiome that has evolved over millions of years. However, breeding to create larger yields or boost the size of fruit or grains, along with the use of fertilisers and pesticides have left an impact on how plants recruit important bacteria and affected the balance of microbes in the soil in which theyrsquore grown.Itrsquos hoped that by unravelling the way plants recruit microbes and introducing ways to encourage a more effective uptake of the lsquohealthyrsquo bacteria, plants can go on to thrive without the need for potentially damaging chemicals.ldquoWe have lost a lot of genetic ersity that impacts on what they recruit bacterially, added Dr Robertson-Albertyn. ldquoWe want to readjust it by adding microbes to plant when put in the ground to help them enrich what they were.She added the technology could be particularly useful in areas where farmers do not have access to fertiliser or pesticides which could increase their yield, or where soil conditions are particularly poor or overworked.ldquoThe importance of microbes in plants is becoming more apparent, particularly in light of work on the human gut, she added. ldquoThere are many people now researching plant microbiomes and how we can tweak the microbiome to help the plant be more successful or not require as much chemical input.While bacteria inoculant treatments are available which can be added to plantsrsquo soil, often by the time they get to the plants they donrsquot work because they have to compete with hundreds of thousands of other bacteria present in the soil.ldquoYou canrsquot just throw bacteria at a plant and expect them to accept it, she added.ldquoWhen you look at adding microbes around the roots of plant, itrsquos not that you are trying to change or improve the relationship between plants and microbes that has evolved over millions of years, she added.ldquoItrsquos trying to repair some of the changes through breeding and plant management that have altered the way plants are reacting to microbes, and repairing plants to get them back to how they used to be.ldquoIt is a bit like going back to the future.Can We Get to the Root of Things  on August , is part of the RSE Curious programme. https:www.rse-curious"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-ronald-mcdonald-house-receives-donations-book-club-saw-online-members-soar-lockdown","story":"WITH lockdown offering people the chance to catch up on their reading, a Scottish book club saw their membership grow by more than.However, now the Edinburgh-based Rare Birds Book Club is giving something back and has donated a collection of books to a charity which supports families with free home away from home accommodation to families while their child is in hospital.The monthly book delivery and digital book club sends over  books to Ronald McDonald House in Glasgow.During the lockdown period, Rare Birds Book Club reported a  per cent growth, taking the subscription service and digital book club from , subscribers per month to more than ,.Wanting to show its appreciation for customersrsquo ongoing support during such unprecedented times - times which saw many small businesses collapse ndash founder Rachel Wood decided to give back to a community that had a connection with Rare Birds.

It proposed further extraction of stone from the quarry as well as landscaping and restoration on the site.This was the second hearing of this application by the planning committee. A decision had previously been deferred, pending a site visit by councillors.Consideration was given by committee members to the proposal made by the development and infrastructure department, as well as the concerns raised by objectors. Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

The cub, who will not be named for its first hundred days in accordance with tradition, will remain in the den for its first few months of le.For now it is pink and hairless the distinctive black and white fur markings come later.Meanwhile father Tian Tian seems blissfully oblivious, rolling around his outdoor enclosure Saturday morning.Giant pandas are almost entirely solitary, and in the wild it would be normal for Tian Tian to never meet his offspring.### Keepers report that giant panda Mei Xiang and her newborn had a successful first night.

that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and

our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

On the question over face masks, Mr Todd said: Face coverings have been mandatory in indoor retail premises in Northern Ireland since August .In that time, retailer groups and representatives are reporting approximately  to % compliance, which is a signicant step in the right direction.Inevitably, the first steps in encouraging compliance will fall to the public themselves and to transport operators and businesses.Police will continue to work with transport operators and businesses, directing resources to areas of identied need and will continue to do so on the basis of the four #Es# Engage-Explain-Encourage-Enforce.Each and every one of us has a personal responsibility to follow the NI Executive regulations and do everything we can to stop the spread of Covid-. In line with health advice we would encourage everyone to comply with the health regulations to help keep people safe.The chair of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland Mark Lindsay said everything will be done to support the officers who have been affected by the outbreak.A welfare hub is in operation to support our colleagues at this time, he stated.Elsewhere, Ross Park Hotel in Ballymena said it was notied by a young member of its part-time staff that he had tested positive for Covid-.The person had worked in the premises on Wednesday and showed no symptoms upon his arrival. He is now self-isolating.Ross Park#s Keith Carmichael said the hotel is being deep cleaned, adding: We have made this public knowledge straight away for guidance of both our customers and staff.Questions we put to PSNI over Covid-...What areas of policing do the officers with Covid- work in  For example, response or detective roles  How many people work in Antrim and Newtownabbey police stations How many officers who work in Antrim and Newtownabbey have been redeployed to work in other stations How was a decision reached with regards to who should self-isolate  What risk assessment was carried out to assess who should self-isolate  Did the PSNI advise officers to self-isolate or was the decision made by the Public Health Agency Test Trace Protect staff If response officers are among those who have been diagnosed, have their entire sections been told to isolate or inidual officers been told to self-isolate Was anyone in the dedicated Covid response team diagnosed with Covid- Has the PSNI established whether there is a link between the eight positive cases and has the cause of the spread been established  If so, what is the reason  For example, were they in a crew together Does the PSNI have a policy on hotdesking, particularly for response officers  If so, what it is Have any officers who were shielding been ed to work in Antrim or Newtownabbey stations, or any other stations in Northern Ireland Belfast Most ReadMI#s New IRA sting cuts head off the snake Jealous bullies forced me out of area over my glamorous home, says Belfast womanCompany director a Covid convict: NI businesswoman jailed for Isle of Man rule breach picturedConvicted robber tried to sell Noah Donohoe#s laptop for cash - unaware it belonged to tragic schoolboyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further Covid deaths - but  more cases confirmed,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"a victory to savour but how could sinn fein get it so wrong","story":"descriptionpinPlease confirm to access your content OK\",template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricesSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_summary_coupon_code: \"Coupon Codecoupon_validationRedeem Code\",template_summary_coupon_code_applied: \"\",template_premium_fadeout: \"\",template_redeem_coupon_code: Redeem your SubscriptionEnter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

She said: Not all civil servants had the ITin the initial few weeks however, over a relatively short period of time thousands of civil servants were provided with the appropriate IT to allow them to work from home.In the main the vast majority are working effectively from home using their employer-provided IT. It is not ideal. However, from a health and safety perspective Nipsa would fully support home-working given the rise in the R number, and the fact that the Executive and PHA guidance states that where you can work from home, you should continue to work from home. Home is the safest place to be at the moment.The Department of Finance said: The number of staff who can safely work within our offices has been considerably reduced to comply with social distancing, which has proven to be the most effective means of preventing the spread of the virus. Throughout this crisis, our staff have worked remotely to ensure the provision of vital services and support to a wide range of people, including those members of society and businesses impacted by Covid-. Over , laptops were purchased and associated software to support remote working including video conferencing and increased network capacity to ensure the continuation of public services including payment of benefits and other vital government services throughout the duration of the crisis. This unprecedented sht to remote working in the NICS has had the effect of enabling the workforce to be more flexible, working remotely and delivering new ways of working that has the potential in the longer term to deliver savings on office accommodation and improve productivity.

It says that actual losses to the sector here stand at £.m for the last six months alone but it warns that the figure is likely to reach double that by the end of the yearA statement says: To compound matters further, many arts organisations which rely heavily on income generated through box office, a model decimated by social distancing, are now facing a socially distanced Christmas season ahead, normally one of the most profitable times of year for the arts.The hugely popular Grand Opera House pantomime, which had been due to star May McFettridge in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, has been postponed for a year after Covid- delayed work on a massive refurbishment programme.Officials at the Millennium Forum in Derry Londonderry have also postponed their panto, Sleeping Beauty, for  months.The ACNI says it has been working closely with the Department for Communities to support arts organisation, inidual artists and freelances whose work in the creative sector has been decimated.The council says it and the Department have put together a series of emergency funding initiatives.But the ACNI warned: Short term measures now will not save the arts and entertainment infrastructure nor many of those who work within it, from artists to lighting technicians, drivers to musicians. Their work has completely disappeared and the future is uncertain.It is crucial that the arts and creative sectors are supported and sustained with further investment now and over the coming years in order to plan and deliver arts programming - programming and activities that are so important to our night time economy, to cultural tourism and to the health and wellbeing of the many iniduals most in need in our communities.The ACNI says that assistance for the arts has included: l Fty per cent of the £.m in annual core grants being paid up front to support  key arts organisations in April .l Two hundred and twenty four funding awards being made to inidual artists, totalling £,, in May June  through the Artists Emergency Programme .l The opening of the Iniduals Emergency Resilience Programmein July, worth £.m from the Department for Communities and from Future Screens NI, offering grants to iniduals working in the creative sector. l One hundred and fty funding awards being made to arts organisations, totalling £.m, through the Organisations Emergency Programme , with a second round of the programme opening soon.l The imminent opening of a capital funding programme to help arts organisations prepare for a safe reopening of venues and performance spaces.The ACNI has already said it is continuing to press government for parity of esteem in public investment in the arts here, to close the gap on spending per head of the population in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic.Last week Game of Thrones and Derry Girls star Ian McElhinney called for more government and ACNI backing for struggling actors and technicians and said he hoped funds would be directed at professionals in the industry rather than being erted to community projects.

He said he would keep the matter under review. The EA said there had been a much more positive financial outturn for the most recent financial year, ending in April.Details of the overspend emerged in a recent report by the Northern Ireland Audit Office, which examined the EA#s   accounts. The EA#s budget is approved by the Department of Educationand the Department for the Economy .Mr Donnelly states: DE provided a budget for education services of £,m for  . The EA#s actual spend on education services in the period was £,.m, resulting in an overspend of £.m. There were underspends on student and further education support services funded by DfE and on youth services funded by DE. This meant the overall overspend by the EA was £.m in  .The EA said extra was spent on Special Educational Needs , rates , transport , increases in schools# deficits , and headquarter costs . The body had also exceeded its budget by £.m in   and by £.m in  .In his report, Mr Donnelly writes: The EA advised me that the issues which led to overspends in education services since   are still prevalent today, and are reflective of the signicant financial pressures facing the education sector, with pay and price increases being unfunded for the past five years, combined with growing service pressures across the educational sector. He adds: On this basis, EA further advised the budget for   did not take into account pay and price inflationary pressures and did not fully meet pressures from increased demand. EA also highlighted that the deficit position was mitigated to some degree by savings of £m achieved in the period, bringing the total savings delivered since   to £.m. EA told me that given the scale of the challenges facing the education sector, the EA is focused on developing a longer term strategic recovery plan to address the EA#s and schools# financial stability and sustainability. This is a signicant undertaking that will fundamentally shape the scale and scope of service delivery to schools, children and young people for a generation and it is anticipated that it will take a period of three to five years to ensure that the appropriate arrangements can be fully considered, evidenced, consulted upon and implemented.In October  the Audit Office reported on the financial health of schools, which noted the number of schools operating in deficit. In his latest report, Mr Donnelly added: It is concerning that the number of schools which are in deficit continues to increase, with the EA reporting that the number increased from  in  to  in   . These figures exclude voluntary grammars and grant maintained integrated schools.The EA developed a new approach towards schools# financial planning in  . This included undertaking financial health checks of schools and identying ways to reduce spending. However, Mr Donnelly said the benefits of this work may not be evident for another year or more. He added: Whilst I acknowledge the financial pressures education funding is under, it is important that the EA lives within its budget. An EA spokesperson said: The education sector continues to face a range of financial pressures and we have been working closely with the Department of Education to manage these pressures. During the   financial year, the Minister for Education secured additional funding of over £m and we delivered further cost savings in excess of £m.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack. Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war.

German bombers swarmed the skies. Belfast bore the brunt of a -strong Luftwaffe squadron, with  dead and , injured as a result. Seventy miles up the road, Derry was hit only once. It was not the Germans’ planned target. Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War. Messines Park was named after the  Battle of Messines, in which the thDivision and thDivision had fought side by side. The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. googletag.cmd.push Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for pound,-- - pound, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around pound per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack.Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign. After being taken prisoner at Bertencourt, he was held in prisoner of war camps in Le Quesnoy Limburg and Dulman, before being discharged as ‘no longer physically fit for war service’ in . Johnand his we Winred , along with their children Owenand Bridgetdied during the Messines Park attack and were buried in Derry City Cemetery.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of. We are nearly double that of the next lowest council. Six councils are in single figures, and there is no reason why we at Newry, Mourne and Down should be any worse.ldquoI have four dogs of my own, three of which are rescues, and as a huge animal lover this shatters me.ldquoI fully appreciate that there are some dogs that are unsuitable for rehoming due to aggression or illness, but I fail to understand why we have had to destroy  in one year mdash thatrsquos almost one a week.Cllr Owen says she has had a ldquoconstructive conversation with the councilrsquos head of licensing and enforcement and asked for a dialogue to begin with other councils.ldquoIt would be helpful to see what we can learn and implement in our district in the future, she continued.ldquoThere is no need for us to reinvent the wheelother councils are already being successful, we should follow their model.She added: ldquoI would like to recognise the hard work done by Ards and North Down Council in conjunction with Lost and Found Pets North Down Ards Rescue and Rehoming.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said it worked closely with animal welfare colleagues in the management of its dog control service.He said the council received a total of  unwanted and stray dogs between April  and March .ldquoThis is the second largest total of dogs received across all Northern Ireland councils over this reporting period, he said.ldquoWhile recognising the figure for the destruction of dogs appears high, the council have reduced the number of dogs humanely destroyed over this period, from  in ,  in  to  in .The spokesman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council promotes responsible dog ownership and through public awareness it is hoped that this will further reduce the number of dogs sent for humane destruction in the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Alan.jpg","title":"Alan shares his love of wide open spaces%2C travel and sports  ","story":"A LIFETIME ago Ballynahinch Camera Club vice-chairman Alan Chowney thought he would continue with his love of painting, which he first practiced in school.Alanrsquos artistic efforts did not always capture what he wanted to show, despite many hoursrsquo work, and so he drted away from painting with the intention of ing to it in later le.When he started his working career he got seriously interested in cameras.

There were growing reports of teenage parties after this time, because there is only so long that people will accept massive restrictionsThe chief medical officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire, said he would recommend such sweeping restrictionsCovid- infections hit  people per , .Robin Swann, the health minister, also gave warning that ato lockdown could not be ruled out,cases keep rising.Dr McBride, as a health official who lacks an elected mandate, was careful to say that it was not ultimately his call. He said that any recommendations would “need to go to the executive at the appropriate time for them to make a decision”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That is the traditional protocol. Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It says: “The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.ChildrenWe are confident that multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the le chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout the le course including employment. It has not been possible to reduce societal inequalities through the provision of home-based education alone. School attendance is very important for children and young people.Live samples in test tubes are held in a containerWe are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from COVID-. The infection fatality ratefor those aged  to  is estimated at  per million, lower than for most seasonal flu infections. Every death of a child is a tragedy but COVID- deaths in children and teenagers are fortunately extremely rare and almost all deaths are in children with signicant pre-existing health conditions.We are confident that there is clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, eventhey catch COVID-. The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be .% for children aged  to  and .% among those aged  to , compared to a hospitalisation rate of over % in the UK for the general population. Most of these children make a rapid recovery.We are confident that there is clear evidence from many studies that the great majority of children and teenagers who catch COVID- have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.There is reasonable, but not yet conclusive, evidence that primary school age children have a signicantly lower rate of infection than adults .Evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching COVID- is mixed. They are either less likely to catch COVID- than adults or have the same risk as adults.Transmission of COVID- to children in schools does occur. On current evidence it is probably not a common route of transmission. It may be lower in primary age children than secondary age children.Control measures such as hand and surface hygiene, cohorting to reduce number of daily contacts, and directional controls to reduce face-to-face contact remain key elements of maintaining COVID- secure school environments and minimising risk.Children and young people who were previously shielding were identied on a precautionary basis at a stage when we had less data on the effects of COVID- in children than we do now. Based on our better understanding of COVID- the great majority have now been advised they do not need to do so again, and that they shouldto school. A small number of children under paediatric carehave been or will be given inidual advice about any ongoing need to avoid infection.Our overall consensus is that, compared to adults, children may have a lower risk of catching COVID- , definitely have a much lower rate of hospitalisation and severe disease, and an exceptionally low risk of dying from COVID-. Very few,any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID- due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.Teachers, other school staff and parentsData from the UKsuggest teachers are not at increased risk of dying from COVID- compared to the general working-age population. ONS data identies teaching as a lower risk profession . International data support this.Transmission of COVID- to staff members in school does occur, and data from UK and international studies suggest it may largely be staff to staffrather than pupil to staff. This reinforces the need to maintain social distancing and good infection control inside and outside classroom settings, particularly between staff members and between older children and adults.If teachers, other school staff, parents or wider family catch COVID- their risks of severe illness are similar to those of other adults of the same age, ethnicity and health status. Younger adults have a much lower risk of severe COVID- than older adults. The greatest risk is to those over  years old.Current international evidence suggests transmission of COVID- from children of school age to parents or other adult family members is relatively rare compared to transmission from adults, but this evidence is weak. Teenagers may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children.Children and young people should be engaged in the process of establishing COVID- secure measures as key participants and promoters of safe communities to help protect their wider families, teachers and other school staff and other social networks. This will help reduce the risk of school outbreaks.Impact of opening schools on wider transmission Because schools connect households it is likely opening schools will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely and therefore increase R. We have confidence in the current evidence that schools are much less important in the transmission of COVID- than for influenza or some other respiratory infections. Other work and social environments also increase risk and are likely to be more important for transmission of COVID-.The international real-world evidence suggests that reopening of schools has usually not been followed by a surge of COVID- in a timescale that implies schools are the principal reason for the surge. There has, however, not been sufficient time to say this with confidence.On the other hand, a local or national surge in transmission in the community may lead to an increased risk of school outbreaks occurring.Opening schools may be as important in linking households indirectly as through direct transmission in school. For example allowing parents to go back to work, or meeting at the school gates, on public transport or in shared private vehicles, via after school social or sport activities or wrap-around care may be as important as what happens within the school.It is possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above  having previously been below it, at least in some local areas. This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on dferent parts of the community and the economy.Early identication and quickly managing outbreaks of COVID- in schools is essential as part of a local response to COVID-. Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safeto schools”.Earlier it was revealed that the number of PSNI officers now affected by COVID- is now .A Tweet this afternoon said: “Update from ACC Todd in relation to Covid- and our officers. The number of officers who are currently self-isolating and undergoing testing for Covid- has increased from  yesterday to  officers today”.The news comes as a servive took place for tragic Andreea Maftei in Ballymena.The -year-old who had worked in Nobel cafe in Ballymena dies last week.Today her family and friends gathered to say their final goodbyesTributes were paid to Andreea last week and flowers were placed outside the cafe alongside candles.A notice on the James Henry Funeral Services social media page said: “Andreea Maftei, th August , passed away suddenly at Antrim Area Hospital after a short illness aged .‘Late of  Ballyloughan Park, Ballymena.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better. This virus can and has taken lives”Minister Swann said recently his department recently has been dealing “with a signicant outbreak in a meat processing plant”.He said  cases were detected in staff and further cases of contact. He said all staff were being tested and many were self-isolating.Dr McBride added that “theof schools could see pressure on the R number”.“If your child has symptoms then keep them at home,” he added. “Get them tested. The capacity is up to  tests a day. Schools are not unsafe places.”The news came in the latest Department of Health dashboard - which also revealed that now , people have tested positive in Northern Ireland.In the last seven days  people have tested positive in Northern Ireland.There are no further deaths leaving the toll at .Most of the  confirmed coronavirus cases recorded in the past  hours by the Department of Health have been aged between -.Twenty-five of the  cases recorded were in that age range.The fewest cases recorded in the department’s latest update were between the ages  - and -.The latest dashboard reveals that the majority of the  cases of coronavirus confirmed within the last  hours were recorded in the Mid and East Antrim and Belfast council areas - both with .The remainder of cases confirmed in the Department of Health’s were located in:Antrim and Newtownabbey - Lisburn and Castlereagh- Newry Mourne and Down - Armagh Banbridge and Craigavon- Causeway Coast and Glens - Derry and Strabane - Mid-Ulster - The biggest increase in cases over a seven-day-period has occurred in Mid and East Antrim with  new cases.The dashboard also reveals there are active Covid- outbreaks in eight Northern Ireland care homes.That is an increase of seven from yesterday.An active outbreak is declared in a care home when a resident or staff member has a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Covid-.The news comes as it emerges a meat processing plant near Ballymena is to close temporarily due to a Covid cluster.Cranswick in Cullybackey, which processes pigs, will shut at the weekend, the BBC have reported.A cluster is defined as  or more cases.

In response, we have already put additional measures in place.Last week, we moved to the next phase of our agreed, comprehensive Hygiene Commitment plan which includes increased random testing of team members, who continue to operate within team bubbles.In addition, we are also the first company in Northern Ireland to introduce a Mistpal Cleansing Tunnel for team members and guests entering the Resort for further safety reassurance. This is in addition to already established measures including a nightly, full deep-clean of all areas with hospital-grade sanitiser protectant and decontamination equipment, thermal temperature monitoring, provision of hand sanitisers in all areas and adherence to recommended social distancing guidelines.The health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and we are grateful for their continued support and also to those guests who have rescheduled their stay as a result of the robust pre-entry testing measures we have in place.”Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has already carried out tests with almost  team members and will continue to conduct random testing and adopt the same stringent protocols already in place in the event that any further positive cases are identied.Since reopening Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has been focused on safety as a priority and was among the first hotels in the UK to receive the AA COVID Confident Mark for its industry leading health and safety standards.
