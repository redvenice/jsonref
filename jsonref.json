We used to be able to walk along the footpath where there was just a chain link fence so you could see the lake the laurel trees in their garden.\u0027Now there\u0027s that 7ft high fence blocking our view of the garden, which is outside their boundary and is not at all in keeping with the local area. It\u0027s offensive.\u0027In a letter to the local council, neighbour Laura Lauro wrote: \u0027I strongly object to the fence it is much too high, it has been erected without permission, without consulting the people living in the area very obstructively on the footpath, narrowing it considerably and with no consideration for the historic value of the footpath and completely ignoring the gloomy effect it has on it.\u0027Another resident, Julia Russell, added: \u0027The new fence has blighted the landscape. Most importantly, it narrows and darkens the footpath to such an extent that children and dogs are at risk from cyclists suddenly appearing from around the bend.\u0027In another letter of objection, neighbours known only as Mr and Mrs Aubury wrote: \u0027Whilst we fully understand the applicant\u0027s desire for privacy, the fence as it stands negatively affects the view from our property.              The row centres on a 130ft-long wooden fence (pictured) erected next to a footpath that runs along the side of Burton\u0027s home which ramblers say narrows the path and blocks out light         The wooden fence, erected in September, next to the Thames (pictured) has replaced a chain link fence to keep out prying eyes of walkers using the path and looking into the garden          The new fence at the property was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later and now been granted despite protests by the local council         The grand property (pictured) was once owned by Bonham Carter\u0027s ancestor Asquith, the prime minister who took Britain into the First World War, where he lived until his death in 1932 \u0027This fence materially affects the character and appearance of this part of the conservation area. The fence has replaced a previously green meshed wire fence which blended with its surroundings and effectively demarcated the boundary.\u0027While another neighbour added: \u0027I used to be able to walk along the path with my friend side-by-side but now one of us has to walk behind the other.\u0027The path narrows as it bends round and you can find yourself quite close to the banks of the river.\u0027The fence was put up last year to protect the owner\u0027s privacy and prevent walkers using the footpath that runs alongside the house from looking into the garden.It was put up without planning permission which was sought retrospectively two months later.And despite complaints from ramblers and neighbours to the property planning permission has now been granted.They also conceded that although the new fence had been built in front of the old one and reduced the width of the footpath, there was no legally-recorded width for the path.Case officer Kerry Street said in her report: \u0027Given the distance of the fence to the nearest properties, and the river that separates them, there will be no detrimental harm to these properties through either loss of light, overlooking or over-shadowing.         Bonham Carter 54, and Burton were together for 13 years before they split.

Its owner for 30 years before being sold to Burton, Jane Stevens, served as lady-in-waiting to the late Princess Margaret, who was also a close friend.More recently Johnny Depp is believed to have sought solace there with his friends Bonham Carter and Burton following the bitter fallout from his orce from Amber Heard.Bonham Carter and Burton split in 2014 after 13 years together.

And Cook\u0027s diminutive comedy partner, Dudley Moore.The pair would pace round the garden writing sketches, trying out jokes and, increasingly, rubbing each other up the wrong way as Moore sought Hollywood success while Cook embraced a quiet life with triple vodka and orange for breakfast.It was at a Perrin\u0027s Walk party that a dripping wet Cook greeted his guests by explaining he had just jumped into the koi carp pond after setting his trousers on fire while lighting candles.         Perrins Walk is a charming private mews and is perfectly located for the Hampstead Village lifestyle, according to a recent listing         Dudley Moore and Peter Cook standing in the backyard of the famous party house Cook\u0027s daughters Daisy and Lucy, from his first wife Wendy, occasionally lent a hand. \u0027I remember asking Keith Richards what he\u0027d like to drink. \u0027Whisky!\u0027 he commanded,\u0027 Daisy said. \u0027As I returned with a glass, he looked at me blankly and said: \u0027I meant a bottle.\u0027When an admiring Ronnie Wood asked his host who the waitress was, Cook sharply responded: \u0027That\u0027s my daughter — hands off!\u0027Cook himself welcomed a steady stream of women. Indeed, it was here, hidden in a suitcase upstairs in the master bedroom, that second wife Judy Huxtable spied on her husband, trying to catch him in flagrante.If she\u0027d been pushed to the edge, it was no surprise. For Cook had a voracious appetite for women and was not the sort to let a little detail like wives — three of them, to be precise — get in the way of a bit of extracurricular fun.         Peter Cook and his wife Judy Huxtable. Cooked lived in the party house from 1974 until his death from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage in 1995, aged 57         Everyone who was anyone seems to have partied at Perrin\u0027s Walk — the Pythons Stephen Fry, David Gower, Dave Stewart, the Rolling Stones. And Cook\u0027s diminutive comedy partner, Dudley Moore (pictured together)Over the years, he bedded a vast array of beauties including President J.F. Kennedy\u0027s wife, Jackie, and her sister, Lee Radziwill.When famous women such as Germaine Greer visited, he would flirt furiously. He also whisked Hollywood actress Raquel Welch and Bond Girl Ursula Andress out for the evening, leaving poor old Judy shell-shocked, at home.Peter Cook, the son of an economics adviser to the government, was brilliant, funny and original.He was at Cambridge at the same time as future Tory grandees Michael Howard, Leon Brittan and Kenneth Clarke and knew them all vaguely.\u0027They were all so self-important at 20, that you\u0027d have thought they\u0027d have grown out of it. But no . . .\u0027 he said.         British comedians Peter Cook (1937 - 1995) and Dudley Moore (1935 - 2002) with guitarist Keith Richards and singer-songwriter Kenny Lynch at the release party for the uncut version of \u0027Derek and Clive Get the Horn\u0027, UK, 6th September 1993Yet he and Dudley Moore were also deeply ambitious. For two decades, everything they did shone. Their sketch revue, Beyond The Fringe, with Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller, was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Cook and Moore then cemented their partnership with the BBC TV series Not Only . . . But Also.They were superstars who slept with endless women and, in Cook\u0027s case, drank far too much.They finally went their separate ways after a world tour in 1974. Moore was drawn to the Hollywood lights, while Cook headed back to Hampstead where two years\u0027 mail awaited. He refused to open any of it.In fact, he never opened any mail ever again. Instead, he focused on a life of shambolic indolence punctuated by lavish parties. With the royalties pouring in from 20 years of performances, he didn\u0027t need to work — and that was fine by him. He was, he once said, \u0027born to be on holiday\u0027.         Dudley Moore, Peter Cook and Judy Huxtable during Party for Arnold Weisberger\u0027s Book \u0027Famous Faces\u0027 - December 3, 1973 at Pub Theatrical in New York CityHe certainly felt like that when he became friends with Victor Lownes, head of the British ision of the Playboy Club, and discovered Bunny girls and a whole new level of \u0027sexual goings on\u0027.It marked the end of his marriage to Judy. But he quickly started a relationship with Lin Chong, who worked as a secretary for Lownes and lived just 200 yards from Cook. She took one look at the state of his house and decided they should be a \u0027two-home\u0027 couple. In turn, he promised to limit his lovers to his two favourite girlfriends. Somehow they made it work.Cook adored his home and spent a lot of time in his sitting room, reading every newspaper, chatting with his neighbour, George Weiss, who recorded hundred of hours of their meandering conversations.At night, he\u0027d call radio stations, putting on different personas. For two years, for example, he managed to fool thousands of listeners by calling a phone-in show pretending to be a Norwegian fisherman called Sven who was pining for his fish.But there were terrible lows. In 1986 he was given a car for his birthday and promptly crashed it into a police car while over the limit. The following year, he ended up in a newspaper kiss-and-tell story by a former girlfriend, alleging group sex at Weiss\u0027s house.          Keith Richards, Peter Cook (1937 - 1995), Ronnie Wood, Dudley Moore (1935 - 2002), and Dave Stewart at the release party for the uncut version of \u0027Derek and Clive Get the Horn\u0027Meanwhile, his daily drinking escalated to three bottles of wine, a bottle of vodka and numerous glasses of strong lager a day.No one seemed to mind, because the drunker he got, the funnier he became. Of course, his health suffered.Many people said he\u0027d failed to fulfil his potential. But he didn\u0027t care. For Cook was utterly uninterested in projecting the \u0027right\u0027 image, claiming that he lost all ambition by the age of 24.\u0027I might have some regrets but I can\u0027t remember what they are,\u0027 he famously commented.After he died, Lin finally moved into Perrin\u0027s Walk — and couldn\u0027t bear to change a thing. Not even the graffiti or piles of stuff everywhere. In fact, according to her brother, Chiew Chong, Lin, who died in 2016, added to it.\u0027Peter and Lin were both hoarders,\u0027 he said.This week, the Heath \u0026amp Hampstead Society will adorn the house with a commemorative plaque.It is a nice gesture, but, following a refurbishment project that took more than two years, it is almost impossible to marry this sanitised substitute with Cook\u0027s louche party palace."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/11/00/14624390-0-image-m-77_1560209755135.jpg","title":"Childrens books written include modern genetics","story":"Share this article Mr Twit in Roald Dahl\u0027s classic book The Twits could have tested his spaghetti to discover the disgusting trick his wife had played on him by hiding worms in it.But Enid Blyton\u0027s much-loved Famous Five and Secret Seven would have benefited most from some scientific help, had the books unfortunately not been published around three decades before scientists developed the ability to sequence DNA.Dr Hartley, who was at Cheltenham Science Festival this week presenting her own DNA-themed children\u0027s books, said: \u0027I think the children in the Famous Five could really have used DNA in solving their cases.\u0027But it doesn\u0027t tend to be in even modern children\u0027s books and it is hardly on the curriculum for primary school children.\u0027It is important to teach children early so that they get interested, but adults wrongly think it\u0027s a subject children won\u0027t understand.\u0027I just ask them how they would build a Lego model and they say they would need a set of instructions.\u0027DNA is the set of instructions for making the body.

The young talent featured includes photographer Rhea Storr, whose work looks at mixed-race identity growing up in Yorkshire Scots band Young Fathers fashion designers Martine Rose and Grace Wales Bonner and Jenn Nkiru, who worked on Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s Ape Shit video. It all begins with Zak’s father, Horace Ové, who was the first black British person to direct a feature film, 1975’s Pressure, about a black British teenager and the racism he experiences. Zak hopes this exhibition – which includes some work never seen by the public before – will provide a reassessment of his father’s legacy. “I’m really excited that the public will be able to see my father’s work again or perhaps discover it,” he says. “He was such a pioneer of his time.”The fact that Ové is not more widely known is symptomatic of the endemic lack of ersity in the arts, something that may now be changing. This exhibition follows Tate Modern’s Soul of a Nation last year, about art in the United States’s “black power” era, and Wales Bonner’s A Time for New Dreams showcase at the Serpentine Sackler gallery in January, which featured the work of black creatives including Liz Johnson Artur and Ben Okri. Forrester, who began making art in the mid-1970s, acknowledges that there has been a shift from his experience as a young artist. “When I was a student at Central Art School and the Royal College of Art, there were no black students in my year, and few black artists in the college as a whole,” he says. “There was also no evidence of black artists in commercial galleries. This is beginning to change.”Music has been a world where black British artists have had more freedom. Producer Bovell is contributing pieces he has collected over a 45-year career, working with the Slits, Janet Kay and poet Linton Kwesi Johnson. He says that working on the exhibition made him reassess his achievements. “It made me think about how important my work is and what a journey I have had,” he says, “and it made me think that everything I have done is good.” Bovell was born in Barbados in 1953 when it was still a British colony, but settled in London, making music from the late 60s. “The expression of black Britishness is seen in many walks of life,” he says. “I am one of the statistics that made something of the last 40 years.” Bovell is curious about the next generation in his lineage. “There are some exciting youngsters coming through,” he says. “I can only been proud to think that I’m maybe one of the giants upon whose shoulders they stand.”With so many contributors, there is space for myriad expressions of black Britishness. Ajamu provides a different point of view. The photographer is best known for his Fierce series, portraits of “young LGBT people from second-generation black British backgrounds, and those born and raised in the Caribbean and Africa”. He says: “Black British identity is multidimensional. It’s not just about the usual suspects: race, sexuality and gender. It’s place, class and much more besides. I was born and raised in Huddersfield that would be a very different experience from Halifax, Leeds or Dewsbury.”Ajamu has shown his Fierce images in London’s 800-year-old Guildhall. “It is an amazing space, with pre-Raphaelite paintings everywhere, very British,” he says. “This puts young black and brown people, not generally seen as part of that conversation, in the dialogue.” Arguably, this exhibition’s Somerset House venue, another rarified address, has a similar resonance. “This exhibition reflects unadulterated black pride,” says Ové, “with the freedom to fill in all the blanks, where we didn’t exist before.”Get Up, Stand Up Now is at Somerset House, WC2, Wednesday 12 June to 15 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c86fcb6c84d0518b88fe24cc5b0a8129d7286fc/56_226_2920_1752/master/2920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41b29cb73be8ccf39c57494ed343eb23","title":"uk galleries have embraced black artists says exhibition curator zak ove","story":"Zak Ové of Get Up, Stand Up Now show feels cultural scene has never been more acceptingBritain’s cultural institutions are more open than ever before to black British culture and the artists behind it, according to the curator of a landmark exhibition that charts 50 years of black creativity in the UK.Zak Ové, an artist and the curator of Get Up, Stand Up Now – which opens at Somerset House in London on Wednesday – believes black British artists are finally being properly represented in UK museums and galleries.“They’ve acknowledged a place for us,” said Ové, whose father, Horace Ové, is one of Britain’s most celebrated black film-makers and photographers. “That always existed in music, but now it’s open for the art world.“The horizons have broadened. Before, Africa was treated as something antiquated African art was something old that you looked at in the British Museum. Black British artists were ignored, mostly. But now more institutions are opening themselves up to the contemporary artists, and showing contemporary life for people in the global diaspora.”Ové pointed to the opening last month of Tate Britain’s Frank Bowling exhibition, which gives the Guyanese-born British artist his first retrospective in the UK at the age of 85, as a sign of overdue acknowledgement.Set across multiple rooms at Somerset House, Get Up, Stand Up Now explores the development of black artists, film-makers and musicians in the UK, from Windrush generation pioneers such as the photographers Vanley Burke, Armet Francis and Charlie Phillips to contemporary artists including Grace Wales Bonner, musicians such as Gaika, and the film director Jenn Nkiru.For Ové, the exhibition is also a chance to look back at the nascent black British art scene and acknowledge the artists who helped redefine the idea of being black and British. “These artists made work which really challenged what it meant to be British, and pushed the idea that this is a multicultural society and we needed to be validated within it,” he said.“Most of those artists weren’t queueing up for a badge or an exhibition or acknowledgement. That was work they felt had to be made by any means necessary and the thing that was pushing that work was looking at who we were and how we fit in. In Get Up, Stand Up Now, I’m interested in how that older work can inform the current generation about how to be brave and how to question our position again.”As well as focusing on the early practitioners of the 1950s and early 60s, the exhibition also shows how their work set the blueprint for a later generation including John Akomfrah, Steve McQueen and Sonia Boyce, who all have work in the exhibition. “I’m trying to talk about where it began and the voices who made it possible, and asking what was pertinent for them and what is still pertinent now,” said Ové.“This is about the foundations of black British culture, my parents’ generation were informing their peers that we are part of British society, like any other. They were enablers who delivered our culture into mainstream British culture, and now it’s permeated into all elements of British life.”He believes the current generation of black artists have a wider reach thanks to social media and the internet. “It’s very fertile right now, and there are lots of reasons for that,” he said. “We’re in the digital age, where you’ve got a generation that can share work online globally. A show like this, it can be seen today by someone and then beamed out all over the world.”At a time when populism is on the rise and the idea of a Britain ided along class, political and racial lines is growing, Ové hopes the exhibition can show the UK is a country that has meshed together many cultural elements and is ultimately better off for it. “Black British culture in this country is not separatist,” he said. “We exist in British culture and we’ve brought our culture and there’s been an exchange. That’s been constant and it’s one of the things that makes Britain great.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea42bdce2c95333b3e4421d48c825b7f58d0003/785_943_6295_3777/master/6295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1959e6edbf7a23037518341778ce038","title":"arcadia on the brink after intu rejects revised cva plan","story":"Philip Green’s group expected to go into administration if landlords refuse rent cutsThe future of Philip Green’s retail empire hangs in the balance after a major landlord confirmed it would not back a revised deal to be put to creditors on Wednesday.Arcadia, which has 570 shops, including Topshop, Topman, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Wallis and Outfit, was forced to postpone a vote on a rescue restructure last week.If the restructuring does not go ahead, Arcadia is expected to go into administration, putting 18,000 jobs at risk.The meeting was adjourned when it emerged that key landlords including Intu, M\u0026ampG, Aviva and Land Securities were minded to vote against the plan, which involves the closures of 23 shops and rent cuts on nearly 200. Aberdeen Standard and the Crown Estate are also thought to have been against the plan.If the restructuring is to go ahead, landlords accounting for at least half the rents owed by Arcadia must vote in favour of the plan, which involves seven insolvency processes known as company voluntary arrangements (CVAs). Sources at another major landlord said they did not think the revised offer was enough and that there was a strong chance the deal would fail. Property sources added that large landlords, including Intu, were also wary of new contracts with some retailers, such as Next, which have said they will not pay more than the lowest-paying tenant.Such deals could mean that any rent cuts agreed with Arcadia would be felt more widely across the retail sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/991350224aac2ca067fe9540558830e52ed3e09e/0_266_4846_2908/master/4846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c2c1462a95fc5666533bbcd3fc4ff26","title":"energy industry carbon emissions bp report fossil fuels","story":"BP report reveals that swings in global temperatures are increasing the use of fossil fuelsCarbon emissions from the global energy industry rose by the fastest rate in almost a decade in 2018 after surprise swings in global temperatures stoked extra demand for fossil fuels.BP’s annual global energy report revealed for the first time that fluctuating temperatures are increasing the world’s use of fossil fuels in spite of efforts to tackle the climate crisis.The recorded temperature swings – days which are much hotter or colder than normal – helped drive the world’s biggest jump in gas consumption for more than 30 years.They also stoked a second consecutive annual increase for coal use, reversing three years of decline earlier this decade.Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist, warned that the report reveals “a growing mismatch” between society’s rising demand for climate action and the actual pace of progress.“At a time when society is increasingly concerned about climate change and the need for action energy demand and emissions are growing at their fastest rate for years,” he said.Two-thirds of the world’s energy demand increase was due to higher demand in China, India and the US which was in part due to stronger industry as well as the “weather effect”.This was spurred by an “outsized” energy appetite in the US which recorded the highest number of days with hotter or colder than average days since the 1950s.“On hot days people turn to their air conditioning and fans, on cold days they turn to their heaters. That has a big impact,” Dale said.The unusually high number of “heating days” has continued in the first months of this year.The combined number of particularly hot and cold days was unusually high in the US, China and Russia where the use of fossil fuels remains high.The US shale heartlands helped to meet its rising energy demand with the biggest annual increase in oil and gas production for any country ever.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, said: “The longer carbon emissions continue to rise, the harder and more costly will be the necessary eventual adjustment to net-zero carbon emissions.”“As I have said before, this is not a race to renewables, but a race to reduce carbon emissions across many fronts,” he added.Last year’s growth in emissions represents the carbon equivalent of driving an extra 400m combustion engine cars onto the world’s roads, according to Dale. Meanwhile, electric vehicles rose by just 2m, to a total of 5m.Dale added that the growth in renewables would need to have climbed by more than twice the rate achieved over the past three years to offset the impact of burning coal for electricity.BP owns vast reserves of gas fields and consistently leads calls for countries to switch from coal to gas.It has also backed industry calls for governments to fund carbon capture technology which can scrub the emissions from the flues of power plants and factories before they reach the air.However, BP will not undertake “material” projects without government funding.“You can’t rely on the generosity of the private sector,” Dale said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa01e40cd388afe698532d01bcb01e12a803cfd/21_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8019211ada424a1545e92127544ddac","title":"behold the tory leadership candidates all in denial all in dreamland","story":"The final 10 seem oblivious of the scale of our national catastrophe, from schools to hospitals to homelessness.

He checks what happened to social security, and sees the gigantic size of benefit cuts.Look, he tells the patient in the next bed. For the first time in our lives, longevity is falling not rising: a year has been cropped off his life while he slept. Worse, infant mortality has risen for the past two years – something unknown in his lifetime. The number of children in care has doubled, as cutbacks in social workers mean there’s no one to help families before they reach crisis.When Van Winkle first woke, he had been eager to find out what brave new world of social progress had sprung up in his absence. Depressed, he turns on the bedside TV. On the news channel he finds an array of press conferences for prime ministerial candidates. He watches them strut their stuff in interviews, and follows their self-promoting newspaper articles. The word Brexit at first puzzles him, but then appals him as he pieces together the mighty political catastrophe that has befallen the country. Boris Johnson as frontrunner makes him yearn to fall back into a coma. He notes the rank hypocrisy of Gove snorting coke and the next day writing a bombastic anti-drug column in the Times. But even that seems less outrageous than Johnson’s sociopathic knack for cheating, lying and misleading voters, mysteriously forever invulnerable.Gove will abolish VAT, swapping it for a lesser sales tax. “I value every inidual. I want everyone to be the author of their own life story” – which sounds as if that means no one should expect help from the state for anything. Esther McVey would also purloin the £39bn owed to the EU, to spend on a public sector pay rise. Only Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart eschew the fairyland of competing tax cuts. As for Brexit, whether it’s “Ready to Lead” with Gove or “Ready for Raab”, this is all dreamland Brextasy.Van Winkle sinks into gloom at candidates’ familiar boasts that Britain will rule the waves again. These ministers, responsible for every aspect of British life, seem utterly oblivious of the mountain to climb just to get back to 2010, yet promise everything “world class” and “world beating”. “I want to make Britain walk tall in the world again,” proclaims Hunt. “I want to make us the fastest growing most dynamic, pro-business, pro-enterprise, hi-tech economy in Europe.” The Brexit reflex is just another twitch of the old imperial fantasy, Van Winkle notes. Why can’t our politicians express a dignified patriotic love of country without world-class bragging that only makes us look absurd in our current state?Gove does it too: “With Brexit, this can be the best country in the world.” He promises to “make Britain the best place to live, learn, raise a family, achieve your potential, and start and run a business”. Is that restoring benefits, raising school spending to our competitors’ level, repairing social care and health – while cutting taxes too? In fact-free mode, Gove boasts how many schools he improved.By now Van Winkle is weary of the backstories paraded: fish-dealer father, bus-driver father, time in care, rambling in Afghanistan, running a business. Who cares? Just start with tax and spend numbers that add up. Wasn’t this once the competent party? Which of them will admit the state into which they have plunged the country? All are clueless as to what it would take to repair.Pondering so many tax cuts, Van Winkle wonders what other public services could be sliced away? He is glad to see he is not alone: Paul Johnson, IFS guru, has blown the whole lot of them to kingdom come, totting up their billions of spending and billions of tax cuts, appalled they have “no fiscal strategy”, no “seriousness” – leaving treasury heads banging on their desks. Van Winkle’s head aches and he calls for pain relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c8ffa76af8a27831ab2870d18ca1c73bed994b9/272_90_1538_922/master/1538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b4945ae67768983f97938a3826f695","title":"kylie jenner handmaids tale party tasteless arwa mahdawi","story":"The Kardashian scion completely missed the point of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel, but the small-screen adaptation seems to revel in violence against womenPraise be, ladies. The world may be a dismal place at the moment, but Kylie Jenner is here to remind us that there is a bright side to everything – even torture, rape and oppression. The 21-year-old reality TV star and cosmetics mogul recently had the bright idea of throwing a Handmaid’s Tale-themed party for one of her BFFs. The book and TV show may be a downer, but, hey, the bright-red gowns look great on Instagram! Guests sipped “praise be vodka” and “under his eye tequila” cocktails while taking selfies – and completely missing the point of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel.Jenner’s bash, which she shared on social media (naturally), has prompted a backlash. It does seem remarkably tone-deaf to treat The Handmaid’s Tale like a hilarious joke when the US is becoming more like the fictional Gilead by the day. If you think that is an overdramatic comparison, just take a look at Alabama, which recently became the latest state to pass an extreme abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest. Not only does the bill force women to have their rapist’s babies, but Alabama law means the rapist can get parental rights and sue for custody. Meanwhile, any doctor caught performing an abortion could get 99 years in prison.While I think we can agree that Jenner’s party was in poor taste, getting outraged about it seems hypocritical. Is dressing up as a handmaid for fun really so much worse than watching the TV adaptation, which seems to revel in violence against women and has been described as “torture porn”? I am not sure it is. In any case, there is not much use in getting outraged, considering that all publicity is good publicity for the Kardashian-Jenner clan. The attention Jenner’s party garnered may even encourage her to stage a sequel. A glow-in-the-dark Chernobyl-themed party, perhaps? Got a feeling that might make the internet go nuclear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e693f85bca3afd3ed3a1431529568fa673b3dbc/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bba2bcadff8cc4c4c620fa657857637","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sunny","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sunny’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sunny’.Share your photos of what sunny means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 June at 10am.

This clarification could encourage a new demographic on to two wheels, and provide huge benefits to disabled and elderly people.The scheme is a complicated but well-used salary sacrifice scheme in which employees can get bikes, tax-free, via their employers. It starts with a year-long loan, which most people extend until the bike is worth so little they can “buy” it for a nominal sum or extend the hire for a percentage of the bike’s value. (After five or six years, HMRC considers a bike to have a negligible value).At present, employers and bike shops can administer the scheme, and it was widely believed that a £1,000 cap existed on the cost of the bike and equipment as part of the arrangement. The new minister for cycling, Michael Ellis, says that was always a misunderstanding as it applied only to bike shops and employers who are not registered with the Financial Conduct Authority – usually small independent ones.The larger bike shops, it turns out, could always have included more expensive bikes in the scheme, and the DfT says this weekend’s announcement was just to clarify that. Given Cycle to Work is now 20 years old, it’s about time.So why is this important?The “cap” would have excluded most electric cycles and non-standard cycles, such as those for people with disabilities, which tend to cost more than £1,000. Electrically assisted bikes work by giving you a boost as you pedal, via a battery-powered motor. They are limited to 250w, and a top speed of 15.5mph. Most people see the main benefit of this clarification as being for the uptake of those bikes.The UK is behind this trend – just 70,000 ebikes were sold in the country last year.People like ebikes because they make longer commutes easier, you can pedal further in normal clothes without getting sweaty, they give you a boost up hills (it’s like someone pushing the bike when you’re pedalling). They’re also great if you’re a little out of shape and want to get active – or if you have knee problems, or are just getting older. A survey by the disabled cycling charity Wheels for Wellbeing found one in five disabled cyclists uses some form of electrical assistance when they cycle.Last autumn, while cycling home one rainy night, I got chatting with a man who had weighed 32 stone (203kg) , and after bariatric surgery switched from moped to ebike on his 11-mile commute – each way – to help keep the weight off. He is lucky to live near an excellent protected cycle route, which we rode along as we chatted. He loves the new wheels, which only take him five minutes longer than the moped, and help him maintain his fitness.According to research based on commuting patterns, widespread ebike use in the UK has the potential to shift more than one in four work trips to cycles – if we also build safe cycle routes. That could clearly have a massive impact on air pollution, congestion and people’s health.Staff in specialist ebike shops I’ve spoken to say many customers aren’t switching from normal bikes but from cars, and public transport. They are fed up with traffic jams, and getting wise to the fact ebikes are cheaper, healthier, often quicker – and more fun. People talk about the “ebike smile”, and shops are selling them with this in mind – focusing less on groupsets and weight and more on what you’ll use it for. Full mudguards, a rack and a basket? No problem.Ebikes save people money, too. An Evans survey of 2,000 commuters estimated that by switching from car, bus, tube or train to ebikes, commuters could save an average of £7,791 over five years.I ride a normal bike, but last year I was lent an ebike. I rode it to the theatre one balmy night, a 20 mile round trip, in heels and a skirt. I would normally have taken public transport. It was a revelation. No sweat, no stress, and I barely noticed the fierce headwind. If more people had good quality bike routes, it’s easy to see the transformative impact the combination could have on those who don’t ride already.Cycle to Work is great for employees but self-employed people, those who are out of work or retired people will not be able to take advantage of it. As disabled people are more likely to be out of work or self-employed, a government expansion of the scheme to include these groups could be transformative.But the most important impact this clarification may have is to help more people realise cycling is something they can do too – ebikes open up cycling to everyone, showing it’s not just for the fit and the brave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d52e596aaccc0cc723f2fc7ea81a145902a5e01/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fddfe0a96459f254b420cca9f145200","title":"the skys the limit a cold wall confirms its ascent with new collection lfwm","story":"Samuel Ross’s brand stood out at LFWM on Monday - thanks to the designer extending the invite to young people, along with celebritiesFashion label A-Cold-Wall - set up five years ago - was the highlight of the last day of the London fashion week men’s shows in London. While not yet a household name, consider that a matter of time. Hours after designer Samuel Ross unveiled his springsummer 2020 collection, he scooped the British Fashion Council and GQ menswear prize, showing the faith that the British fashion industry have in him to take operations global.This is a brand that has grown impressively on social media – with nearly 600k dedicated followers on Instagram. Ross paid this audience back on a rainy Monday afternoon: for his fourth show, around 100 young people dressed in hoodies, bucket hats and trainers joined the fashion crowd and celebrities including Arsenal player Héctor Bellerín, film director Steve McQueen and rapper A$AP Ferg.Watching the show from a balcony at an industrial printworks in south-east London, many members of the public filmed the event on smart phones in order to post video to their social media accounts. Arguably, in the modern era, this peer-to-peer coverage is priceless. It has helped A-Cold-Wall go from five stockists in 2014 to 165 in 2019, and gain a place in the hypebeast scene alongside Supreme, Palace and Off-White, the label founded by Ross’s mentor Virgil Abloh.Ross is also gaining fans within the industry now – winning Emerging Menswear Talent at the British Fashion Awards last year. Last month, he joined the Copenhagen fashion summit to discuss sustainability with Nike’s chief design officer, John Hoke.The collection continued the themes that Ross has established. He takes silhouettes associated with streetwear – hooded jackets, parkas, combat trousers – and reduces them down to minimal elements, with an architectural feel. A hooded top had armour-like oversleeves, while a jacket with multiple pockets looked like a fashion take on survivalist gear. Some pieces showed a move towards tailoring, with some suits and a trench shape throughout. Canvas boots, a collaboration with Converse, will no doubt sell out before they even hit those 165 stores.While the designs are pretty wearable, Ross adds a sense of drama through pounding music and styling. Most models had clay coating part of their skin, and some had lead stuck to their faces. According to the show notes, this element was about “exploring our storied relationship between material and emotion”.After the show, Ross – a serene presence dressed in a white shirt and matching trousers, with bare feet, despite the concrete floor – continued with the high-brow pronouncements. “I wanted to imbue the heaviness of lead into garment form,” he said. “My father is a stained-glass artist, one of the only black stained-glass artists in the country. I grew up with him moulding and working with lead.” He then asked: “How do we expand on the relationship to object and how object permeates and influences how we operate in social space?”His thoughts on bringing A-Cold-Wall fans into the show were less academic. As a black, working-class designer, Ross is still unusual in fashion. He wants to open doors to others.“The main reason I wanted to invite the public in was so there wasn’t this conservative ision which is often in fashion,” he says. “It doesn’t feel very liberal to me.” Ross first studied graphic design and product design before setting up his brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7eec05b78efaa7bda9ceeb73f596cc0b71ba98b/0_0_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b93f7a15205ffb779578865fb1c98d4","title":"how we made dazed and confused richard linklater wiley wiggins","story":"‘When the studio head realised I was directing, he thought, “Oh no, it’s going to be one of those arty, jerk-offski movies.” I still have PTSD thinking about it’I thought the 1970s sucked. Dazed was supposed to be an anti-nostalgic movie. But it’s like trying to make an anti-war movie – just by depicting it, you make it look fun. I wanted to do a realistic teen movie – most of them had too much drama and plot but teenage life is more like you’re looking for the party, looking for something cool, the endless pursuit of something you never find, and even if you do, you never quite appreciate it.An experimental version of the film had been floating around in my head between 1989 and 91 – just four guys driving around in a car busting mailboxes to ZZ Top. I really did that one night in this little town in south Houston with a friend by the end of the evening we had driven 138 miles and never left the city limits. But I quickly realised I wanted to represent different points of view. I wrote a long first draft in about a month. We leapfrogged about 30 other projects that were in development at Universal.There were very few teenage movies at the time, so every young actor was clamouring to be in it. We cast in New York – where I met Parker Posey – Los Angeles and Austin. Wiley Wiggins was the big find there. He was a 15-year-old with all the bad habits of a grad student: smoking cigarettes, hanging out at coffee shops, my kind of guy.I made the actors mixtapes of music their characters would listen to. The girls got a lot of Joni Mitchell Mitch, Wiley’s character, was at the cooler end of the 70s, glam and prog rock – he would be the first guy to buy the Ramones. I wanted it to look like it was shot in the 70s, so I didn’t use Steadicam. Stylistically, it was trying its best to look like one of those drive-in movies.Improvisation was one of the things that made the studio nervous, but it added a lot of additional humour to Dazed and Confused. Not everyone picks up on the vibe of what you’re trying to do, though. There was one actor, Shawn Andrews, who wasn’t exactly rocking and rolling with the rest of the cast. So I switched things around to expand Matthew McConaughey’s role instead.After shooting was over, I went to Los Angeles for the finishing touches. The studio put me up in soulless corporate accommodation. I didn’t think I was going to be there for long, but I realised they were doing this psy-ops thing on me, trying to wear me down. People seemed to really enjoy the screenings, but then their ratings on certain aspects were always lower than executives thought they should be, which confirmed their fears that I had made an art film. They wanted me to put in modern music – or reshoot. But I didn’t take any of their dumb ideas.The film made $8m on a $6.9m budget. I never made a penny off anything to do with it – I waived most of my rights to pay for the soundtrack. I don’t think it’s my best movie, but it represents a rite of passage for the “busters”, the end of the baby-boom generation. I also enjoy people who weren’t even born then liking the film. It tells you there’s something about teenagedom that never changes.I was sitting outside Captain Quackenbush’s Intergalactic Espresso House on the Drag in Austin when Anne Walker, the co-producer, gave me a casting-call leaflet. I was excited because it said it was the same production team as Slacker, which I had seen five times. Rick was a nice, personable guy who didn’t seem like a real adult. The night before we started shooting, everyone went to the Hole in the Wall bar to play pool. I tried to play it cool with Nicky Katt and the guys who were going to beat me with paddles as part of the film’s freshmen initiation scenes, but the first thing I did was shoot the cue ball off the table. It was a very close-knit cast and a lot of great relationships were formed. Most people were staying in the Radisson hotel, but I was a local kid who still lived at home. So I only heard about their off-hours shenanigans – going to gun ranges, taking mushrooms and rafting down the river.I dropped out of school shortly after the film was shot, so I didn’t experience the full blast of recognition. But it was a slow burn: it played for five years at the same theatre Slacker had played at. People would come up to me with preconceived notions – that I was big-headed, or wanted to smoke weed with random strangers in broad daylight. At the same time, it has opened so many doors for me that I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. It was important for me, especially at that time in my life when I was a little bit of a fuckup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd4585336371b332b9e35f382a369a76015f4be0/0_745_4933_2959/master/4933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1564bc4f03a9e0aae1eac4a549fec28a","title":"true grit john wayne 1969 henry hathaway","story":"Released in the same year as The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Henry Hathaway’s western was defiantly old-fashioned in comparisonThe year 1969 was a true inflection point for the American western, a once-dominant genre that had become a casualty of the culture, particularly when Vietnam had rendered the moral clarity of white hats and black hats obsolete. A handful of westerns were released by major studios that year, including forgettable or regrettable star vehicles for Burt Reynolds (Sam Whiskey) and Clint Eastwood (Paint Your Wagon), who were trying to revitalize the genre with a touch of whimsy. But 50 years later, three very different films have endured: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Wild Bunch and True Grit. Together, they represented the past, present and future of the western.In the present, there was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the year’s runaway box-office smash, grossing more than the counterculture duo of Midnight Cowboy and Easy Rider, the second- and third-place finishers, combined. George Roy Hill’s hip western-comedy, scripted by William Goldman and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, turned a story of outlaw bank robbers into a knowing and cheerfully sardonic entertainment that felt attuned to modern sensibilities. Sam Peckinpah’s Wild Bunch predicted a future of revisionist westerns, full of grizzled antiheroes, great spasms of stylized violence, and the messy inevitability of unhappy endings. A whiff of death from a genre in decline.By contrast, True Grit looks like it could have been released 10, 20 or 30 years earlier, and with many of the same people working behind and in front of the camera. Its legendary producer, Hal B Wallis, was the driving force behind such Golden Age classics as Casablanca and The Adventures of Robin Hood, and his director, Henry Hathaway, cut his teeth as Cecil B DeMille’s assistant on 1923’s Ben Hur before spending decades making studio westerns, including a 1932 debut (Heritage of the Desert) that gave Randolph Scott his start and seven films with Gary Cooper. And then, of course, there’s John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn, stretching himself enough to win his only Oscar for best actor, but drawing heavily on his own pre-established iconography. It was, for him, a well-earned victory lap.True Grit may be defiantly old-fashioned and stodgy when considered against the films of the day, but it’s also an example of how durable the genre actually was – and how it would be again in 2010, when the Coen brothers took their own crack at Charles Portis’s 1968 novel and produced the biggest hit of their careers. What would be more escapist than ducking into a movie theater in the summer of ’69 and stepping into a time machine where John Wayne is a big star, answering a call to adventure across a beautiful Technicolor expanse of mountains and prairies? The film has much more sophistication than the average throwback, but the search for justice across Indian Territory is uncomplicated and righteous, and the half-contentioushalf-sentimental relationship between a plucky teenager and an irascible old coot grounds it in the tried-and-true. The defiant message here is: this can still work!And boy does it ever. Kim Darby didn’t get much of a career boost for playing Mattie Ross, a fiercely determined and morally upstanding tomboy on the hunt for her father’s killer, but every bit of energy and urgency the film needs comes from her. When Mattie’s father is shot by Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), a hired hand on their ranch near Fort Smith, Arkansas, she takes it upon herself to make sure he’s caught and dragged before the hanging judge. Whatever emotion she feels about the loss is set aside, limited to a brief crying jag in the privacy of a hotel bedroom, and she’s all business the rest of the time. When the Fort Smith sheriff doesn’t seem sufficiently motivated, she seeks out US marshal Cogburn (Wayne), a one-eyed whiskey guzzler who lives alone with a Chinese shopkeep and a cat he calls General Sterling Price.The odd man out in their posse is a Texas ranger named La Boeuf (Glen Campbell), which Wayne and everyone else pronounce as “La Beef”, as part of his instinctual disrespect for Texans – and, really, anyone who fought for the Confederacy during the civil war. (La Boeuf makes a point of saying he fought for General Kirby Smith, rather than the south, which suggests a sense of shame that stands out in our current age of tiki-torch monument protests.) The chemistry between the three is terrific, despite Campbell’s limitations as an actor, because it’s constantly changing: Rooster and La Boeuf are sometimes aligned as mercenaries who see Chaney as a chance to take money from Mattie and from the family of a Texas state senator that the scoundrel also shot. Rooster comes to Mattie’s defense when Le Boeuf treats her like a wayward child and whips her with a switch, but the tables turn on that, too, when Rooster’s protective side holds her back.Wayne called Marguerite Roberts’ script the best he’d ever read – she was on the Hollywood blacklist, which made them odd political bedfellows – and True Grit has nearly as much pop in the dialogue as the showier Butch Cassidy. Mattie gets to turn her father’s oversized pistol on Chaney, but language is her weapon of choice, delivered in such an intellectual fusillade that her adversaries tend to surrender quickly. (A running joke about the lawyer she intends to sic on them has a wonderful payoff.) The three leads exchange playful barbs and colorful stories, too, with Rooster ragging on La Boeuf’s marksmanship (“This is the famous horse killer from El Paso”) or spending the downtime before an ambush sharing the troubled events from his life that have gotten him to this place.There’s a degree to which True Grit is a victory lap for Wayne, who gets one of his last – and certainly one of his best – opportunities to pay off a career in westerns. Yet Wayne genuinely lets down his guard in key moments and allows real pain and vulnerability to seep through, enough to complicate his tough-guy persona without demolishing it altogether. It may not have the gravitas of Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven, but it’s the same type of performance, the reckoning of a western gunslinger who’s seen and done terrible things, lost the people he loved, and seems intent on living out his remaining days alone. Without the redemptive power of Mattie’s kindness and decency, True Grit is about a man left to drink himself to death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33c95fa99b439ed1ac5ef2f7a75a71d5d71b8819/0_80_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332c315c6f55d9e8682a36e06501ca6b","title":"daniel james manchester united swansea huge prospect","story":"Graham Potter is not the sort to get carried away but as the questions about Daniel James kept coming, and the realisation that everyone had witnessed something special started to sink in, even Swansea’s manager was sounding like an excited supporter. “There were a few instances, not just the goal,” said Potter, smiling, almost laughing, “and it’s just off-your-seat stuff, like ‘wow’.”It was February, FA Cup fifth-round day, and the best way to describe James that afternoon is unplayable. Three Brentford players were booked for bringing him down and Ezri Konsa received a red card for a professional foul on the Wales international, who was involved in three of Swansea’s four goals. Including that goal: 84yds covered in 8.48sec, with a ball at his feet, and three Brentford players trying, and desperately failing, to keep up.Although the Liberty Stadium was half empty on that Sunday afternoon, a much wider audience was taking note. The goal – six touches from the edge of his own penalty area to the back of the Brentford net – made him an internet hit. As for the football industry, Potter accepted there and then that, if James left in the summer, it would be for the Premier League.Incredibly James had been minutes away from joining another Championship club on loan less than three weeks earlier, in a deadline-day deal with Leeds that was described as ludicrous by some of those involved and would have led to Swansea picking up next to nothing until June. Swansea belatedly saw sense – Huw Jenkins, who would resign as chairman a few days later, was not alone in realising the plug needed to be pulled – and James returned to south Wales.At the time James was devastated. His family live in South Cave, in east Yorkshire, and playing for Leeds, who were chasing promotion under Marcelo Bielsa, was an attractive proposition. Little more than four months on James may well reflect that the collapse of that move was a blessing in disguise. There is, after all, no guarantee he would have gone on to turn in the sort of displays for Leeds that prompted Manchester United to part with £15m and make him their first signing of the summer.It was during the second half of the season at Swansea that James, with the Leeds fiasco pushed to the back of his mind and confidence flowing, really started to take his game to another level. The potential has always been there – James was a hugely promising Wales youth international when Swansea signed him from Hull as an academy player for £72,000 in 2014 – but getting an opportunity at first-team level took time and there were setbacks along the way.Less than two years ago James returned from a loan spell at Shrewsbury without kicking a ball. He had undergone a minor operation shortly before and, with that in mind, the move was probably not well-timed. Others close to James question whether he was suited to Paul Hurst’s style of football. Either way, it is hard not to smile at the headline on a Shropshire Star article in August 2017, shortly before James’s loan move came to a premature end: “Paul Hurst calls on Shrewsbury loanee Dan James to get up to speed”.That was not a problem last season in more ways than one. James, who had been mulling over joining Yeovil on loan in August, was told by Potter that he would get a chance at Swansea, and by October the youngster was starting to make a big impression, not least because of that breathtaking pace. He is not just lightning quick when he has space to run into but explosive from a standing start over short distances. Defenders never know whether to get tight or drop off.If that FA Cup tie against Brentford put James on the map, Stoke’s visit in April may well have taken him in the direction of Old Trafford. He scored another wonder goal that night – Ryan Giggs, the Wales manager, was applauding in the stand – and Stoke finished with nine men after two players were sent off for fouling James. Once again he was unplayable. “It was one of the best inidual performances I have ever seen as a fellow player,” Joe Allen, the Stoke and Wales midfielder, said this week.While James’s speed is something to behold, there is work to do to refine other areas of his game and United supporters may need to be patient in that respect. His finishing can be erratic – he scored six times last season for Swansea but could easily have ended up in double figures with a touch more conviction in front of goal – and the final ball was not always in keeping with what went before it. That said, there were clear signs of improvement towards the end of the season, particularly with his crossing, and it is also worth remembering that we are talking about a player who is only 21 and has made 42 appearances in senior football for club and country.In that sense it feels as though James has come a long way in a short time, yet the journey that takes place away from the limelight is overlooked by many, though not by everyone. When Swansea Under-23s travelled to Hull in February, shortly after that barnstorming performance against Brentford, Kevan and Elaine James turned up to thank the Welsh club’s coaching staff personally for the part they played in their son’s development – a nice touch.Sadly, desperately sadly, Kevan died suddenly last month, not long after the wheels for the transfer to Manchester United were set in motion. DJ, as he is known to his friends and teammates, posted a heartfelt message on his Instagram account a few days ago, describing his dad as his inspiration and promising to make him proud. Kevan was already that and more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee63484663fb5ed8d0751b66376a06dafb571ece/0_104_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a52019cd747fc0ff985b1bbf28c2bdc","title":"sustainable efl club stevenage chairman luck selling fans football","story":"Running a sustainable Football League club is possible only if you are lucky, according to the Stevenage chairman, who is about to offer shares in his club to supporters.Phil Wallace has presided over the most successful period in Stevenage FC’s history since he bought the team in 1999. But with clubs in the Football League experiencing growing financial uncertainty – 52 of the 72 clubs reported losses in 2017-18 – Wallace says it is no longer enough simply to run your club well if you want to keep your head above water in the lower leagues.“In my opinion you can’t run a football league club sustainably without luck,” says Wallace, whose primary commercial interest is the £1.7bn valued Lamex Food Group. “You’ve got to have good housekeeping, good governance. You need to be smart with your recruitment. You need to be clever and talented with your coaching. But then you also need luck. It’s not a business in the way that my company is.”Stevenage finished just a point outside the League Two play-offs last season and posted a small profit in 2017-18. But the results were in large part due to the sale of the young defender Ben Wilmot to Premier League Watford and Wallace believes unexpected windfalls are increasingly important in keeping smaller clubs afloat.Wallace acknowledges that some clubs are less dependent on good fortune – those with rich owners. Indeed among the clubs posting the biggest losses were Wolves and Fulham, who both invested heavily, but successfully, in their attempts to reach the Premier League.“We would take that money and principally invest in the recruitment of young players and wages, so that we can attract better players,” Wallace says. “The idea would be that, if you are going to attract better players, we are improving our chances of getting promoted from League Two to League One."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4cd0405f0ec2727265880d2937b1df90c03e649/0_21_1833_1100/master/1833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c781c53c96425400263052a855536e","title":"new zealand v netherlands womens world cup 2019 live","story":"77 min: Satchell bustles through on the right, but her touch is poor, forcing her wide, and she dribbles a shot into the side netting.74 min: New Zealand make two more changes, Wilkinson on for White, Satchell on for the profligate Gregorius.72 min: Erceg adjusts just in time to flick a cross away from the lurking Miedema. It’s been all Holland in the last 20 minutes. They’re banging on the door.68 min: Van Lunteren crashes one over from 25 yards.66 min: Van Lunteren dashes to the byline and pulls the ball back to Miedema, who crashes a shot goalwards and can’t believe it when Nayler makes an instinctive stop with her legs!64 min: Van der Gragt appears to have recovered.61 min: Van der Gragt is hobbling. She needs some treatment from the physio.60 min: Martens sends Miedema through on goal, but the striker’s shot drifts inches wide of the far post.59 min: Van Lunteren sends a dangerous cross in from the right but Stott heads away.56 min: Miedema threatens again, almost reaching a loose ball in the New Zealand area, but Nayler manages to shovel it away.55 min: There’s a VAR check for a possible penalty. Apparently there was a handball. They’re not telling us who handballed it. Anyway the drama passes quickly. No penalty. To either side.54 min: Miedema locates Martens on the left. She shifts the ball on to her left foot, makes space for a shot and whips it over the bar.53 min: Up the other end Miedema surges through on goal, but Nayler speeds off her line to smother the danger. Good goalkeeping.52 min: Chance drives down the left and pings a low cross into the middle. Gregorius is this far away from turning it in. Hassett picks up possession on the right. Her cross finds Gregorius, but the striker’s looping effort doesn’t have enough pace on it to beat Van Veenendaal.48 min: Nayler has to rush to boot a backpass away. Martens was closing in.46 min: Holland get the second half underway.All told, this is a very entertaining game of football. Definite shades of the New Zealanders’ win over England, where they defended resolutely and nabbed a goal. The Kiwis are certainly doing better than their Antipodean cousins - Australia got tonked 3-0 by the Netherlands in their final pre-tournament friendly.There have been chances at both ends, but it’s goalless at the break. See you in 15 minutes.45 min+1: Bloodworth misses a great chance! A New Zealand corner is only half cleared and Van de Donk feeds Miedema on the edge of the area. Miedema drives down the left and lifts a cross into the middle. Nayler comes and flaps at it, with Martens closing in, and takes a whack for her troubles. The ball breaks to Bloodworth, but she scuffs a comical shot wide with the goal gaping.45 min: Miedema’s shot from 20 yards is deflected wide for a corner.44 min: “The Oranje and the Kiwis?” Peter Oh says. “Can we call it the Vitamin C derby?” 42 min: It’s been a decent half, but both teams need a sharper edge in the final third. Holland haven’t created enough for all the possession they’ve enjoyed.39 min: Spitse’s dangerous inswinging corner from the left somehow evades everyone in the middle and bounces wide of the far post. It was one of those that only needed a touch.38 min: Holland win a corner on the left.34 min: New Zealand make a rare sortie and go close to snatching the lead, only for Van Veenendaal to push White’s swerving 25-yarder away for a corner.30 min: Martens slips a pass through to Miedema, but the striker’s shot is blocked by Bott.29 min: The corner comes in from the right. A New Zealand defender takes a tumble, sparking mayhem in the area. Bloodworth rises highest to head the ball into the middle. It flicks off a New Zealand head, leaving Nayler stranded and the goal vacant. Yet Martens can’t rise high enough at the far post and heads over the bar!28 min: Holland win a corner on the right.26 min: The stretcher has been sent away. After a chat with the physio it seems Gregorius will continue. Panic over.25 min: Gregorius is down injured. They’re calling for a stretcher.24 min: Holland are very dominant in possession now. But there’s always a sense New Zealand could capitalise on an error or catch them on the break.22 min: At the risk of jinxing them, these Kiwis can defend. They’re also putting in a strong defensive effort so far despite missing the services of Meikayla Moore, whose World Cup was over before it began when she ruptured her Achilles tendon in training the other day.19 min: The corner comes to nothing.18 min: Martens inconveniences Bott again, twisting and turning, but she has to settle for a corner after running out of room. 17 min: Holland are beginning to dominate. Their football is slick and quick. A goal could be on the way.13 min: Holland stir at the other end, attacking down the right again, but Miedema heads over from 12 yards. This has been a bright start.11 min: New Zealand hit the bar! Holland make a right John Stones of an attempt to play out from the back and get themselves into a horrible mess. Chance nabs possession, drives to the left and pings a lovely shot towards the far corner. It beats Van Veenendaal and looks like it’s heading in – only for the ball to crash back off the face of the bar. What a let-off for the Dutch. Though they still have some defending to do. New Zealand swing a cross into the area and Gregorius heads straight at Van Veenendaal.10 min: Van de Sanden sends a cross in from the right. It bounces to Martens, who sweeps a low shot towards the bottom corner from 15 yards, but Nayler gets down to make a good save. That was a sign of the threat from Martens.9 min: Riley sends a ball over the top, looking for Gregorius, and momentarily Holland look in trouble. Until the flag goes up for offside.7 min: Van de Donk appears to have recovered from that blow.5 min: This is worrying for Holland. Van de Donk is down with an injury. Her afternoon might be over.3 min: New Zealand respond in kind, Percival charging down the right, but her cross is cleared.Peep! New Zealand, all in white, get the game underway. They’re kicking from right to left. You know what Holland are wearing. And the Dutch are on the attack straight away, Martens turning away from Bott quite brilliantly on the left. The forward sends in a cross, but it’s headed away.We’ve had the anthems. Now a jaunty dance beat is blaring round the stadium. As sure a sign as any the game’s about to begin.Here come the teams. Football soon!It is a heavily Dutch crowd here in Le Havre - with swathes of orange in the crowd and only the odd patch of white (the New Zealand football teams wear white, in contrast to their rugby colleagues). The Netherlands are definitely favourites today, so it could be a fun day in the sun for the visiting Dutch fans.“Looking forward to seeing the Dutch attackers today,” Rob Edwards says. “Miedema and Martens is probably the best strike force in the competition.”It’s an exciting combination. So exciting, in fact, that I went to interview Miedema at Arsenal a couple of years ago. Enjoy!Hello. Time for the European champions to get their tournament underway. This is only the second time the Netherlands have qualified for a World Cup, following on from their appearance at the 2015 edition, but they have plenty of big names and are expected to go far in France. They’re in a tough group, however, and will need to be on their game to deal with New Zealand, who are back on firmer ground after wobbling in 2018. There’s a genuine feeling that New Zealand could win the whole thing, though that belief will be severely tested here. Indeed a few burning questions should get answered over the next few hours. It should be fascinating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5436f62ef0d8fcef8742fac5d53941039d90a67a/0_103_2896_1737/master/2896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f84ecb5b665ba75ebde8d127a16fefb","title":"totally unjustifiable older readers on losing free tv licence","story":"After BBC announced that most over-75s will have to pay, we hear from some of those affectedI am a 98-year-old widow and live on my own. Both my children work, so I am on my own all day. I have very poor balance thus cannot walk, and I no longer drive, so the TV is company for me. My hearing is poor so I cannot rely upon the radio. The combination of pictures and sound keep me in touch with what is going on in the world. When I began drawing my pension 33 years ago, I thought I had plenty. Over time my pension has not kept pace with inflation, so I have to be particularly frugal. I would probably have to say no to purchasing a TV licence. Evelyn, 98, WokingHaving reached the age of 75 last year it now looks like the benefit I derive from the free licence will be short-lived. Given the choices available to the BBC I think they have gone for a pragmatic least worst option. The real culprit here is the Tory government after its decision to load the BBC with the cost of the benefit created by Gordon Brown as one element in a government budget package intended to help those less able to provide for themselves.  is right to highlight the fact that while the government-initiated removal of the free TV licence is now going ahead, Boris Johnson is promising an increase in the higher-rate tax threshold to £80,000. You couldn’t make it up. Robert, 76, BuckinghamshireMy wife is old enough for us not to pay the licence fee but in June 2020 we will have to start paying. I believe this is the right decision for us as we can well afford to pay the fee as we both have index-linked pensions. It makes sense that only pensioners on pension credit should receive the benefit but I feel sorry for those pensioners whose income only just exceeds the pension credit limit and those who are entitled to pension credit but do not claim it. Every effort should be made to encourage those who are entitled to claim pension credit. Tom Misselbrook, 70, HerefordshireOf 37 countries surveyed in a 2017 OECD review it was reported that Britain was at the very bottom of the state pension league table. Pensioners, many of whom live in isolation, rely on television as their only contact with the outside world. Free TV licences for the over-75s must be retained as one part of a caring and compassionate social system. George Osborne’s decision to make the BBC responsible for what should clearly be a responsibility of government was, and remains, totally unjustifiable. The government must be made to accept that it cannot subcontract its social policies. Haydn Richard Watkins, 82, HampshireI am single, living on a fixed personal pension. This charge if introduced suddenly will only just be covered by the increase in my statutory state pension. Whilst accepting that the money has to come from somewhere, I do feel that the government has welshed on the original deal and at best should phase it in over a five-year period. James Underwood, 81, WiltshireI’m disgusted, to say the least, as the BBC programming is so much repeats that I rarely watch the BBC channels but I will still have to pay for licence. I like watching sport but the BBC is getting less coverage of sporting occasions, especially rugby. I am an 81-year-old widow, living alone. I live in a development of flats with neighbours of a similar age, and many residents are unable to go out, so TV is a lifeline.

In late 2017 the government confirmed it was putting a stop to the sale of new leasehold houses in England, and a consultation on other measures ended in November 2018.The CMA said its investigation would look at two key areas. One was potential mis-selling, focusing on whether people who had bought a leasehold property were given the information they needed to fully understand what they were taking on – for example, on their rights around buying their freehold.The other area of concern was potentially unfair contract terms, and whether these were resulting in people being charged excessive fees. During the last few years cases have emerged where buyers have discovered that their ground rent doubled every 10 or 15 years. In 2016 the  revealed the case of a Birmingham flat owner who discovered that her ground rent was not £250 a year, as she had thought, but £8,000 a year, and would keep doubling so that in 95 years it would be £8m.George Lusty, senior director for consumer enforcement at the CMA, said: “Buying a home is one of the most expensive and important purchases a person can make. So, it’s essential they fully understand the contract they are signing – including whether they will have to pay more than they bargained for.“Our investigation will shed light on potential misleading practices and unfair terms to help better protect people buying a home in future.”The CMA said its investigation followed ongoing concerns about the fairness, clarity and presentation of some leasehold contract terms, “which could lead to people being stung by costly fees over a long period, or having to abide by onerous terms”.In May this year the  outlined the case of a London leaseholder living in a council tower block who had received a bill for £146,000, representing his share of the cost of refurbishing the block.The competition watchdog will be writing to companies across the sector, including developers, lenders and freeholders, to request information on their contracts.If the CMA thinks a company’s practices are misleading, or that a firm’s contracts contain unfair clauses, it could take enforcement action to require the company to change how it operates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80d8397cac577ba260112efc91b09af977c7df01/0_244_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11128e655799484f7d58561ef8060d28","title":"daniil trifonov review barbican london","story":"Barbican, LondonA programme of Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev revealed new aspects of the young Russian’s artistryThe centrepiece of Daniil Trifonov’s residency with the London Symphony Orchestra this month was a solo recital. It was a well-packed, generous performance, which provided further confirmation that the 28-year-old Russian is one of the finest pianists today. Despite his celebrity, though, Trifonov is still revealing new aspects of his artistry. His reputation was founded on his sometimes astounding performances of Chopin, Liszt and Rachmaninov, but here, though his encore was Rachmaninov (an arrangement – perhaps his own? – of Vocalise) his programme was based upon substantial works by Beethoven, Schumann and Prokofiev.All received revelatory performances, whether in the hyperactive, almost anarchic figuration conjured up in his left hand through the scherzo of Beethoven’s E flat Sonata Op 31 No 3, or the glittering decoration in the Andante Favori, originally intended as the central movement of the Waldstein Sonata, with which Trifonov had preceded that sonata. Likewise the barbaric intensity he conferred on the whirling treacherous chords of Schumann’s Presto Passionato, the original finale for his G minor Sonata Op 22.The main Schumann work was the Bunte Blätter Op 99, a collection of 14 disparate miniatures dating from the late 1830s and early 1840s, which the composer published as an album in 1852. They are rarely played as a single set, but Trifonov gave them an extraordinary sense of coherence, sometimes echoing the better known cycles such as Carnaval and Kreisleriana, while elsewhere suggesting that Chopin, his studies and preludes especially, had left a mark.Prokofiev’s Eighth Sonata, the last of his wartime trilogy of sonatas, had the second half of the recital to itself. It’s a work that keeps its fury under wraps until the last movement, and though Trifonov’s performance of the central Andante wasn’t exactly “dreamy” as its marking directs, he followed suit, even reining back during the faster, central episode of the first movement. But when the violence did erupt in the grinding dissonances of the finale, it was overwhelming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a0df59608e1fd9743e5c6f169f727dc2c0f5aca/59_82_1537_922/master/1537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b45001d251faf23831c248a7f094fc0","title":"i can go for that five essential yacht rock classics","story":"Katie Puckrick’s new TV doc reappraises the smooth, sad and seedy side of the maligned genre. Here she reveals the best tracksWith its urgent pace and aim to “make it to the border of Mexico”, Cross sums up the exhilaration of escape so essential to yacht. The power of the genre lies in the longing, so it’s most effective when heard in a landlocked location a million miles away from the nearest marina. Since aspiration crosses class, it doesn’t matter whether one’s home turf is the country club or a trailer park: listening to this song has the same effect – it nurses that ache for freedom.A YR hallmark is “upbeat-downbeat”: an approach that folds life’s bittersweet complexities within happy-snappy musical flourishes. A great example of upbeat-downbeat is this Doobie Brothers classic, showcasing the misplaced optimism of a wounded romantic. Singer Michael McDonald is in full fuzzy-throated throttle. Those are his BVs on Ride Like the Wind, and on any number of Steely Dan tracks, including …The frisson of yacht rock derives from its blend of bourgie feelgood bounce crossed with a shiver of thwarted desire.

Thanks to LA’s session musician elite, Hey Nineteen is polished to a sheen, but the narrator’s regretful realisation that he is too old to mack on teenage girls makes for uneasy listening.Generally, female musicians didn’t focus their talents on the yacht genre: its palette was too limiting for the era’s sophisticated female artists beyond a song or two. In 1975, Mitchell made what’s considered “accidental yacht rock”. This chilly saga of tarnished love concerns a woman trapped in a big house and a loveless marriage. Mitchell made the misery of rich people seem glamorous, creating “dark yacht” in the process.By the time the 1980s rolled around, black musicians had reclaimed the surging soul and quiet storm of yacht that was rightfully theirs. Artists such as George Benson, Lionel Richie and Raydio raised the bar by turning this “funked-up muzak” into a dance party. Ironically, an anthem called Africa turned out to be helmed by a clump of the whitest dudes going.

His comments were a direct counter to Corbyn, who had earlier called for MPs not to publicly attack staff or the shadow cabinet.That comment from Corbyn led several MPs to shout, “She’s sitting next to you” and point to shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who was demoted from her usual slot standing in for Corbyn at PMQs after she criticised the party’s Brexit policy on election night.In his speech before the interventions, the Labour leader said the party must unite to take on the “dangerously damaging policies” of the Tory leadership candidates, including tax cuts that will benefit the richest, attacks on abortion rights, and a “race-to-the-bottom no-deal Brexit”.He said Labour was committed to working cross-party to stop no deal. “To break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament,” he said.One Corbyn ally said they had been taken aback by the tone of the criticism. A Labour source called the meeting “robust”, but said it had not been worse than previous meetings.“Clearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country – and among Labour MPs. That’s no secret at all,” the source said.“We are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs … The PLP is very passionate, and that’s what we would expect.”Corbyn’s comments about ending the criticism of staff were taken to refer to Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who was criticised in leaked emails for her apparent handling of two harassment complaints, one against senior Labour aide David Prescott and another against Pete Willsman, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive committee who has since been suspended over allegations of antisemitism.Jess Phillips, the chair of the Women’s PLP, told the meeting the revelations were shameful. “If you abuse women in the Labour party and they’re a friend of yours, they get away with it,” she said, according to MPs in the room. Corbyn robustly denied that was the case, saying she should not have suggested that.MPs also expressed alarm that Corbyn’s opening speech failed to mention the investigation into antisemitism in the party that has been launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.The party’s handling of antisemitism cases was compared with the automatic expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections. Labour MP Wes Streeting suggested this was a double standard.Labour’s new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes, apologised to MPs at the meeting for liking Facebook posts that referred to “Zionist slavemasters”. But MPs including Margaret Hodge said Forbes had failed to address another aspect of the complaints, her signing of a letter criticising the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.Forbes said she had written to Jewish community groups and hoped to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a1a2b055b76f404eb8f864584c655761b905f79/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a984937e3e0b51cf76351233151fc2a","title":"eu view of tory leadership candidates deeply critical say sources","story":"Boris Johnson viewed as Trump-like figure while Dominic Raab accused of ‘making things up’The EU has been on a Brexit break since the UK secured a six-month delay to its departure. With Theresa May soon to leave 10 Downing Street, Brussels is tuning in to the Westminster drama of the Tory leadership race – with both amazement and exasperation.“People in Brussels are fed up that the political class in the UK has gone a little bit crazy,” Jean-Claude Piris, a former head of the European council’s legal service said. British politicians seemed to have gone “on holiday”, since gaining the extension, he added.For the EU, the bookies’ favourite Boris Johnson, is a Trumpian figure whose disputed claims and bombastic rhetoric played a major role in plunging the UK into what is seen in Brussels as the Brexit nightmare.The former foreign secretary is remembered for his early 1990s stint as Brussels correspondent of the Daily , where he made his name mocking EU regulations, promoting what the European commission calls “Euromyths”. He achieved wider prominence for his claims during the EU referendum campaign. “He lied a lot to the British people,” the then French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in 2016.“The idea of Boris Johnson in the European council is probably quite abhorrent to some EU leaders,” an EU source said. “Boris is known in foreign policy circles, certainly not respected. He’s also seen as part of a wider Trump world and no one wants that.”The EU’s most senior civil servant, Martin Selmayr, once described a Johnson premiership as a “horror scenario”, classing him with Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump.Many EU insiders think the chances of no deal have increased, with the Tory party expected to choose a Brexiter prime minister.“For me it is very clear the odds of no-deal Brexit are more than half and clearly if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister the odds will go up again,” said Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian MEP and member of the European parliament’s Brexit steering group.Another favourite, Dominic Raab, is held in low-esteem in Brussels. During his four-month tenure as Brexit secretary, he lost trust of his EU counterparts. “He was seen to be working against his prime minister and making things up,” the first EU source said.The European commission recently accused Raab of making “fraudulent” claims and spreading “pure disinformation” in a campaign video about the views of its secretary-general, Selmayr, on the future of Ireland.Responding to unfavourable reports from Brussels, Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show that it “probably tells you that I was doing my job in terms of pressing them hard and making sure that Britain’s interests were resolutely defended”.Candidates deemed compromise choices at Westminster have also inspired mistrust in Brussels. The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is reported to have struck a different tone on Brexit with his EU counterparts than the public stance he takes in the UK. “He gave a very different impression than what he is suggesting now,” an EU diplomat said. More recently, Hunt has toned down his views on no deal, warning it would be “political suicide”.EU officials expect Tory candidates will be falling over themselves to prove their hard-Brexit credentials, following the party’s poor showing in the European elections, where just four of its MEPs were elected and Nigel Farage’s Brexit party won the most votes. “The Tory party will be in survival mode and … will have to regain credibility as the party of Brexit,” another EU source said.The environment secretary is to pitch himself as a “unity candidate” capable of attracting leavers and remainers, as he formally declared his candidacy saying: “I believe that I’m ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist party, ready to deliver\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand ready to lead this great country.” But robust Brexiters in particular dislike the fact that he stayed loyal even in the final days of the crumbling May regime.The health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on, the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of\u0026nbspbeing apparently competent\u0026nbspand broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one. A concerted effort\u0026nbspwould probably require\u0026nbspan image consultant.The former immigration minister and chief whip\u0026nbsp was behind the controversial \u0027go-home\u0027 vans when working under Theresa May at the Home Office. He\u0026nbspresigned as immigration minister in 2014after it emerged he was employing a cleaner who did not have permission to work in the UK. He later served as David Cameron’s chief whip. But he has not served in Theresa May’s government and has, therefore, sought to cast himself as the candidate who offers \u0027fresh thinking.Fears that the foreign secretary would be another overly woolly compromise choice were hardly assuaged when after a set-piece speech he seemed\u0026nbspunable to outline\u0026nbspwhy his brand of Conservatism might appeal to voters. Hunt has been backed by Liam Fox.\u0026nbspThe home secretary still has the same weaknesses: he is an uninspiring speaker and some worry he is too fond of headline-grabbing,\u0026nbspilliberal political gestures.

But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider.The former work and pensions secretary, who\u0026nbspquit last year\u0026nbspover May’s Brexit plans, has\u0026nbsplaunched her own\u0026nbspin-party campaign groupleadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism, promising to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as erting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police.Few things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged\u0026nbspwith this imageawash with tasteful pastel hues. He formally launched his bid\u0026nbspin the Mail on Sunday. Among the more core constituency of Conservative MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official\u0026nbsp“Ready for Raab”\u0026nbspTwitter feed.The cabinet’s most recent arrival – Mordaunt’s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary – certainly has the necessary\u0026nbspambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism. He\u0027s become a social media darling and been endorsed by Ken Clarke, but his reputation as \u0027Florence of Belgravia\u0027 may hinder him.For many, the leadership race is an unedifying fight for power, while the clock ticks down remorselessly to Brexit day on 31 October.More governments are coming round to the tough position of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who argued against a long extension on the grounds that Brexit would become a damaging and distracting burden for the EU.Donald Tusk, the European council president, helped persuade member states to back a longer extension, which he urged the UK not to waste.“We were definitely on the other side of Macron,” the diplomat recalled. “Now I think Macron was right. We were wrong. Tusk was wrong.”Asked about the Tory contest last month, Tusk said there was “nothing promising” in “the state of affairs in London”.Many in the EU would support an extension for what is known in Brussels as “a democratic event”, meaning a general election or a second referendum.Without that, Piris thinks EU leaders could say no to a further extension. “But even if they say yes. What would happen? There is an inability to solve this question in the House of Commons.”He stresses the Brexit conundrum is not down to an inidual Tory leader. “It is a question of the political system of the UK being unable to answer to such a unique event in the life of the nation.”Lamberts warns that nothing will change for May’s successor, as the EU will refuse to reopen the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish backstop. “Anyone who steps into Downing Street will face exactly the same constraints. Saying you want to renegotiate this agreement is nice and well, but it won’t happen,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1155542ab31f1196850a7565e29a3dff13ac0788/0_124_3699_2220/master/3699.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec6c0ce7260d2e9dbb1983a357a4185","title":"matt hancock refuses to rule out staying in eu after 31 october","story":"Tory leadership frontrunner avoids interviews and refuses to commit to TV hustingsBoris Johnson has been accused of “not having the guts to face the people” in the Conservative leadership race, coming under fire for dodging interviews and refusing to confirm his participation in a BBC debate with other candidates.Johnson, the clear frontrunner with MPs and the Tory membership, was implicitly criticised by several of his rivals who said the race must put all the candidates under proper scrutiny.The former foreign secretary is expected to launch his campaign on Wednesday, when he will face some media questioning. However, he has refused to say whether he will appear on a televised hustings next Tuesday and has avoided broadcast interviews.All 10 candidates have been invited to the BBC debate, with Michael Gove, Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom and Mark Harper having all confirmed to the  that they would take part.If Johnson takes questions at his campaign launch, he is likely to be asked about his admission of having taken cocaine at university, after the controversy over Gove’s use of class-A drugs.Johnson has done just one newspaper interview, with the Sunday Times, and no major broadcast interviews since the campaign began, and has only made paid corporate appearances in Manchester and Switzerland. His main policy announcements have been made through his Daily  columns, for which he is also paid.Several of the other candidates appeared to criticise Johnson for apparently trying to get through the next few weeks of voting among MPs without too much scrutiny of his policies and views.Harper, one of the outsiders, said all candidates must be open to public questioning and scrutiny, and that any other route would risk a similar situation to the 2017 general election, when Theresa May’s campaign style stumbled.“If you want to lead this country, you have to be prepared to set out your stall,” he said. “I think you have to open yourself up to questioning and be prepared to level with people and be questioned about it. We had a general election campaign two years ago and the prime minister demonstrated she was not as good at campaigning as we all thought she would be.”Hancock added: “I certainly think that everybody who puts their name forward to be prime minister should be open to scrutiny, should be accountable.“Everybody should participate in the proposed TV debates. And I think we’ve got to ask the question: why not? I’ve got nothing to hide and that’s why I am here.”David Lammy, a Labour MP who supports the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, criticised Johnson for wanting to “force a destructive no deal on our country, when he doesn’t have the guts to face the people”.“Saying nothing, other than through a lucrative column in the , is no way for a potential prime minister to conduct themselves. The country is crying out for leadership, not cowardice.”Johnson’s strategy does not appear to have harmed his chances with MPs. He won several more high-profile backers on Tuesday, with the former contender Kit Malthouse and former leader Iain Duncan Smith both supporting him. He now has at least 65 MPs behind him, making it very likely he will make the shortlist of two candidates to be put to a vote of the membership.The controversy came as Leadsom launched her campaign, insisting that parliament would be unable to block a no-deal Brexit and that the 31 October deadline was a “hard red line” for her.Leadsom, who resigned as the leader of the Commons last month, claimed her plans for a “managed Brexit” would be likely to win over both MPs and the EU27 – but even if MPs objected, they would not be able to force the government to extend article 50.While MPs forced May’s hand in March to ask for an extension, Leadsom said: “I do not think that parliament actually has the ability to prevent us leaving at the end of October.”In contrast, Hancock refused to rule out extending Britain’s membership of the EU beyond October, but insisted he could secure a time limit to the backstop from the EU that would pass parliament.The health secretary said his rival candidates who had pledged to leave – deal or no deal – by 31 October were making false promises because parliament would block any no-deal departure.He said the outcome would be a general election, which would be a “catastrophe for my party and extremely damaging for the country”.Hancock claimed his plan for renegotiation was detailed, “unlike some of the other candidates”, and would involve first putting a deal to parliament that included a backstop with a time limit, to prove to the EU27 that it could pass. He would then restart the negotiations.The backstop is a device intended to ensure there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.The environment secretary is to pitch himself as a “unity candidate” capable of attracting leavers and remainers, as he formally declared his candidacy saying: “I believe that I’m ready to unite the Conservative and Unionist party, ready to deliver\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand ready to lead this great country.” But robust Brexiters in particular dislike the fact that he stayed loyal even in the final days of the crumbling May regime.The health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on, the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of\u0026nbspbeing apparently competent\u0026nbspand broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one.

Once you have a majority in the House of Commons things can move quickly,” he said.All the leadership candidates will take part in private hustings before the vote, with the first round taking place on Tuesday night.Defending Johnson, the former defence secretary Michael Fallon said he hoped the contest would not focus on personalities.“There’s a wide range of candidates but I hope we can agree to leave some of the personal stuff out of this … in the end we have all got to rally round, support the new prime minister, bring the party together again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa01e40cd388afe698532d01bcb01e12a803cfd/21_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8019211ada424a1545e92127544ddac","title":"tory leadership campaigns hancock claims early commons brexit vote could lead to eu offering backstop concessions live news","story":"Three more Tory leadership candidates – Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart – launch their campaignsSky’s Sam Coates has more on what happened at cabinet this morning.And this is from the ’s Steven Swinford.The 1922 Committee leadership hustings have just started. They are in a Commons committee room, and journalists are not allowed in. Here are some tweets from reporters outside the door.This is from the Mirror’s Pippa Crerar on the Tory leadership contest.At her press gallery lunch Andrea Leadsom, the Tory leadership candidate and former leader of the Commons, said she would not rule out allowing a second Scottish independence referendum. She explained:The reason I say ‘never say never’ is because I do not think that there should be another independence referendum in Scotland, I do not think it’s in their interest, but on the other hand I am a big believer in devolution. So, what I just want to say is I am not going to stand here and utterly rule it out because I think that that is disrespectful. But I would very strongly fight against a second referendum, which I don’t think is in the interest of Scotland and it’s definitely not in the interests of the UK. What I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the UK working together far stronger, far more than we have done and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen.Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, was speaking at a press gallery lunch this afternoon. She seems to have found a new slogan for her leadership campaign. This is from the Suns’ Matt Dathan.According to my colleague Rowena Mason, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said at cabinet this morning that he needed an extra £1bn for no-deal planning.Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now Facebook’s head of global affairs, also spoke at the Times CEO summit. He told the event he thought the chances of a no-deal Brexit were increasing:I think the chances of a no-deal outcome have accelerated because the Conservative party, as they always do, have put their own survival ahead of the survival of the union of the United Kingdom. And they decided that delivering Brexit, however that economically impacts today, is absolutely imperative for their survival.Michael Gove, the environment secretary and Tory leadership candidate, has rejected claims that the Brexit vote has led to an increase in hate crime - even though a Home Office report says it did.He was speaking at the Times CEO event, where he was asked by the Times columnist Rachel Sylvester if he was ashamed of the anti-immigration tone adopted by the Vote Leave campaign that he ran in 2016 with Boris Johnson. Sylvester said she had recently interviewed a chief constable who thought the Brexit process had led to an increase in hate crime. Gove replied:I would disagree with that. One of the things that is striking is that since the referendum result attitudes towards migration in Britain have changed. When Sylvester put it to him that hate crime had risen, Gove replied:I would contest that too. Attitudes towards migration have changed. We are now the country in Europe with the most positive attitude towards migration. I remember talking to Ruth Davidson just before we were both speaking at the Scottish Conservative conference. And Ruth said to me: “I’m a remainer down to my boots, but the one thing I do have to grant, Michael, is that your argument is right. If people feel they have control over migration, then their attitude towards it becomes more relaxed and liberal.Gove has made the argument about Britain becoming more pro-immigration since 2016 before, and there is evidence to back this up. People seem to worry about immigration less, and appreciate its benefits more. The UK also comes near the top in an EU survey asking if people are happy having an immigrant as a neighbour, although the government and the media are very anti-immigrant by EU standards. See here and here for all the details.But his claim about Brexit and hate crime flies in the face of official evidence. A Home Office report on hate crime (pdf) published in October 2017 said:In 2018, when another set of crime figures was published, the Home Office also said that there were “spikes in hate crime following certain events such as the EU referendum”. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary has also said there is a link between Brexit and hate crime.Dee Collins, who was recently interviewed by Sylvester before retiring as chief constable of West Yorkshire police, also insisted there was a link. “Brexit has enabled some people to feel able to behave and say things in a particular way. So I think there is a real nervousness in the Muslim community and indeed other communities about faith-based hate crime,” Collins told the Times (£).At the Times CEO event Gove was asked if he was proud of the way he ran the Vote Leave campaign. He defended it strongly, saying:You are always run any campaign better. I could certainly have run aspects of past leadership campaigns better. But the argument that we made was that our migration policy should be based not on an arbitrary target, “tens of thousands”, but on what was right for our economy, and that simply because somebody happened to be a citizen of Bulgaria rather than Bangladesh, that should not mean that they should automatically have an advantage.In the past, when asked the same question, Gove has been more willing to concede that he was not entirely happy with the way the campaign stoked fears about Turkish immigration.Nicola Sturgeon has accused the UK government of undermining Scotland’s interests by refusing to allow the Foreign Office to support her trip to Brussels.Scotland’s first minister is in the Belgian capital, where she met the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. She will hold talks later on Tuesday with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, as part of a trip during which she is pitching for an independent Scotland to join the EU.As her visit was deemed to be about undermining the integrity of the UK, rather than her devolved responsibilities, Jeremy Hunt blocked the Foreign Office from offering any logistical support for the visit, the Daily  reported.Sturgeon played down the impact, saying it had not made “any practical difference to us” because the Scottish government had its own team in Brussels. She said: If there is a serious aspect to this it is another example of the UK government trying to undermine a devolved government’s efforts trying to protect the interests of our country.She also suggested that Hunt - one of the frontrunners in the Tory leadership race - was probably “playing to the audience of Tory party members”.Speaking to an audience at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, she contrasted the EU’s solidarity with Ireland with the UK government’s attitudes to devolved administrations on Brexit, claiming Edinburgh had been ignored - a view echoed in Cardiff.Her speech set out the case for an independent Scotland to join the EU. The Scottish government will exert a positive influence wherever we can in the wider debate about UK membership, but in the spirit of international cooperation and solidarity we also desire the option of taking our own place in Europe.Sturgeon spoke warmly about the EU as a peace project and vehicle for cooperation on the climate crisis, but she did not hide her criticism of some policies, including the common fisheries policy, which is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishing communities.Sturgeon said that was within the margin of error. An independent Scotland would also face difficult questions over its future currency and border with the UK.The first minister declined to say what would happen to the ScotlandUK border if Scotland joined the EU, while the UK was outside. She said Scotland “shouldn’t have to choose between the two”, adding that it would also depend on the UK’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU.Esther McVey has challenged other candidates in the contest to be the next Tory leader to join her in committing to restoring free TV-licenses for the over 75s. Criticising the BBC, she said she was ashamed of its decision to make most over 75s pay. But she did not commit government funding to reverse the decision, instead suggesting that the BBC should cut back on other services to provide them. She said:The BBC was told that it could increase the licence fee if it covered free TV licences for over 75s. It now seems to have broken the terms of that deal and millions of pensioners will have to pay for their licences.My aim is to make sure that the BBC do not benefit financially from breaking their promise and I would want to do everything we can to ensure that all over 75s get the free TV licences they deserve.Q: You say it would be crazy to walk away from the EU if, by 31 October, you were close to a deal. What would that look like?Gove says that would involve changes to the political declaration, and changes to the backstop.Sylvester has now opened it up to questions from the audience.Q: What makes you think a majority of the country still want to leave?Gove says he thinks that is what polling shows. Some leavers have changed their mind, but there are remainers who accept that Brexit has to be delivered.Q: But young people don’t want to leave, and more and more of them are turning 18 the longer this goes on.Gove says some young people were passionately in favour of leaving.He says no one defends the common agricultural policy. He says his approach to reforming the CAP has been widely backed.Q: Will you stay in this race? Is it to prove something to your parents?Gove says he owes a huge amount to his parents, but that he is in the contest because he has worked with two different PMs and he thinks he has the experience to deliver.Q: You are not going to give up?No, he says.Q: Do you still think Johnson is an election winner for the Tories? He seems to have lost the remain vote.Gove says he thinks people look afresh at someone when they become prime minister.A new PM will be given the chance to prove themselves, he says.Q: Is Johnson the candidate most likely to win a general election?Gove says he has been watching the new documentary series about Margaret Thatcher. It was said she was too isive to win an election, and that she was too interested in ideas. But she won elections. He says he thinks electability is more complex than people think.Q: Is she your heroine?Gove says Teddy Roosevelt is more of a hero for him.Roosevelt recognised that you need to reform capitalism to save it.Q: Have you been surprised by the backlash there has been against you over drugs? John McDonnell told the Times CEO summit this morning he could not afford to take drugs when he was young, but you did not have a privileged background either.Gove says there are good arguments about how to approach drugs policy, but those arguments do not apply to what iniduals do.Q: Why did you succumb to frailty and take drugs? Did you want to be part of a gilded elite?No, says Gove. He says he thinks he had a privileged background. He was loved as a child.Q: Do voters care about this?Gove says he thinks people look at politicians in the round. He says he thinks he has shown in office that he can deliver.Q: Are there issues about Boris Johnson’s private life?No, says Gove. He says he thinks Johnson should just be judged on the issues.He says there should be two tests for potential tax cuts: do they power growth, and do they help the least well off in society?He says a tax cut that would help the wealthiest pensioners most of all would not achieve either of these two aims.I think that there are two tests that I would apply to any tax cut. Does it par economic growth and does it help the most disadvantaged in our society? A tax cut that concentrates on helping the wealthiest pensioners most of all is not a tax cut which either improves productivity or generates a greater level of social equity.Q: In 2016 you said Boris Johnson was incapable of being a good PM. Have you changed your mind?Yes, says Gove. He says all the candidates are good.Q: Do you think he has the attention to detail to be a good PM?We will find out in this campaign, he says.Gove says there is no polling evidence to suggest the Tories could win a general election without having delivered Brexit.Q: Would you ever do a deal with Nigel Farage?Gove says he is a Conservative. Farage leads a different party. They have a different approach.Q: I spoke to a police officer recently who said that the Brexit campaign had led to an increase in hate crimes. Do you regret the way you ran the 2016 referendum campaign.No, says Gove. He says Britons have become more pro-immigrant since the campaign.Gove says he does not accept that. He says Ruth Davidson, a remainer, says the leave campaign was right in the arguments it made about immigration.Michael Gove, the environment secretary and a Tory leadership candidate, is speaking at the Times CEO summit. He is being interviewed by the Times columnist Rachel Sylvester.Q: Did you underestimate how complicated Brexit would be?Gove says he always knew leaving the EU would be complicated, and he was opposed to rushing the decision to trigger article 50. That decision was taken when he was not in government. Jeremy Corbyn said article 50 should be triggered immediately, he says.Q: The civil service analysis of a no-deal Brexit is hair-raising.

But shamefully, over a thousand Sure Start centres have been lost through years of austerity, meaning children and families across the country are missing out.”According to a 2018 study by the Sutton Trust, as many as 1,000 Sure Start children’s centres may have been shut down in England since 2010.What does Sure Start mean to you?

Never in the history of cricket had it happened thrice in a single week but increasingly high-scoring has come to seem commonplace, assisted by powerplays, fielding restrictions, multiple new balls and countless technical and physical improvements and innovations.In 1,322 ODI innings in the 20 years following the first ODI in January 1971, despite many of them lasting 60 or 55 overs, the score of 300 was reached only 22 times (that is once every 60 innings) by the time the sun set on 11 May, and despite none of them lasting more than 50 overs, there had been 24 scores of 300-plus in 2019 at a rate of one in five.The transformation of the one-day game has been long and meandering but the search for the first ODI of the recognisably modern style, the very first game in which runs were scored at the kind of rate that was once considered superhuman and is now considered almost quotidian, is not impossible. The surprise is that even in a sport as obsessed with precedent and history as cricket, the game that best fits the bill has been practically forgotten.Even at the time nobody took much notice. It must have seemed like a wild anomaly, the last fixture of Sri Lanka’s 1986-87 tour of India and so perhaps explicable as a few demob-happy sportsmen getting out of hand at Mumbai. When India Today published a summary of the tour at the end of January 1987 its final game was not even mentioned, the entire series dismissed as an experience that “could at best be regarded as batting and bowling practice for the Indians”.When Reuters, in its report on the match, sought an adjective to describe Sri Lanka’s run chase the best it could come up with was “gallant”, while Wisden went with “brave”. This was after the team became the third in the history of ODI cricket, after West Indies’ wild thrashing of India in Jamshedpur in 1983 and the Indians themselves that very morning, to score at seven-an-over-or-above across an innings lasting more than 30 overs, and the first to do it batting second (something that next happened in 1997, and then again in 2006).India would have to wait another nine years before they first scored 300 or more off 50 overs that day they scored 299 off 40. In the four previous ODIs in the series 1,357 runs had been scored at 4.40 an over in the final fixture 588 runs were scored at 7.35, with Sri Lanka making 289 for seven off their 40.This was the first game in the history of ODI cricket in which two teams batted their full allocation of overs while scoring a run a ball or more. At that point the only vaguely comparable matches were India’s in Lahore on New Year’s Eve 1982, which was rained off after the 27th over of India’s innings, Pakistan’s against New Zealand in Faisalabad in November 1984, which was turned into the first Twenty20 international because of a morning downpour, and England’s against India in January 1985, the first international cricket match in Chandigarh and a game that would probably have been cancelled due to an overnight thunderstorm were it not for the fact that – in the words of the ’s Matthew Engel – “a total abandonment in conditions that had improved into bright sunshine would probably have caused a riot, and the teams knew what was good for them”.They got 15 overs each and “the game that resulted was inevitably one of slogs, snicks and leg-byes, with little dignity and less art cricket for people who do not like cricket much”.With Indian attention turning to the imminent visit by Pakistan, whose first ODI was 10 days away, everyone seemed too busy to notice that history was being played out in front of them. They saw a first one-day century from the 23-year-old Mohammad Azharuddin (like his second and his third, he got 108). It was the second time an Indian had scored a century at more than a run a ball, after Kapil Dev’s unbeaten 175 against Zimbabwe at the 1983 World Cup, when India were on their way to the trophy and Zimbabwe, having beaten Australia in their first game, were engaged in what amounted to little more than an extended victory lap.Kris Srikkanth’s 27-ball 46 was the first innings by an Indian opener at a strike rate above 150 (the next eight entries on the list are all Sachin Tendulkar). Sri Lanka’s Roshan Mahanama was 20 years old, 12 games into a 213-match ODI career and had never scored more than 26 runs, or any total at more than a run a ball by the time he was run out at Mumbai he had smashed 98 off 91 (though India won, Mahanama was the man of the match).Asanka Gurusinha was 21, playing the 14th of this 147 ODIs, and hit 52 off 34 balls at a strike rate of 152.94, an innings without equal in his career (he averaged a strike rate of 60.88, rising to 73.62 when he scored 50 or more). Kapil Dev, bowling off a shortened run-up and at reduced pace with his thigh strapped, went at 7.55 an over, the fourth-worst figures of his 225-game ODI career (in terms of economy it was also Madan Lal’s second-worst display, Ashantha de Mel’s second-worst and Ravi Ratnayeke’s fourth-worst the spinner Shivlal Yadav, nine days before his 30th birthday, went at 7.40 an over and never played another ODI such was the chaos that the Sri Lanka spinner Don Anurasiri never bowled at all).With Sri Lanka 34 runs from victory and on course to achieve it, De Mel was bowled by Kapil, bringing Ravi Ratnayeke out to partner the unrelated Rumesh Ratnayake, and Ravi’s puzzlingly pedestrian contribution of five runs off 11 balls proved decisive. The tourists ran out of time still 11 runs from victory. Despite Ravi’s efforts this was the only time in the 20th century that both teams in a match of 40 or more overs had ended their innings with a run rate above seven (by contrast, it happened four times in England matches between the start of 2019 and the start of the World Cup). The game’s place in history was secure, even if its place in memory, it seems, was not.• This is an extract taken from the Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Bye!“Me again,” says Steve Pye. “I’m not sure I’ve changed much into my adult life. I recently told my colleagues that on the first day of every English cricket Test summer since 1994 I’ve always eaten a Toblerone. I don’t know why, I’m just odd. One of my colleagues turned to me and said, ‘How did you ever get married?’ Harsh, but probably fair.” I didn’t know you worked with your wife. Honk.“My least favourite washout was the Ashes at the Oval in 2013,” writes Guy Hornsby. “My cricket mad friend Mel was due to attend her first Ashes Test but our enthusiasm was gradually wrung out of us (literally) by torrential rain from before play. We never even sat in our seats. Obviously we found liquid ways to pass the time, but I’ll never get over the fact I missed Ian Bell make a not-quite-enough 43 off 145 balls in a drawn Test. There’s no justice.”Pop quiz: what unusual feat did Ian Bell achieve during the 2013 Ashes? And who else achieved it in the same series?I suspect the match will be officially abandoned at approximately 2.27pm. Even if it never rains again in Bristol, the outfield won’t be playable for a few hours. Dear rain, please do one“While I hope paying punters get to see a bit of cricket, I’m not sure I’d like to see a number of quasi-T20 group games that may determine which team gets to go through to the latter stages,” says Neill Brown. “An arbitrary draw, based on weather andor the toss of a coin (at the end of the round robin), is a far better fit for cricket hosted in England. Also, if it all goes T20 and every ball is deemed sacred, we’ll be denied my new favourite thing in sport, namely Chris Gayle calmly, yet forcefully, refusing an easy single while he contemplates his next attempt to biff whatever comes his way over cow corner.”I also like his extravagant, slow-motion leaves outside off stump, which he occasionally produces even in a T20 match.Here’s our latest World Cup bulletin from Matthew Weaver.“Afternoon Rob,” says Dave Adams. “Steve Pye’s question took me back to the early 90s too. I was about 14 at the time and I was aware that Hampshire were playing in Portsmouth that week in JuneJuly. I legged it home from school and looked up page 340 on Ceefax. Hampshire were batting and David Ivon Gower was one of the not out batsmen. “I rushed to the station, hopped on a train, and got to the ground only to find they’d just gone off due to what barely qualified as ‘light drizzle’. So I sat there, on my own, bored out of my mind until play was officially abandoned for the day with no further play possible. Great days. “Obviously today there is no Ceefax, Hampshire don’t play in Portsmouth, and the weather app on my phone would’ve told me not to bother leaving the house. That’s progress, apparently.”“I take it none of your readers today are South African,” says Andrew Cosgrove, “or they would all have emailed in with the infamous semi-final of the 1992 World Cup.” The daftest thing about that game is the South Africa won the toss and elected to field. I’ve done some stupid things in my time, but none of th... actually, on reflection, quite a few of them have been more stupid than that. But it was still an exceedingly stupid decision to bat second given the rain rules in that tournament.“Two days in a row?” sniffs Matt Dony. “I’m running a serious risk of being productive at work. Steven Pye’s have just struck a chord, though. Wondering why no one at school finds us attractive. If ever there was an OBO calling card, this it. Alan Partridge famously finished chapters of his book with, ‘Needless to say, I had the last laugh.’ From now on, I’ll probably finish most of my emails with, ‘And I wondered why no one fancied me in school...’”Those lonely teenage years never leave you, eh, even when you’re happily grown up with three children and 12 wives. Here’s Pete Salmon on the subject of exasperating rain delays|Can’t believe no one has mentioned the semi final of the Ferntree Gully Cricket Association Thirds in 199091. We - Upwey - had snuck into fourth and rolled the undefeated top team, Ferndale for 82. ‘Horse Clarke’ finished with 6 for not many, and even I got a couple. We were 1 for 43 at stumps. High 30s all week, then the following Saturday it peed down the whole day. The next week, Ferndale beat Ferntree Gully - who we’d defated twice that year - in the Grand Final, to take the pennant, $200 cash and a meat tray. Still bitter.”The cut-off time is 4.15pm. Those at the ground suggestt there is approximately 0.00 per cent chance of the match starting by then.“Yuvraj Singh is the most impactful white-ball cricketer (perhaps even the greatest ever) to have played for India,” says Abhijato Sensarma. “Discuss.”Well, I wouldn’t abuse you on social media for that opinion. Interesting that nobody really includes Gambhir in this discussion. (Most impactful, that is, not greatest.)“Anybody else remember Lancs v Derbyshire at Buxton in June ‘75?” asks Peter Hutchinson. “SNOW!!!!”“Frustrating rain delays? Scotland v West Indies in Harare last year is still fresh in the memory,” says Simon McMahon, driving his nails down a chalkboard to enter the appropriate headspace. “Although I suppose what happened allows me to state that had the rain not intervened, Scotland would be lifting the cricket World Cup at Lord’s next month.”“Hi Rob,” says Steve Pye. “Not sure how I forgot the trauma of Trinidad in 1990 - that’s one for the amateur psychologists out there - but as soon as you mentioned that match, my heart sank. I was 14 at the time, and took the time to construct a tally chart with 151 lines on it to cross out during the run chase. And I wondered why none of the girls at my school found me attractive?!”If only you’d been the boy in this advert, eh.There’s plenty going on in the County Championship, including a lively counter-attack from the hugely promising Ollie Robinson at Canterbury. Get the latest news with Tanya Aldred.“Your royal highness,” writes Sohid Ahmed. “Seeing there is no cricket imminent, can we talk about the most elegant left hander in the game who just announced his retirement? The one who took six sixes off Broad? A shame he did not get a proper farewell.”The BCCI will organise a farewell match for Yuvraj, surely? Just in case you missed it, there’s a quite brilliant tribute to him on Cricinfo from Sharda Ugra.“The Spin details the first modern ODI in 1987,” says Don Wilson, “but I seem to remember that the last truly old fashioned ODI, played in whites with a red ball, was in the late 90s, between India and Zimbabwe I think?”The memory on you! It was December 2000 rather than the late 90s - but even so, I’m giving you full points.The planned 12.15pm inspection has been postponed. I shan’t insult your intelligence by telling you why it has been postponed. “The 2007 rain at Lord’s vs. India gets my vote,” says Matt Salkeld, on the subject of exasperating examples of cricketus interruptus. “Personally though, the rain-affected Saturday of the Lord’s Test against NZ in ‘90 sticks in my mind. It was my first-ever match and my 13-year old self was not long on patience. As it turned out, the drizzle was standing between me and the enjoymenttorment of a nuggety 185-run opening partnership between John Wright and Trevor Franklin. NZ’s eight-foot, big-jawed opening bat was not in expansive mood, as his strike rate of 32 showed...”You should have seen him at Bengaluru in 1988. Mind you, it’s hard to begrudge him even a single dot ball after his leg was shattered by a motorised luggage trolley at Gatwick during the 1986 tour. “Dear Rob,” writes Varun Mathure. Thought it was worth sharing that if Bangladesh v Sri Lanka is called off it would be the seventh time (eighth if you include the India v Sri Lanka semi-final game from CWC ‘96) that a game involving Sri Lanka at the World Cup would be either abandoned or not take place due to extenuating circumstances (again ‘96 and the two walkovers against Australia and West Indies). “Outside of that little tidbit, whilst the weather gods have been particularly unfavourable this year, I am incredulous that there seems to be no planning from the ICC on how to prevent the tournament not being majorly influenced by the weather. This would be the third washout and we could easily see that number rise to five by the end of this week. No wonder then that we are seeing the game lose out on public interest and ECB coming up with the bemusing idea of the Hundred in an effort to keep the masses engaged.”I suspect the weather has caught them cold (and wet, and miserable, etc). I don’t know enough about the logistics of reserve days to know whether they were a realistic option, but I do have sympathy for the ICC given this could be the wettest June in history. And at least the rain delay allows you to feed tasty tidbits to the OBO community. “Hi Rob, I’m a cricket fan from Spain,” says Carlos Pérez. “I’m travelling with my brother to Chester-le-street to watch Sri Lanka v South Africa on the 28th. I’m scared!! It’s going to be my first time watching cricket live and I don’t want the game to be rained off!! Let’s organise the World Cup in sunny Spain instead, shall we?”I wouldn’t worry. The weather has been so contrary of late that you’ll probably have a Durham heatwave.“Morning Rob,” writes Matt Emerson. “I’m old enough to clearly remember the 1980 Centenary Test at Lord’s, when the rain interruptions led to umpire David Constant being assaulted by an MCC member and Greg Chappell being shocked, shocked! by the members’ language. Yes, that Greg Chappell. A fuller account is here.”“Kind Sir,” writes John Barnes. “Everyone is questioning the wisdom of a World Cup in England with our unpredictable weather - which makes me wonder the following: how many games in previous World Cups staged in England were washed out? We’ve held it f0ur times so it can’t be a horrendous amount that have been lost.” They had reserve days in all of the previous tournaments. There was still one washout in 1979, Sri Lanka v West Indies, and another in 1999 (Zimbabwe v New Zealand).“I thought you might be bored,” writes professional mindreader Steve Pye, “so I thought I’d try and start some kind of discussion related to cricket and rain. When were you most frustrated by a weather interruption in cricket? As an England fan, bad light at Lord’s against India in 2007 springs to mind. This was also frustrating at the time. England leading South Africa by 289 with three wickets left, against a strong South African team, only for rain to wash out the last day.”Trinidad 1990, always. England would have been 2-0 up with two to play, and a draw away from the biggest upset in cricket history. Any others?Here’s David Peters, with a question inspired by today’s Spin“I’ve been wondering (‘though India won, Mahanama was the man of the match’), how often is a player from the losing team named Man of the Match?” From memory, though I’d need to check this, it has happened 66 times in Tests, 245 times in ODIs and 18 times in IT20s.There will be an inspection at 12.15pm. Meanwhile, here’s some more injury news.“Is there anything in the rules preventing India from replacing Dhawan and then bringing him back three weeks later?” says Ian Forth, who didn’t get the salutations memo.Yes, there is – when you replace a player it’s for life, not just for Christmas. They could theoretically bring Dhawan back in to replace another injured player, but that injury would need to be verified by the ICC. Which reminds me, I need to finish my screenplay about an unused squad member at a Cricket World Cup who is attacked by a hatchet man armed with only a pair of pliers and a clear understanding of the ICC regulations regarding the replacement of injured players.“Sir,” says Sanjay Pareek, who could TEACH THE REST OF YOU A THING OR TWO ABOUT SALUTATIONS, “what time will the match start?”No time has been set for an inspection, never mind for the match to start. I would say the likeliest scenario is that it will be washed out, as light rain is forecast for most of the day. “The ICC should have considered the English weather conditions before organizing such a huge cricketing event at this point in time,” says Iqbal Rehan, “as the results may not be the true reflector due to limited opportunities to the teams because of rain.”I have a fair bit of sympathy for the ICC, because this is forecast to be the wettest June in history, and you can’t really plan for that. I suppose they could have had Michael Fish on the organising committee.Something for the rain breakThere has actually been a prompt start in a few of the County Championship games. Get the latest news with the irritatingly brilliant Tanya Aldred.“Isn’t keeping Dhawan a no-brainer?” asks Andrew Hurley. “Rahul opens, and they have a couple of middle order options. They have also already beaten Australia so they have already some margin for error in their games against the other top teams. “Yes, completely agree. Unless he’s out for six weeks it would verge on weird for them to replace him, and nobody wants to verge.The forecast for the next few days is not exactly life-affirming, although it does get better towards the weekend. India v New Zealand looks like it will be washed out.Wednesday Australia v Pakistan, Taunton Overcast changing to light rain in the afternoonFriday England v West Indies, SouthamptonCloudy changing to light showers by late morningSaturday Sri Lanka v Australia, The OvalCloudy changing to sunny intervals by late morningSaturday South Africa v Afghanistan, CardiffCloudy changing to sunny intervals by late morningSunday India v Pakistan, Old TraffordSunny intervals changing to light showers by late morningWeather latest It’s still wet, it’s still not happening. Ach. Imagine scheduling a World Cup in England during the rainy season.And if you’d like to read about the first truly modern ODI, a match that went unnoticed at the time, this week’s Spin will make you happy.If you’d like to follow the rain in other parts of the country, with the occasional interruption by cricket, here’s our county blog.Injury news Indian’s ICC tournament specialist Shikhar Dhawan suffered a fractured thumb against Australia on Sunday and will be out for an unspecified period of time. There is talk of India replacing him. To me, that would be daft. They would qualify for the semi-finals if they had me opening the batting in his place, so surely they should keep him in the squad on the assumption he’ll be fit for the knockout games. The first semi-final isn’t until 9 July.In other news departmentI say pre-match.

We’ve had two washouts in the last four days, and things don’t look too pretty in Bristol this morning. Brizzle is made for mizzle and drizzle, but sadly the weather in the last 24 hours has more of a phonetic connection with somewhere like Teresópolis.Yes, I know it’s an imperfect rhyme. I’m doing my best. Come on, work with me here!There are some games, in football parlance, when both sides are happy to take a point. Bangladesh v Sri Lanka is not one of them. Both teams will have marked this as a must-win if they are to reach the semi-finals.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

One aim is to “strong-arm” the US and the former colonial powers the UK and France out of the region. Another is to see off “pro-western” uprisings, the documents say.In 2018 the US special counsel Robert Mueller indicted Prigozhin, who is known as “Putin’s chef” because of his Kremlin catering contracts. According to Mueller, his troll factory ran an extensive social media campaign in 2016 to help elect Donald Trump. The Wagner group – a private military contractor linked to Prigozhin – has supplied mercenaries to fight in Ukraine and Syria.The documents show the scale of Prigozhin-linked recent operations in Africa, and Moscow’s ambition to turn the region into a strategic hub. Multiple firms linked to the oligarch, including Wagner, are known by employees as the “Company”. Its activities are coordinated with senior officials inside Russia’s foreign and defence ministries, the documents suggest.Putin showed little interest in Africa in the 2000s. But western sanctions imposed in 2014 over the annexation of Crimea have driven Moscow to seek new geopolitical friends and business opportunities.Russia has a military presence and peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic. CAR is described as “strategically important” and a “buffer zone between the Muslim north and Christian south”. It allows Moscow to expand “across the continent”, and Russian companies to strike lucrative mineral deals, the documents say.On 24 May the Kremlin announced it was dispatching a team of army specialists to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press spokesman, they will service Russian-made military equipment. So far Moscow has signed military cooperation deals with about 20 African states.Five days later the Kremlin said it would host the first ever Russia-Africa summit in October in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Putin and Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, will chair the event. About 50 African leaders are due to attend. The aim is to foster political, economic and cultural cooperation.The leaked documents were obtained by the Dossier Center, an investigative unit based in London. The centre is funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian businessman and exiled Kremlin critic.Prigozhin has been approached for comment. He has previously denied any links to the troll factory and has said of Wagner that it does not exist. Putin has previously said that entities linked to Prigozhin do not constitute the Russian state.A map from December 2018 seen by the  shows the level of cooperation between the “Company” and African governments, country by country. Symbols indicate military, political and economic ties, police training, media and humanitarian projects, and “rivalry with France”. Five is the highest level one is the lowest.The closest relations are with CAR, Sudan and Madagascar – all put at five. Libya, Zimbabwe and South Africa are listed as four, according to the map, with South Sudan at three, and DRC, Chad and Zambia at two.Other documents cite Uganda, Equatorial Guinea and Mali as “countries where we plan to work”. Libya and Ethiopia are flagged as nations “where cooperation is possible”. The Kremlin has recently stepped up its ground operation in Libya. Last November the Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar travelled to Moscow and met the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. Prigozhin was spotted at the talks. Egypt is described as “traditionally supportive”.In Madagascar the new president, Andry Rajoelina, won election with “the Company’s support”, the map says. Russia “produced and distributed the island’s biggest newspaper, with 2 million copies a month”, it adds. Rajoelina denies receiving assistance.Another key territory is Sudan. Last year Russian specialists drew up a programme of political and economic reform, designed to keep President Omar al-Bashir in power. It included a plan to smear anti-government protesters, apparently copy-pasted from tactics used at home against the anti-Putin opposition. (One memo mistakenly says “Russia” instead of “Sudan”.)One ploy was to use fake news and videos to portray demonstrators in Khartoum and other Sudanese cities as “anti-Islam”, “pro-Israel” and “pro-LGBT”. The government was told to increase the price of newsprint – to make it harder for critics to get their message out – and to discover “foreigners” at anti-government rallies.In a leaked letter Prigozhin wrote to Bashir complaining that the president had not actually followed through on the advice. Prigozhin mentioned “lack of activity” by the Sudanese government and its “extremely cautious position”.The military deposed Bashir in April in a coup. Last week Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters, killing over a hundred. The Russian advisers had urged Sudan’s military council to suppress the activists with “minimal but acceptable loss of life”, one former regime source told CNN.Meanwhile, Moscow is keen to exploit a long-running territorial dispute in  Comoros, the documents say. France directly controls one out of four of the Indian Ocean islands, Mayotte. In 2018 Prigozhin employees flew to Comoros via Belarus. Their objective was to test if “political technologies” might be used to inflame the row between Paris and the Comoros government.A plan to revive “pan-African consciousness” appears closely modelled on the idea of Russkiy Mir, or Russian world. The concept has become fashionable under Putin and signifies Russian power and culture extended beyond current borders.One working paper is titled “African world”. It calls for a developing “African self-identity”. It recommends collecting a database of Africans living in the US and Europe, which might be used to groom “future leaders” and “agents of influence”. The eventual goal is a “loyal chain of representatives across African territory”, the March 2018 paper says.More immediate practical measures include setting up Russian-controlled non-governmental organisations in African states and organising local meetings. It is unclear how many Prigozhin initiatives have actually gone forward. There is evidence that media projects mentioned in the documents are now up and running – albeit with marginal impact. They include a website, Africa Daily Voice, with its HQ in Morocco, and a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama, based in Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo.Russian operatives also offer thoughts on global politics. One policy paper, titled “Russian influence in Africa”, says Moscow needs to find “reliable partners among African states” and should establish military bases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3ab135664ac154d09d9e8f3aeb9a160ae70716f/99_107_5838_3505/master/5838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=791fd976796ab02cdb0ca512a86ee002","title":"samoa bans elton john biopic rocketman over gay scenes","story":"Pacific nation’s censor says homosexual activity depicted on screen violates its lawsThe Pacific nation of Samoa has banned the Elton John biopic Rocketman because of its depictions of homosexuality.Samoa’s principal censor, Leiataua Niuapu Faaui, told the Samoa Observer on Tuesday that the homosexual activity depicted on screen violated laws and did not sit well with the country’s cultural and Christian beliefs.The censor did concede that “it’s a good story, in that it’s about an inidual trying to move on in life”.Apollo Cinemas Samoa wrote on Facebook it had to cancel Rocketman “due to censoring issues”.The movie, starring Taron Egerton, examines John’s sexuality and relationship with his former manager John Reid.A Russian distributor censored scenes from Rocketman that featured gay sex and drug use, and John wrote in a joint statement with the film-makers that it was a “sad reflection of the ided world we still live in and how it can still be so cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people”.Russian gay rights activists and prominent figures denounced the move.

Author and naturalist  Mark Cocker reveals what you should be looking out forAt this moment in the year, there are few landscapes in the country that give a more complete sense of life’s renewal than a British wood. You are instantly aware of how the harsh atmosphere that gripped the bare trees in winter has suddenly been burst asunder. Fresh greenery is all around and the sap in some trees can flow so vigorously that you can put your ear to the trunk and even hear it gurgling and crackling as it rises.While we may feel surrounded by new life, it is well to recall that we are also in the presence of something ancient. Most of our deciduous trees – which make up the bulk of the UK’s woodland – are seed-bearing varieties. Trees such as oaks, ash, hazel, beech, lime and birch have a heritage dating back 125m years.A fascinating feature of woods, which indicates the timescale in which they have evolved, is that if a young hazel or ash tree is cut down, the organism does not normally die. Instead, from the stump arises a fountain spray of new growth. The great scholar of landscape history Oliver Rackham judged that this reflex by trees was how they had evolved to cope with prehistoric elephant damage, when the animals once roamed through this country, plucking and eating branches.The elephants may have gone, but the trees are still reacting and our Neolithic ancestors learned to exploit this behaviour to make the woods work for them. The cutting process, known as “coppicing”, has been a part of British woodland management for thousands of years. It results in an abundance of pole-like branches that can be used as building materials or charcoal. Look out in many woods for the great thickets of hazel coppicing.The flowers that often carpet woodlands are at the heart of any spring visit, but their environment presents them with a challenge. When the leaves on the trees have fully emerged, the closed canopy traps everything underneath in heavy shadow. Woodland plants thus benefit from coppicing because it allows light to flood down, but the plants also flower before the tree leaves are out, making late April about the best time to enjoy them.In old, well-maintained woods the ground is sometimes smothered, first in snowdrops, then lesser celandines, primroses, dog-violets, wood anemones and wild garlic – whose name gives a clue to the strong reek that fills the air – and finally, and most famously, in bluebells. The latter can result in a continuous carpet of dark, smoky blue flowers rippling across the woodland floor.These, in turn, are a major attraction for the first bumblebee queens that are establishing new colonies, as well as early spring butterflies including brimstones and orange-tips. Bluebell woods, which are one of the most beautiful visions in all of nature, are found in almost every county from Cornwall to Caithness and are very much a speciality of these islands.Another feature in which British woods are better endowed than those of almost any other European country is very ancient trees. Often misshapen, with frequent amputations where their limbs have broken off in storms, these “veterans”, as they are known, are ecologically important. Standing deadwood, which can persist on the tree for decades, is a valuable habitat for many types of insect.Certain places have become famous for their veterans, including Burnham Beeches in Buckinghamshire. There are even older coppiced beech trees in Epping Forest, which may be as much as 1,000 years old.Best known of all perhaps is a tree with its own road directions – the Major Oak in Sherwood Forest. This monster, with its 10-metre waistband, is thought to be about 1,100 years old and receives 500,000 visitors a year.Ancient trees such as this one encourage us to ponder the cultural changes to which they have been witness. Yet all woods are subject to a natural, annual and cyclical process that makes almost every visit a completely different experience.In spring, the landscape may resound to the sounds of the birds. Flowers are in full bloom and the new leaf growth has a delicate soft shade of green. Yet come again in high summer and the atmosphere is warmer, but heavier and darker. The trees have largely fallen silent but for the perpetual drone of woodland insects.By autumn, the foliage is acquiring a new palette, while the ground has a sudden second explosion of colour because of the season’s mushrooms. When the canopy finally falls, there may be the melancholy drama of winter, but it too is set to the deliciously crunchy, upbeat music of all those leaves underfoot.The real joy of woods is that they are ever-changing. No single encounter can do justice to their complexity. No visit is the same as the last."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3921032.1560183165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"con o callaghan on the leaving i did well it was a very competitive school","story":"Con O’Callaghan (23) is an All-Ireland winning footballer for Dublin and dual player in football and hurling for local Cuala.

Carol Doyle, TUI representative and a business teacher at Avondale Community College in Rathdrum, Co Wicklow, said the paper allowed the strongest students to expand their answer and show their work, while the less adept student could provide responses to the questions too.Eamon Scully, ASTI representative and a teacher at Maria Immaculata Community School in Dunmanway, Cork, said there was enough on the paper for students who might struggle and for those with a flair for business. Both teachers agreed that the paper was topical. “There were questions on a proposed 15c tax on disposable coffee cups, which was tied in with environmental concerns,” said Ms Doyle. “Contactless payments also appeared as did Garda recruitment (in the context of overall State expenditure).”Critical thinkingMr Scully said that students who had listened to or read the news could do well, with corporation tax, online shopping and economic growth all covered. “Critical thinking is built in throughout the paper with, for instance, students having to think about the effects of unemployment,” he added. “But it remains accessible for students who may not be as strong at business.”Ms Doyle said that the paper was well-balanced and that the long questions included elements from the three different strands of the course: enterprise, our economy and personal finance.

This is the eighth year that Gnáthrud has not appeared in the prose section, however Dís was widely anticipated and students would have been well prepared for this,” she said.One surprise was the appearance of An tEarrach Thiar in the poetry section. “Having said that , the poem is regarded as one of the easiest of the five on the course, and the question was very straightforward” said Ms Grealy.MarkieviczThe first comprehension dealt with Constance Markievicz, her life and women obtaining the vote in 1918. “It was a dull comprehension, but would have been easily understood,” said Ms Grealy. “The second comprehension dealt with research and exploration in space. Students might have had difficulty with the translation of the word in the title ‘taiscéalaíocht’ which means exploration. “This would be a problem, as the word was mentioned consistently throughout the comprehension.”Students will have been happy with the questions on the play An Triail, which about 80 per cent opt for, she said.

Overall, towns and villages without a smoky coal ban have, on average, 20 per cent higher concentrations of microscopic particles than those with a ban.Earlier this year, Minister for the Environment Richard Bruton announced a delay to the long-awaited ban on bituminous – or “smoky” – coal. The nationwide ban would have been a long time coming, even if it went ahead this year. Smoky coal was banned in Dublin in 1990, with larger towns and villages around the country following suit in the years that followed. The total ban is a long-held goal for clean air campaigners. It was first announced by then-minister for the environment Alan Kelly in 2015. Prior to that, it had been signalled by his predecessor, Phil Hogan. When he held the office, Denis Naughten was on the verge of putting the ban in place before his ministerial career was derailed by the controversy surrounding the National Broadband Plan. Coal companies had been given a year to run down their supplies, and many had invested heavily in smokeless fuel plants, anticipating that the ban would come into place, as planned, before this winter.As previously reported by The , the EPA delivered its report on the impact smoky coal was having on air quality in rural towns and villages on April 1st. However, just one day later, Richard Bruton announced the delay, with the department facing legal threats from coal merchants. That report, which was released to The  following a request made under Access to Information on the Environment (AIE) legislation, reveals the widening gap between air quality in areas with and without a smoky coal ban. The results are stark.Highest concentrationsEnniscorthy, which began monitoring the level of a particulate called PM2.5 only in 2018, has the highest concentrations of this matter in the State. PM2.5 is a particle made of solids and liquids, and measures 2.5 microns in diameter (a micron is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a metre). According to the report, it is a better indicator of man-made particulate matter than the larger PM10, which is 10 microns in diameter. Previous research shows that PM2.5 is predominantly produced in Irish towns and cities by the burning of solid fuel. At the time the report was written, the Co Wexford town had exceeded a daily limit on the concentration of air pollutant more than anywhere else in the country, a total of nine times. Enniscorthy has similar fuel use patterns to the rest of the country, but its topography means that polluted air can hang over the town.The report shows that the level of PM2.5 in Enniscorthy was consistently above the air quality guidelines produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) during the 2018-2019 winter heating season. In Enniscorthy and other areas without a ban, the particulate level “can be upwards of double the concentrations observed at the monitoring site in Finglas, Dublin and in Bray, Wicklow”, both of which have bans in place.On average, concentrations of the particulate are 20 per cent higher in towns without a smoky coal ban than in Cork and Dublin, the two largest cities in the State. When compared to all towns with a smoky coal ban, average levels are 14 per cent higher. It is a similar story for PM10, the larger particulate. Enniscorthy has the highest average levels for this matter and, again, towns without smoky coal bans fare worse than the largest cities. City airOn average, concentrations of the matter are 6 per cent higher than towns with a ban, and 12 per cent higher than in Dublin and Cork. The large cities, counterintuitively, benefit from cleaner air because they have had the ban longer and have access to natural gas mains. Their large size also means people are unlikely to travel beyond their confines to purchase smoky coal, as can be the case in smaller towns and cities with a ban. The report’s conclusion is unequivocal: “Continuing emissions from domestic solid fuel use are contributing to high levels of particulate matter in villages, towns and cities. We are above the WHO air quality guideline value for PM2.5 at many locations at which we monitor. The proposed extension of the ban on smoky coal will have a positive impact on levels of particulate matter particularly in rural towns and villages.” However, the day after this report was given to the department, the ban was delayed. Critics say Government inaction will exacerbate this problem, and worsen health outcomes for those affected.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has defended his fiscal policies and rejected criticism from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) after it described the Government’s projections for the public finances as “not credible”. The fiscal watchdog found the Government had breached post-financial crisis spending rules last year, with budget increases leaving the State running the risk “of repeating the mistakes of the past”.The advisory council said the projections – laid out in the Stability Programme Update 2019 – show exchequer surpluses increasing each year based on expenditure forecasts that were not probable.“They imply an implausible slowdown in spending growth based on technical assumptions, which do not reflect either likely future policies or the future cost of meeting existing commitments,” Ifac said.Responding to the criticisms Mr Donohoe said there were always risks for a small, open economy.Construction“Yes, I acknowledge the risk and there was too much reliance in the past on one sector – construction. Now there are 2.16million working in our economy not relevant to the construction sector.”Careful management of the economy had resulted in 0.2 per cent surplus this year, he said. But there are “constant demands for increases in expenditure.”The challenge now will be how he “pulls this together in the face of constant demands.”He said while he values the contribution of people in the Defence Forces, there is a collective pay agreement and “despite what Fianna Fáil says about being careful they are going into the Dáil this evening looking for money.”The Public Service Pay Commission would deal with the issue shortly, he added.“Fianna Fáil decided to take advantage of that. We will stick to the collective agreement that treats all public servants equally.”In relation to the Local Property Tax he said he wants to ensure that most people will pay the same and that those who will have to pay more will find it affordable."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeBoris and Gove: the best of frenemiesComic Relief will stop sending celebrities abroad in wake of \u0026#39white saviour\u0026#39 racism row, Richard Curtis tells MPs  RSPCA criticises music festival after camel appears in fancy dress Comment: Our next PM must urgently move the Brexit debate forward, or risk being crushed by no deal Tory leadership race latest: Suspending Parliament to allow a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit is not illegal, Geoffrey Cox tells the CabinetRyanair to launch new Malta-based airlineOxfam put children\u0026#39s safety at risk by ignoring warning signs over Haiti sex abuse scandal, report findsFrench parents sue government to make it disclose nappy brands containing toxic chemicalsLorraine Kelly v Esther McVey: Former TV colleagues explain awkward moment on Good Morning BritainConservative leadership contenders: Who are the Tory candidates hoping to become the next Prime Minister?Seven drown after migrant boat overturns off Greek island of Lesbos in deadliest incident this yearUK weather: Railway lines submerged by flood water as June on track to be wettest on record Comment: Tory Thatcherites should be terrified by the rise of cunning Rory StewartWhy Amber Rudd is wrong when she says Brussels respects Jeremy HuntFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFour bodies found as salvage crews lift capsized Hungarian tourist boatComment: Britain is being dangerously complacent about the return of HizbollahSingaporean er survives 80 hours adrift at seaComment: The next PM must address the disturbing impact of social media on the vulnerable youngWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

gardeners world presenting team good thing even less","story":"The Gardeners\u0026#39 World presenting team, pictured in 2018Carol Klein, the BBC Gardeners’ World presenter, has said she is happy to have less airtime to make way for black and disabled colleagues.The programme has been revamped in recent years to make the presenting team more erse. A consequence is that some veterans of the show, including Klein, have less to do.“Monty Don is still the kingpin, but they wanted to change the format, partly to be more inclusive: to have someone in a wheelchair, someone who’s black,” Klein explained.“That’s happened across lots of TV and I don’t resent it at all. I think it’s a good thing,” she told Radio Times.Flo Headlam, a former charity worker who took up gardening professionally in 2012, became the programme’s first black presenter in 2017 and has said: “The response has been very positive. Obviously I’m a black woman and they’ve never had a black woman on the programme before, so it’s a breath of fresh air.”Mark Lane, an award-winning garden designer, is the first disabled presenter on Gardeners’ World. He was diagnosed with spina bifida in his 30s after struggling for years with back pain, and began using a wheelchair after a car accident left him requiring more spinal surgery.He has said: “I feel very proud of my achievements and love the fact that most of the time new clients don’t even know that I am in a wheelchair. That means I am being judged on my work, rather than on who I am.“I love meeting people - whether they’re gardeners or community groups - and I love visiting gardens that I may never have got around to seeing. I also think it’s great that someone with a disability is now showing others that gardening can be done.”“Hopefully, iniduals like myself can show broadcasters that disabled people can do a lot of things, rather than just being a token gesture.”Carol Klein is one of the show\u0026#39s longest-serving presentersA BBC spokesman said: “The Gardeners’ World presenters and experts are all chosen for their horticultural knowledge, and we are proud to have such a erse mix of talent on the programme.”Klein, asked for the secret to her longevity, replied: “I think they just don’t dare give me the sack! I’m 73 and I’ve been doing gardening TV for going on 25 years so I was quite old when I came into it.”She is also presenting two shows on Channel 5, Great British Gardens and The Great Garden Challenge.A decade ago, her future on Gardeners’ World appeared to be in doubt when she was passed over for the lead presenter role in favour of Toby Buckland, despite having more experience on the show. Fans complained, accusing the BBC of sexism.She said at the time: “Many viewers assumed that I’d turned down the job but in fact I was never offered it. Had I been asked, I would have loved to have done it and I think I could have done it very well, but I was never in a position to say yes or no. It looks like I’ve hit what you might call the ‘grass ceiling’.”Boris and Gove: the best of frenemiesComic Relief will stop sending celebrities abroad in wake of \u0026#39white saviour\u0026#39 racism row, Richard Curtis tells MPs  RSPCA criticises music festival after camel appears in fancy dress Comment: Our next PM must urgently move the Brexit debate forward, or risk being crushed by no deal Tory leadership race latest: Suspending Parliament to allow a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit is not illegal, Geoffrey Cox tells the CabinetRyanair to launch new Malta-based airlineOxfam put children\u0026#39s safety at risk by ignoring warning signs over Haiti sex abuse scandal, report findsFrench parents sue government to make it disclose nappy brands containing toxic chemicalsLorraine Kelly v Esther McVey: Former TV colleagues explain awkward moment on Good Morning BritainConservative leadership contenders: Who are the Tory candidates hoping to become the next Prime Minister?Seven drown after migrant boat overturns off Greek island of Lesbos in deadliest incident this yearUK weather: Railway lines submerged by flood water as June on track to be wettest on record Comment: Tory Thatcherites should be terrified by the rise of cunning Rory StewartWhy Amber Rudd is wrong when she says Brussels respects Jeremy HuntFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFour bodies found as salvage crews lift capsized Hungarian tourist boatComment: Britain is being dangerously complacent about the return of HizbollahSingaporean er survives 80 hours adrift at seaComment: The next PM must address the disturbing impact of social media on the vulnerable youngWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000002419071_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"french parents sue government make disclose nappy brands containing","story":"Parents’ groups are suing the French government in a bid to force it to name brands of babies’ nappies that contain dangerous chemicals.France’s national health agency, Anses, said in January that it had found traces of potentially toxic chemicals in disposable babies’ nappies that exceeded safety limits, but the brands concerned have never been named by the authorities.Parents and the Child Health Association campaign group filed a joint lawsuit on Tuesday before France’s highest court, the Council of State.They said they had written to the Health Ministry two months ago, asking for the names of the brands concerned, but never received a response.Quentin Guillemain, a parent involved in the action, said: “We’re also asking for the withdrawal of dangerous nappies and better information for parents. This is a health emergency.” Tests detected the presence of substances such as hydrocarbons, dioxins and perfumes at levels potentially dangerous to health. The controversial weedkiller glyphosate was also found, but in smaller quantities. The government ordered manufacturers to take measures to eliminate the substances or reduce them as much as possible.Approximate time taken for common materials to decomposeSome of the chemicals were added intentionally but others are believed to have been introduced from contaminated materials during the manufacturing process.A lawyer acting for the parents, Corinne Lepage, who served as environment minister in the conservative government of President Jacques Chirac, criticised the authorities’ lack of transparency: “Parents aren’t sure of the products they are buying. This is not normal.”Loïc Tanguy, an official in the government’s consumer protection department, said the authorities were reluctant to name brands because the health agency had not analysed all of them and the tests, which were carried out two years ago, may no longer be valid.“Blaming one brand will make people think that another is better, when it may be that the other one has not been analysed,” he said.Mr Tanguy said new tests had been started and a list of brands found to contain dangerous chemicals would be made public by the end of the year.In January, the health agency, Anses, called for rapid action in view of the potential danger to infants but Agnès Buzyn, the health minister, said there was “no serious or immediate risk” and parents could continue using disposable nappies. Boris and Gove: the best of frenemiesComic Relief will stop sending celebrities abroad in wake of \u0026#39white saviour\u0026#39 racism row, Richard Curtis tells MPs  RSPCA criticises music festival after camel appears in fancy dress Comment: Our next PM must urgently move the Brexit debate forward, or risk being crushed by no deal Tory leadership race latest: Suspending Parliament to allow a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit is not illegal, Geoffrey Cox tells the CabinetRyanair to launch new Malta-based airlineOxfam put children\u0026#39s safety at risk by ignoring warning signs over Haiti sex abuse scandal, report findsLorraine Kelly v Esther McVey: Former TV colleagues explain awkward moment on Good Morning BritainConservative leadership contenders: Who are the Tory candidates hoping to become the next Prime Minister?Seven drown after migrant boat overturns off Greek island of Lesbos in deadliest incident this yearUK weather: Railway lines submerged by flood water as June on track to be wettest on record Comment: Tory Thatcherites should be terrified by the rise of cunning Rory StewartWhy Amber Rudd is wrong when she says Brussels respects Jeremy HuntFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFour bodies found as salvage crews lift capsized Hungarian tourist boatComment: Britain is being dangerously complacent about the return of HizbollahSingaporean er survives 80 hours adrift at seaComment: The next PM must address the disturbing impact of social media on the vulnerable youngJeremy Hunt refuses Foreign Office support for Nicola Sturgeon Brussels visit \u0026#39to talk up independence\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11 june 2019","story":"UK weather -

including camels - having to appear at a festival.“The large crowds of partying people and loud music at such an event, as well as the transport there and back, is likely to be very stressful for the animal. We question the necessity of taking a camel to an event like this. ” They added that “animals such as camels are naturally social, so being exhibited alone, without a suitable companion animal, would compound the stress.” Festival-goers who witnessed organisers dragging the camel around said it was “modern-day animal cruelty” with the animal forced to endure music blasted from tents. Attendee, Sophie Wilkinson, uploaded a photo of the animal on Instagram with the caption: “Why did Rox Promotions think it was acceptable to bring a camel into their Land Beyond festival? Owners were seen abusing the animal and it was visibly distressed by the noisedrunk people.” Further pictures and videos of the animal have circulated online with social media users outraged by the festival’s decision. Do they really think that today’s youth want to see an animal in clear distress? One festival-goer told student newspaper The Tab. Adding to the mounting criticism a post by Leah Ingham who questioned the owners at the festival on Vegan Brighton has seen over 100 comments. Lucy Norman said: “I was working on the bar at the festival and was shocked when I saw it!! Couldn\u0027t believe my eyes.” Kyna Walker, who was also at the event, added: “I\u0027m glad you said something to them or tried to ask questions as to why! I went to do the same. But was in disbelief and a bit too annoyed about it to put anything across or know what to say. “Very unnecessary for a camel or any animal to be at a festival and especially it being a rowdy drum and bass one. Very sad” Land Beyond and the company who provided the camel maintain the animal was well looked after.The festival was called off on Saturday due to high winds but went ahead on Sunday 9 June with Dizzee Rascal headlining the event.Boris and Gove: the best of frenemiesComic Relief will stop sending celebrities abroad in wake of \u0026#39white saviour\u0026#39 racism row, Richard Curtis tells MPs  Comment: Our next PM must urgently move the Brexit debate forward, or risk being crushed by no deal Tory leadership race latest: Suspending Parliament to allow a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit is not illegal, Geoffrey Cox tells the CabinetRyanair to launch new Malta-based airlineOxfam put children\u0026#39s safety at risk by ignoring warning signs over Haiti sex abuse scandal, report findsFrench parents sue government to make it disclose nappy brands containing toxic chemicalsLorraine Kelly v Esther McVey: Former TV colleagues explain awkward moment on Good Morning BritainConservative leadership contenders: Who are the Tory candidates hoping to become the next Prime Minister?Seven drown after migrant boat overturns off Greek island of Lesbos in deadliest incident this yearUK weather: Railway lines submerged by flood water as June on track to be wettest on record Comment: Tory Thatcherites should be terrified by the rise of cunning Rory StewartWhy Amber Rudd is wrong when she says Brussels respects Jeremy HuntFind out which Conservative leadership candidate is right for you with this quickfire quizFour bodies found as salvage crews lift capsized Hungarian tourist boatComment: Britain is being dangerously complacent about the return of HizbollahSingaporean er survives 80 hours adrift at seaComment: The next PM must address the disturbing impact of social media on the vulnerable youngComment: The Tories aren\u0026#39t ready for someone as downright Machiavellian as Michael Gove to be leaderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/17/11/dwp.jpg","title":"uk jobs data myths misinformation employment figures richard clegg","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

When a recent UK Statistics Authority survey asked a representative sample of the public, 85 per cent\u0026nbspof people who expressed a view said they trusted the statistics produced by the ONS. Moreover, nearly three in four agreed they were produced without any political interference.\u0026nbspThis doesn’t stop some people on Twitter from expressing the view that our labour market figures are misleading or manipulated to support the government of the day.Here are some the most common misapprehensions I’ve spent a lot of time rebutting, in the hope we can persuade anyone who remains undecided on the veracity of our statistics to join the majority who trust our data.\u0026nbsp“The jobs figures are rigged by the government”\u0026nbspThe main numbers do not come from government data on jobs or benefits. Instead, they all come directly from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a very large household survey carried out by the ONS right across the UK. That’s us, talking directly to real people in their tens of thousands, and logging information about their own experiences. I should also take this opportunity to say thank you to the thousands of people who take time to respond to our survey.\u0026nbspWe ask, among many other things, whether they are working, seeking work or not active in the labour market at all – in other words, we’re measuring their actual labour market behaviour.Ministers and their advisers have no influence on the ONS employment figures and no longer see the figures before they become public. We are independent of ministerial control and accountable, through the UK Statistics Authority, to parliament rather than the government.\u0026nbspThe claimant count is derived from benefits data provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). But\u0026nbspit’s compiled by ONS statisticians operating under a strict code of professional impartiality. It also ceased long ago to be part of the headline employment indicators –\u0026nbspthose are all drawn from the ONS survey.“Employment growth is driven by people working an hour a week or\u0026nbspon zero-hours contracts”Only a very small proportion of people in employment work very few hours – in January to March 2019 only 1.4 per cent of workers usually worked six hours a week or less. For many years this proportion has been falling, not rising, so is not a new thing. Likewise, only about 2.6 per cent of workers are in a zero-hours contract in their main job, and this proportion appears now to have peaked or to be falling.\u0026nbspYes, someone who only works for an hour a week is technically defined as employed because that’s the standard international definition of employment (more on that below). But the numbers of such people would seem to be vanishingly small.\u0026nbsp“The definition of employment and unemployment has been changed by the government to massage the figures so our figures aren’t comparable with those for other countries”The definitions used in the figures – what counts as employment and what as unemployment – are agreed internationally at the forum of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The reason for this is, of course, precisely to ensure that different countries’ figures are comparable. These definitions are long-standing and haven’t been altered. Because they are set internationally, they are not subject to alteration by the UK government and there have been no changes at all to these definitions since the change of government in 2010.“The latest figures are not on the same basis as figures for the 1970s”Our employment and unemployment statistics go back to 1971 and we use the same ILO definitions throughout, so it is not true to say that our latest figures are not comparable with those for the 1970s. Our figures for the 1970s and 1980s are not the same as when those figures were originally published.Unemployment down again but Britain has a soft financial underbellyHow is UK unemployment so low despite Brexit turmoil?Universal basic income trial fails to help people back into workEmployers must do more to tackle domestic abuseEmployers not doing enough to keep new and expectant mothers safe That is because unemployment statistics used to be based on the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits. However, we have used ILO definitions as our main indicator for over 20 years now because the previous method did not follow international standards and bred scepticism about the independence of the figures. Our unemployment figures have been based solely on the Labour Force Survey\u0026nbspsince the spring of 1992 when we started doing that survey on a continuous basis. The figures from 1971 up until the spring of 1992 are based on other surveys and indicators but use the same ILO definitions as the figures from spring 1992 onwards.“ONS includes unpaid family carers in the employment figures”This is an understandable mistake, but a mistake all the same. There is a small sub-category of employed people called “unpaid family workers” (though it only amounts to 131,000 people compared with 27.6 million employees and 4.9 million self-employed). That’s less than 0.5\u0026nbspper cent of all people in employment. However, it does not cover unpaid carers, who would not count in our employment figures if their caring responsibilities prevented them from being available for work. “Unpaid family workers” are actually people who work in a family business without receiving a formal wage or salary but benefit\u0026nbspfrom its profits instead.“Unemployment is a count of benefit claimants, and so ‘sanctioned’\u0026nbspclaimants and those not claiming benefits are excluded from the figures”That’s not the case at all – as I said, the unemployment figure comes from the ONS survey\u0026nbspnot the DWP, which manages the benefits system. The people who are counted as unemployed are those\u0026nbspaged 16 or over who are not working but are\u0026nbspboth looking for and are available for work, no matter what benefits they may or may not be receiving. So having one’s benefit claim sanctioned (stopped or reduced) does not directly affect this at all.“The school leaving age has been raised to 18, so 16- and 17-year-olds have been removed from the unemployment figures”The ONS does in fact measure unemployment among this age group. Our published figures show that in January to March 2019, there were 81,000 unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds, of whom 61,000 were still in full-time education. Of course, it is perfectly possible still to be in full-time education and count as unemployed – a student who was actively looking for a part-time job would meet the ILO definition and so would count in our numbers. Nor is it correct to say that the school leaving age has been raised to 18: while 17- to 18-year-olds are required to undertake some form of education or training, there is no requirement for them to remain at school. People in that age group can enter the labour market and some choose to do so.These, then, are the main misconceptions I’ve had to deal with. I suppose it’s understandable and only human to doubt figures when they don’t match your own experience. In addition, our statistics cannot capture every aspect of the labour market that is important to people. We’ve also been reporting record high employment levels at a time when according to other ONS figures the economy has not exactly been booming for everyone. Wage growth also has by historical standards been quite slow\u0026nbspand, adjusting for inflation, wages remain below their 2008 levels.\u0026nbspThe ONS survey is probably the biggest regular, long-running household survey in the UK. Its findings aren’t precise – there’s a degree of uncertainty in any sample survey, of course. But the ONS operates transparently and in the public interest. If anyone wants to know more about how the figures are compiled or what they say, we’re always happy to explain.\u0026nbspRichard Clegg is an employment statistician at the Office for National Statistics.\u0026nbspAfter 15 years as senior statistician presenting the UK’s monthly\u0026nbspemployment figures, he\u0026nbspis retiring from the ONSOffice for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company hopes that they and many more to be launched in the future will power fast internet connections that will enable people around the world to get online.SpaceX had said that the objects would be bareful visible at all.But as soon as that launch was complete, people spotted the mysterious shiny objects flying through the night sky, as bright as the stars. Some even reported UFO sightings, fearful of what they thought they were seeing.Now the American Astronomical Society has together warned the world that the satellites could pose a considerable risk to people on the ground and in the sky. Such constellations could eventually outnumbers the number of visible stars in the sky, the astronomers said, with tens of thousands of the objects planned to be launched.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

The light being sent from the satellites as well as bouncing off them could stop astronomers seeing light from space, and the radiation coming out of them could get in the way of radio emissions.SpaceX launches first 60 satellites of its planned \u0027Starlink\u0027 projectWhat\u0027s more, the satellites are at risk of smashing into space-based observatories, which could cause chaos in near-Earth orbit.The group shared an image that showed how the trails formed by the satellites could ruin photos as they flew past.The society said it was excited by the possibility of new ways of connecting the world, and that it recognise that space was an increasingly important resource. But the world needs to do more to ensure that those using it don\u0027t pollute the night sky and harm astronomers and the general public.“The American Astronomical Society notes with concern the impending deployment of very large constellations of satellites into Earth orbit, it said in a new statement adopted during its most recent\u0026nbspmeeting.\u0026nbspThe number of such satellites is projected to grow into the tens of thousands over the next several years, creating the potential for substantial adverse impacts to ground- and space-based astronomy. These impacts could include significant disruption of optical and near-infrared observations by direct detection of satellites in reflected and emitted light contamination of radio astronomical observations by electromagnetic radiation in satellite communication bands and collision with space-based observatories.“The AAS recognizes that outer space is an increasingly available resource with many possible uses. However, the potential for multiple large satellite constellations to adversely affect both each other and the study of the cosmos is becoming increasingly apparent, both in low Earth orbit and beyond.“The AAS is actively working to assess the impacts on astronomy of large satellite constellations before their numbers rise further. Only with thorough and quantitative understanding can we properly assess the risks and identify appropriate mitigating actions.

They\u0026nbspare more likely to have a dependent family, fewer savings and may be able to access services because of minimum age limits or distances.I stay in a care home which is in Horsham near where our home is,” Mr Hoskins said. “But we just hope we can keep our home because finances now are a lot tighter.”Penny regualrly cares for him and the family have sacrificed luxuries like a TV subscription\u0026nbspPaul used to have to follow the cricket.Exercise and eat better but ‘bin the supplements’ to avoid dementiaNew form of dementia identified, leading to hope for a cureNHS to sell patients genetic tests showing risk of killer diseasesPaul can remember what happened to him over the past few weeks, as well as big life events like renewing his vows with Penny, but he said he can lose his train of thought and has\u0026nbspmedication to regulate his moods which means he couldn\u0027t work or drive.Some of his care funding goes towards taxis to attend\u0026nbspweekly clubs where people with dementia\u0026nbspcan play table tennis, badminton or do some gardening.But he said these can\u0026nbspbe\u0026nbspfrustrating because he is\u0026nbspoften the youngest person attending them and most of his fellow participants were less physically able than him.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHoskins teamed up with actress Suranne Jones, whose mother had dementia, to raise awareness of the Alzheimer\u0027s Society\u0027s cupcake day (Alzheimer\u0026amp#039s Society)“I don’t think there’s enough understanding of younger dementia, or funding,” Mr Hoskins said.

I’ve got to see my family, they’re the critical part of my life.”He recently teamed up with Dr Foster actress Suranne Jones, whose mother had early onset vascular dementia, to promote the Alzheimer’s Society’s Cupcake Day on Thursday 13 June.The fundraising campaign highlights that dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK and six people will be diagnosed in the time it takes to bake a batch of cakes.The family trying to change the ‘tragedy narrative’ around Alzheimer’sThe charity has been lobbying to raise awareness of the needs of young dementia sufferers among doctors and politicians.Paul said\u0026nbspfunding research into these early forms of dementia is key as there is currently\u0026nbspno\u0026nbsptreatment which can slow or cure the disease.To encourage this, he said he gives\u0026nbsptalks to aspiring medical students about his condition in the hope of inspiring the next generation of researchers.“Eventually I will have loss of speech, then you get loss of swallowing, my mobility will be far worse,” he said.\u0026nbsp“But I don’t necessarily want to think about it, I’d rather get on and keep going”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But that is just one theory on where it may have come from, and scientists stress that it is still unknown what the material is and where it might have come from.Imagine taking a pile of metal five times larger than the Big Island of Hawaii and burying it underground. That\u0027s roughly how much unexpected mass we detected, said Peter B James,\u0026nbspassistant professor of planetary geophysics in Baylor\u0027s College of Arts \u0026amp Sciences and lead author on a new study of the huge chunk.The crater that the mass sits under\u0026nbspis oval-shaped and 2,000 kilometers wide.

One of the explanations of this extra mass is that the metal from the asteroid that formed this crater is still embedded in the Moon\u0027s mantle.Scientists simulated a possible collision with an asteroid on a computer, and found that some kinds of metal could settle into the layer between the crust and the core, where this chunk is still sitting.We did the math and showed that a sufficiently dispersed core of the asteroid that made the impact could remain suspended in the Moon\u0027s mantle until the present day, rather than sinking to the Moon\u0027s core, Professor James said in a statement.If it is an asteroid impact, then it could be an unprecedented look at the kinds of collisions that were happening four billion years ago, when the crater was formed. Bigger impacts are thought to have happened through history – even on Earth – but they have been lost with time, and so the crater could be a way of looking back at a process that shaped our own planet and those that surround us.But the mass might also have formed with the Moon itself. It might be a build-up of dense gas that came about when the Moon formed into the large solid mass that we know today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe. It is the EU that keeps peace in Europe, because when you trade, you do not fight.Created with Sketch.D-Day 75: Normandy landings in pictures Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

That is known.”The spokesperson added that Brussels\u0026nbspwas on a “Brexit break” and that it would also\u0026nbsp”refrain from any positions or opinions that would risk interfering with the ongoing leadership contest in the Conservative party”.What would happen if the UK decided not to pay the Brexit orce billBack in Westminster, Mr Johnson had claimed he could withhold payment of the Brexit orce bill in order to force the EU\u0027s hand and change the deal. Michael Gove has said he would bring a full stop to the controversial Irish backstop plan, while Jeremy Hunt and\u0026nbspSajid Javid\u0026nbsphave also said they would renegotiate it.\u0026nbspMeanwhile Matt Hancock as said he would push for a time-limit on the policy, which the EU has also ruled out. Mark Harper has said he would replace the withdrawal agreement with the so-called Malthouse compromise, a plan cooked-up by Tory MPs that was met with derision in Brussels when it was first unveiled months ago.The leadership contenders were accused of humiliating the UK with their approach. Chris Davies, a newly elected Liberal Democrat MEP said: The Tory leadership race has become a unicorn hunt, in which the riders are totally detached from the reality of what our European partners are actually saying to us.\u0026nbspNone of the candidates to be our future PM have learnt anything from the Article 50 negotiations. Brexit has to stop.\u0026nbsp The humiliation of our country must cease.

Such changes could include a customs union, or single market alignment.The current European Commission will be replaced in November by a new administration picked by members states, because it has reached the end of its term. But there are few major differences in Brussels over the handling of Brexit, and all the prospective candidates to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as president have similar views on the withdrawal agreement. In fact, one possible contender for the top job is Michel Barnier himself – the EU\u0027s chief Brexit\u0026nbspnegotiator.\u0026nbspWhile the Commission conducted day-to-day negotiations with the UK on the treaty, its objectives and policies were set by the 27 remaining EU national leaders on the European Council, further illustrating that a change in Commission is unlikely to change the maths on Brexit.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As the overwhelming favourite among the party membership, Boris Johnson is relying on his charisma to walk his way to the highest position in government. While there is a growing Stop Boris collective of Tory MPs, many in the party believe that he is the only candidate who could win a general election. He insists that Britain must leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first cabinet member to announce his bid just hours after the Prime Minister declared her departure date. He supported the Prime Minister\u0027s deal when she tried to get it through parliament and is pitching himself as the candidate to unite the Tory party.Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the house of commons, is pitching herself as the party unity candidate. Speaking to Sky News as she announced her bid, Leadsom claimed to be a decisive and compassionate leader. She will prepare to leave without a deal but claims to have a three-point plan for Brexit which she will set out later in the race. Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead. His greatest challenge may prove to be convincing MPs and members to trust him as he earned a bad reputation for standing against Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest after starting the race as Johnson\u0027s campaign manager.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is the most direct opposition to frontrunner Boris Johnson similarly inclined to a hard Brexit but not as controversial among Tory MPs. He would seek a new, fairer deal, though he insists that Britain must leave the EU by October 31. Raab announced his bid on Sunday 26 May, 2 days after the Prime Minister announced her departure date.Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, is somewhat of an outsider, he only joined the cabinet for the first time at the beginning of May. He is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, drawing on his unique diplomatic experience and pledging to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He has caught attention on social media for his campaigning approachEsther Mcvey, the former work and pensions secretary, is standing on a hard Brexit promise. She suggests that the EU ought to approach Britain with a better deal and pledges to step-up preparations for a no-deal Brexit.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, intends to stand for unity in a United Kingdom. He pledges to restore trust in politics by delivering Brexit. He has served in two cabinet positions in May\u0027s government, first as housing secretary before replacing Amber Rudd as home secretary, a role in which he garnered controversy over his declaration of a major incident when around 40 migrants attempted to cross the channel in small boats.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, aims to be a fresh leader for the future after delivering Brexit. He has said that he will be the servant of parliament in delivering Brexit. Mark Harper, the former chief whip, acknowledges that he is the underdog in this race. He claims to be a truly fresh face, compared with other candidates who have served in the cabinet. He has suggested that a further delay to Brexit may be necessary if the new prime minister is to negotiate a new deal.Sam Gyimah, a former universities minister, is the only candidate promising a second referendum. Announcing his bid on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Gyimah said We face a very stark and unwelcome choice. It is either no deal or revoke, via a second referendum, possibly.

Announcing his bid on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Gyimah said We face a very stark and unwelcome choice. It is either no deal or revoke, via a second referendum, possibly. With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Announcing his bid on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Gyimah said We face a very stark and unwelcome choice. It is either no deal or revoke, via a second referendum, possibly. Mr Harper said it was “not credible” for candidates such as Mr Johnson to suggest that they could renegotiate Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement by 31 October or to persuade MPs to accept it unchanged by that time.Declaring that it was “not going to be possible to leave by 31 October”, he said he would be ready to extend negotiations as late as May 2020, when local elections are due in the UK .His preference was for EU withdrawal with an agreement, but no-deal had to remain on the table and he wasprepared and comfortable to go through with it if necessary.Mr Harper, who was not appointed to a ministerial post under Theresa May, said he could offer a “fresh” approach to Brexit.Everyone else in this race has at some point in the last three years been sat around the cabinet table and has participated in the decisions that have led to us not leaving the EU three years after the referendum,” he said.“Every single one of them has participated in the fundamental misjudgments that have got us to where we are.As constitutional reform minister, Mr Harper was one of the authors of the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of 2011 which set out the 14-day window to find an alternative government following a confidence vote. He said it had been decided not to set out “prescriptive” rules on who should be invited to try to form an administration.Tory MPs contemplating a no-confidence vote to remove a no-deal PM “wouldn’t know what was going to happen”, he said.“It would be perfectly possible that if people voted against a confidence motion they could end up with Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister without a general election,” he said.Boris Johnson’s biggest problem isn’t the Tory leadership raceTheresa May and Brexit are influencing children’s creativityWhat would happen if the UK decided not to pay the Brexit orce billJeremy Hunt warns Tories will be \u0027annihilated\u0027 in early election“We would then go into a general election with Jeremy Corbyn already being prime minister and the Labour Party in government.”Given the threat of a Corbyn government and given the fact that voters had punished Tories at the European elections for failing to deliver Brexit, he said he believed that a majority of MPs would be ready to vote for no-deal “if they are faced with a government that’s busted a gut and done everything humanly possible to get a deal but just hasn’t been able to get one that can get through parliament”.But he added: “It would be a very narrow landing zone and you are not going to get there without a great deal of caution… This is going to have to be done carefully and cautiously with colleagues, and I don’t think you are going to be able to do it by blundering around like a bull in a china shop.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or she could leave. A police officer was eventually sought to deal with Ms Daugereaux with pool workers claiming that the mother used inappropriate language towards staff.Police body camera footage of the incident shows a tearful Ms Daugereaux saying she does not understand what she has done wrong.I\u0027m not being disrespectful, I don\u0027t want to cause a scene, Ms Daugereaux said.

The Mayor should scrap this £K event and use the money instead to keep Newham residents safe.This absurd situation would be funnyit wasn’t such a shocking indictment of this Mayor’s skewed priorities. People will rightly question why Khan is prioritising paddling pools over the safety of vulnerable Londoners.The Mayor has repeatedly said he cant spent more cash on police and fighting crime as his central budgets have been cut too much.Last years pop-up party featured street food stalls and classic film screenings too.The final bill came to an eye-watering £,, we revealed last year.The money for the beach project came from the London Economic Action Partnership - which works under the Mayors office.The cash for the project was from business rates generated in the local area. , Londoners flocked to the beach to enjoy a -metre swimming lido, a sun deck, street food stalls and musical entertainment - all for free.A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: The Royal Docks is set to become a major new district for London with up to , jobs and , new affordable homes. It is set to attract more than £ billion of investment by  .This summer we will be launching the Join The Docks festival with a range of activities for the local community, including a new Kids Summer Splash event.This community festival is funded entirely from local business rates, which must be used for the regeneration of the Royal Docks. It is a small but crucial part of the wider £. million investment programme and is key to supporting the local community in the Royal Docks."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn opinion brits love country","story":"The nation was remembering a debt that can never be repaid to the generation who bought our freedom with their youth, their blood and their lives.And Labour’s leader was ranting bug-eyed at a rally where many were seemingly convinced that the American president is a “Nazi”.No — Nazis built factories for the industrial slaughter of six million men, women and children. Nazis enslaved Europe until a generation gave their all to wipe that evil creed from the earth. Nazis — real Nazis! — were waiting for those men and boys when they landed on those hellish beaches  years ago.As our Queen welcomed the democratically elected leader of the country that fought by our side in Normandy, Corbyn made a great show of boycotting Trump’s state banquet but attending the anti-Trump protest.And Corbyn never looked more like a -year-old student. The Americans are not simply our oldest allies, Jeremy, the Americans are our biggest trading partners. Who are we going to trade withyou ever get to  Downing Street  Venezuela  Palestine Jeremy Corbyn made a massive misjudgement by so flamboyantly snubbing Trump. And I suspect that somewhere in his mediocre old mind, Jezza knows it. That is why he later begged Trump for a meeting, which the President took great delight in denying.The Queen showed Corbyn how it should be done. Whatever Her Majesty’s personal feelings about this brash American President — and she seems to quite like him — she welcomed Trump with grace and dignity.The Queen’s treatment of her American guest was not simply good diplomacy. It was good manners. And the British care about good manners. To insult the American President as we honoured the American boys who never went home was, more than anything, just so unforgivably RUDE. Does Jeremy Corbyn know nothing of the British people Millions find it mind-boggling that he can happily break bread with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but refuses to share a state dinner with the President of the United States.Corbyn has spent so long in the self-loathing sewer of the hard Left that he has lost sight of a simple truth — most British people have a deep and profound love for this country.This week was a reminder that we have so much to be proud of. A nation looked at that dwindling band of brothers who stormed the beaches of Normandy and felt nothing but gratitude for their sacrice.There is an instinctive patriotism in our people that Corbyn and his Marxist muppets simply do not understand or share. Labour may have clung on to their seat in Peterborough by the skin of Corbyn’s dentures, but the virtue-signalling old booby never looked less like a potential Prime Minister.The oldest student in town does not look ready to form a government. He looks ready for a care home. The compulsive halo-polishing goes down a storm on social media, Mr Corbyn. It just doesn’t work in the real world.If the day ever comes when Corbyn is drooling on the doorstep of  Downing Street, is he only going to do business with people he approves of  How lonely he will be!GEORGE MICHAEL was the most generous of men. When we wrote his autobiography together, we innocently shook hands on splitting the profits -. But a ghost writer does not usually get the same payday as the global superstar with his name on the front cover.When we wrote our book, George was coming off the back of his first solo album, Faith, and was possibly the biggest star in the world. His American managers confidently assured my agent that our - deal was never going to happen. But it did – because George Michael insisted on it.He had given his word and we had shaken hands. George didn’t care about money. He cared about friendship.  So it was interesting to see how George’s last will and testimony ided his £.million fortune.Among those included are George’s -year-old dad, Kyriacos, his sisters Melanie and Yioda, and his friends Shirlie Kemp and David Austin. Those who didn’t make the cut included his lovers Kenny Goss and Fadi Fawaz, and his old Wham! buddy, Andrew Ridgeley.But Kenny and Fadi enjoyed the good le at George’s side for many years while Andrew has a joint songwriting credit on Careless Whisper, which has been worth around £million in royalties. Not bad, as Andrew was never particularly known for his songwriting genius.George probably felt he had taken good care of Kenny, Fadi and Andrew in le. George could be stubborn, self-destructive and self-obsessed. But he was a beautul man. And he had the biggest heart in the world.THEY are all queuing up to kick Anthony Joshua while he is down. Tyson Fury initially made sympathetic noises when Joshua got battered on his American debut by roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr, a - underdog who resembles Homer Simpson’s body double.But now the Gypsy King has joined the sadistic joy in Joshua’s humiliation and recommends AJ, “never shows his face in public again”. Madison Square Garden was a catastrophe for Joshua.He was beaten up by a chubby chops who was such a late booking that his name did not even appear on the tickets.  But Ruiz was always more than a Snickers addict. Before Joshua, he had fought  times and only lost once. Ruiz was never going to be a walkover for Joshua.But AJ should have found a way to beat him. And such is the brutal nature of boxing that Joshua now needs to win a rematch with Ruiz Jrhe is to salvage his career.Joshua seemed strangely off in New York, distracted and uncertain, absent-mindedly pushing out his gum shield during the ring walk, weirdly smiley after the ref waved off the fight.  But Joshua has been a great advertisement for British boxing.And there is no shame in losing a boxing match. Muhammad Ali lost five times. Floyd Mayweather never lost. Now you tell me – who is the greater man SIOBAHN PRIGENT is the woman seen screaming “Nazi scum!” at a lone Trump supporter, then cackling with sadistic delight when the mob splatters the POTUS fan with a milkshake.Some social media users say that it is wrong to mention Prigent’s generous girth when commenting on her repulsive behaviour. Fat-shaming, they call it.  That’s rich!It was the protesters who made a great show of flying their big-bellied, fat- bottomed balloon.Sothere is fat-shaming being done, Siobhan Prigent’s side started it.IN a week of heroes, the bravery of one little girl shone brightest.Harmonie-Rose Allen lost her arms and legs to meningitis one month before her first birthday.It was my honour to know quite a few war veterans.They have all gone now, but every one of them would have saluted the courage of this incredible little girl.MILEY CYRUS protests abortion bans in some US states by posing with grapefruits over her bare breasts.“Don’t f*** with my freedom!” warns Miley.I HAVE my doubts about the remake of Worzel Gummidge with Mackenzie Crook playing the lead scarecrow.Jon Pertwee’s Worzel had a kind of raggedy, grandfatherly charm.This new Worzel looks like one of the undead coming to get you in Pirates Of The Caribbean.Who would have thought that Worzel Gummidge would ever lose his looks Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She had been trying to die for a long time. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands.Noa asked the Levenseinde end-of-le clinic in The Hague two years agoshe could be considered for euthanasia or assisted suicide but they — rightly — refused.She told De Gelderlander newspaper in December: “They consider that I am too young to die. They think I should finish my trauma treatment and that my brain must first be fully grown.That lasts until your st birthday. It’s broken me, because I can’t wait that long.” No one, surely, could read those words without agreeing that yes, she was too young to die. Right Most of us have enough le experience to know that, no matter how bad things are, or seem to be, dark clouds can hang around — but they do sht.Things change. Hopelessness gives way to hope. And dark often eventually becomes light. But Noa didn’t believe it.There is no doubt at all that her young le had been incredibly dficult. She’d had extensive treatment for depression and anorexia, and had tried to kill herself several times.She had been sexually assaulted at the age of  and raped at . She was so traumatised she didn’t want to live any more and, after repeated hospital stays, decided to stop treatment earlier this year.In what she referred to as a “sorrowful last post” on Instagram, Noa said she had “stopped eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it has been decided to let me go, because my suffering is unbearable”.A hospital bed was set up in her parents’ home and last week she refused all food and fluids after her parents and doctors reportedly agreed not to force-feed her.It is pretty much impossible for most of us to understand quite how desperate, resigned, despairing this woman’s parents must have been to have facilitated their daughter’s voluntary death.They must all have felt sure that there was no alternative. But it’s also hard to resist the urge to challenge that notion.There are so many examples of people — from Maya Angelou to Malala Yousafzai to JK Rowling — who have overcome adversity to make a huge success of their lives.I know many people who have overcome very dficult, challenging and dark times as teenagers who have gone on to create fulfilling and happy relationships and live rewarding and successful lives.I think it’s fair to say that, as a teenager, it’s impossible to imagine the future. It’s all too easy to be so mired in the dficulties of the present that you feel you will be stuck there for ever.Without in any way diminishing Noa’s suffering, I do know there were things that felt to me like a crisis at  that I barely now recall.I would take the view that it’s possible to get over even the most dficult challenges — evenit involves temporary defeat, sometimes total failure, it is how you react that sets your path.The big question that this story raises is, should we be allowed to choose to die  Ultimately, I think the answer to that is yes, we should. But does anyone know enough about living at the age of  to choose to die  I don’t think so.IT IS striking that this week a new Lancet study confirmed what many of us already know: Self-harm among young women and girls is rising at an “alarming” rate.What on earth is happening to our young people  Our young women in particular. What is the cause of this epidemic of self-loathing, self-harm, self-destruction When I was a teenager I had problems, sure, but nothing that would have driven me to harm myself.But so many parents now have to deal with their children hurting themselves as a daily reality – and my heart goes out to them. I don’t have the solution. But I do have a few theories about how to help kids thrive.Sport is really, really good for kids. It builds self-esteem and gives them another focus than themselves, their bodies, and whether they measure up to the people they follow on Instagram.Social media can be a force for good. But it can make young people feel really bad too. Help your kids to find other outlets, hobbies and passions.Talk to your kids about everything. And listen. Be un-shockable. My daughter – for better or worse! – still tells me everything. No subjects are taboo and they never have been or will be.If you accept your child for who they are, you will help them to be their authentic selves, rather than trying to be someone they are not. That is one of the greatest gts you can give them.I CONFESS to a tear in my eye watching the moment when Nicolas Mahut’s son rushed on court to console his father about losing to Leonardo Mayer at the French Open.Their hug was so heartfelt, and incredibly sweet and touching.It was a great reminder that relationships matter so much more than winning ever will.DID you hear the one about the woman who sold her husband’s £, football memorabilia for a fiver after seeing him cheating Shelly Cohen, , from Warrington, Cheshire, was sick of husband Paul putting his love of the beautul game before their relationship.When a friend texted her to say she’d seen her husband at a Manchester City match with another woman, that was it.She gathered together his prized memorabilia collection, which dates back  years, and listed it for sale on her husband’s OnBuy account.Then she flogged his £, memorabilia collection for a fiver. All I can say is: OUCH!SEEING all the state banquets this week has reminded me about my own visits to Buckingham Palace.I’ve been to white-tie events there as well as an intimate lunch with the Queen.I’ve also had dinner at Winfield House, which belongs to the American ambassador, in the same room that Trump had dinner.And they really are momentous occasions. I mean, just getting ready is fairly momentous.Although for most of them, despite the best-laid plans, I ended up rushing home from work and throwing something on.Some things I remember, in no particular order – after dinner, I really wanted to go to the toilet. But no one is allowed to leave until the Queen does, so I had to just hold on, and on, and on.I practised my curtsey before I went. That’s because when I was given my CBE by Prince William I was given so many instructions about how many steps to take to the left, right, and backwards that when the time came to curtsey I ended up doing a SQUAT!So I thought a YouTube tutorial might be a good idea. When our last course arrived – a plate with a bowl plus a cloth – I didn’t know what it was.Luckily, I was sitting next to the delightful Lord Chamberlain, Earl William Peel, who told me that the bowl was to wash fruit and the cloth was to dry it.Lastly, the Queen really is the world’s most professional conversationalist.She knew about the Olympic Stadium and football, and talked about both of them as though she was really interested.Despite all the pomp and ceremony, I was made to feel absolutely comfortable. But I definitely had more than a moment of thinking, “Pinch me, I’m at Buckingham Palace!”There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s trip was a great success. But my main take home from everything I saw was, what I wouldn’t give to have Melania’s wardrobe! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When she was growing up in Pakistan, village girls didn’t go to school.People in Westminster sometimes say to me, “Saj, you’ve got a great backstory.

I remember the pride in my mum’s eyes as her kids, with a decent education behind them, were able to succeed beyond her wildest dreams.I remember how she did all she could to lay the foundation for us to get on – leaving her home, living in poverty, working overnight at the Singer sewing machine in our kitchen to ensure we didn’t have to go to work but could get on with our studies.Hers is a unique story, but not that much dferent from the millions of Brits who make those sacrices for their children.So as Prime Minister – with the whole of the Government behind me – I will make our schools and colleges the envy of the world.Education will be my guiding mission in Downing Street. Today I’ve announced a plan that will transform our education and skills system.We’ll be there at the earliest years, to tackle the attainment gap. We’ll commission experts to deliver a multi-year, multi- billion-pound funding plan for our schools.And, as a former student of a further education college, I’ll treat them with the seriousness they deserve.For a changing economy, we’ll deliver skills and lelong learning to ensure that our people don’t just survive but thrive in the st century.There’s another thing I remember about my mum.She never let me make excuses.

There had been ten to  transactions all on the same day.It said it was for the game Fortnite, which I know my nephew plays, but he is six and so does not have a clue about money.He added: I told him not to buy anything, but he obviously got excited.That money was for a house I had been saving up for.Now Im absolutely skint.Murad said that when he rang his bank, staff said they had tried to make contact to warn him of unusual activity on his account.He said: Its so much money to go in one day, its just ridiculous.Thats four months of savings gone in one day.But Sony allows parents to create special child accounts that can be linked to your adult account.This lets you set a monthly spending limit, which is set to zero as standard.You can also set it higher, and then your children will be able to spend a limited amount of money each month.First, log into your main PS adult account.Then go to Settings gt Parental Controls gt Family Management.Choose Add Family Member gt Create User, and then enter your kids name and date of birth.Youll have to accept a user agreement, and then youll be given options to set specic parental controls.Xbox - Usually, the easiest way to avoid surprise Microsoft bills is by creating a special Xbox account with no payment details added.But playing Xbox multiplayer gamesrequires Xbox Live Gold Membership, which costs money.So that wont work in this case.However, you can create a special passcode thats required to very purchases.Just go Settings gt All Settings gt Accounts gt Sign-inThen choose Change My Sign-In  Security Preferences, and scroll right to Customise.Then scroll right again and select Ask For My Passkey To Make Purchases, and choose Passkey Required.Now all you have to do is pick a PIN number that your kids wont guess – so dont go with ,  or a birthday.Computer - Go into the account settings and then choose Payments.Once youre in there, simply make sure there arent any card details or linked PayPal accounts.If there are, you can very easily remove them.iPhone - Whenever you make a purchase on iPhone , youll always have to very it.Thatll be either by entering a password, using the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, or by scanning your face with Face ID.If your child doesnt know your password and isnt set up on any of these systems, youre largely safe.An email from Sony read: The transactions in question were made on a console with a dferent serial number from the one provided by you, but our investigations do not indicate that the account has been compromised as a result of internet fraud.The transactions are not eligible for a refund under the criteria outlined in the PlayStation Store cancellation policy and therefore we cannot offer a refund in this case.We do require the SEN account holder to be responsible for all activity on their account.Murad added: Sony is one of the biggest electrical companies in the world and they wont help me.Fortnite  -

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

U.S. researchers followed the sleeping habits of nearly , women.The study found those who kept a light or TV on while they snoozed at night were  per cent more likely to be obese than those in total darkness.And they had a  per cent higher chance of weighing in at least lbs heavier on the scales.They also were less likely to have consistent waking and bedtime patterns and at greater risk of having less sleep, taking a longer time to doze off and needing to nap during the day.Scientists claim cutting exposure to articial light at night may be a simple weapon in the battle against the bulge.Two in three UK adults are overweight or obese. Being too heavy increases the chances of type  diabetes, heart, liver disease and several common cancers.One theory is that light exposure alters key hormones that control the body clock. It may also trigger the release of stress hormones that contribute to weight gain.Writing in the JAMA Internal Medicine, researcher Dr Dale Sandler, from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, said: “Exposure to articial light at night while sleeping was signicantly associated with an increased risk of weight gain and the development of obesity.“In particular, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was positively associated with gaining kg or more.“Public health strategies to decrease obesity might consider interventions aimed at reducing articial light at night while sleeping.”Previous UK research has found girls who have TVs in their bedrooms are a third more likely to be fat.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said televisions and smartphones should be banned from kids’ rooms at night.He said: “It has been known for a long time that the blue, articial light emitted by TV screens - even those simply on stand-by - can mess up the bodys cyclical rhythms and disrupt sleep patterns.“Add to that research which has already linked interrupted sleep to obesity and diabetes and the case is made to ditch any gadget with a screen from the bedroom.Though adults might find that dficult, parents should make that a mandatory ban on their children .Commenting on the study, body clock expert Professor Malcolm von Schantz from Surrey University, said: “The findings make perfect biological sense.We know that light in the late evening will delay our body clocks. We know from experimental studies in people that light at night affects our metabolism in ways that are consistent with increased risk of metabolic syndrome.“These new findings won’t change the advice to maintain good sleep hygiene, and avoid light and electronic distractions in the bedroom, but they add further strength to the case for this advice.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its there - its in all the major cities across Europe and the US.“We have seen bush meat confiscated in the UK in check points at borders and in markets.”Other chimp experts have also expressed their alarm at the smuggling of chimpanzee meat.Dr Jane Goodall, who founded primate charity the Jane Goodall institute, told the paper: “The smuggling of bush meat is a very alarming issue.As Ben Garrod says, there is danger of disease spreading from the bush meat to humans.Dr Garrod said bush meat is still being sold at markets in many British cities, and is often eaten as a delicacy at weddings and christenings.The meat is thought to be a highly-rated delicacy and can sell up to five times the price of a prime cut of beef.He said: “From what I know, I cant imagine why people would want to eat chimpanzee, but most bush meat that comes to the UK is seen as a luxury food - its the equivalent of us wanting game.Dr Garrod highlighted the health risk to eating the meat, saying the next “big pandemic” could be spread through the illegally traded meat.He said that primate meat had already been confiscated in the US which had been infected with diseases that can be spread to humans.During a Trading Standards raid in the West Midlands in  chimpanzee meat was thought to have been detected.Research carried out on the importation of bush meat in Europe in  found that  tonnes had passed through the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris alone.A Government spokesperson said: “We take the smuggling of any contraband extremely seriously.“As well as working with enforcement and intelligence partners in the UK and internationally, Border Force continues to invest in training and equipment to ensure that we do all we can to intercept illegal foodstuffs and crack down on smugglers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may bbc free tv licence scrapped pensioners","story":"The Beeb sparked outrage with its decision to start means-testing for the giveaway.It means only over-s who receive Pension Credit will be eligible to claim the free TV licence fee from June  next year.It will see . million over-s dragged into paying the £. licence fee - the first time the age group will have to pay the charge since .Only . million will continue to get the free TV licence. Single OAPs over the age of  with a weekly income of less than £. or couples with a weekly income of less than £. will continue to qualy for the free TV licence.The PM said she was “very disappointed” with the decision and said it was a clear breach of its commitment to take on the financial burden of providing the giveaway.In a furious response to the announcement, the PM’s spokesman said: “We have been clear that we expected the BBC to continue this concession. We want the BBC to look again at ways of supporting older people.”He added: “As part of the long-term funding agreement, the BBC agreed to take on responsibility for this concession in  and we have been clear that we expected the BBC to continue this concession.“In  , it received over £. billion in licence fee income - more than the year before - and we have guaranteed the licence fee will increase with inflation until .“They are also making over £ billion a year from commercial work, such as selling content abroad, which can be reinvested.“It is the BBC’s responsibility to ensure its substantial licence fee income is used in an appropriate way so that it can deliver for UK audiences.”But critics blasted the PM for passing the buck - pointing out that her  General Election manesto pledged to keep the free TV licence.The Age UK charity warned the move will directly impact the sick and disabled.Labour’s former PM Gordon Brown warned that the move risked turning pensioners into criminals.He stormed: “This is the wrong decision, made in the wrong way by the BBC.“It should not be an agency for means-testing pensioners. Any costs should be covered by the Government without endangering BBC services.”And Labour’s deputy leader and Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson blamed the Government’s decision to handover control and burden of paying for free licences to the BBC as part of its new charter.Mr Watson said: “It is an outrage that this Government is overseeing the scrapping of free TV licences for three million older people, leaving a Tory manesto promise in tatters.“I challenge all Tory leadership candidates to honour the commitment they made in .

It’s an absolute disgrace.”Conservative Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: “The ending of historically free TV licences for all those over , regardless of income, will mark a signicant departure for the BBC and nearly four million pensioners who don’t pay for it.“We at the DCMS Committee will continue to monitor the BBC, and in particular the impact that this cost will have on the BBC’s future and its programming.“The select committee intends to question the chairman and director-general of the BBC about the results of its consultation and the impact this will have on viewers and listeners.”The free licence fee was first paid for by a Labour government in .WHO is affected by this Around . million over-s who are not eligible to claim Pension Credit.Single OAPs over  with a weekly income of less than £. or couples with a weekly in- come of less than £. will continue to qualy for the free TV licence.An estimated . million over-s will continue to get the free TV licence.When will the changes come in June , .Why is this happening  Because David Cameron’s government de­c­ided to hand over control and the burden of funding the TV licence fee to the BBC as part of the new charter agreement with the broadcaster.Is it likely to be reviewed A future government might review the decision to hand control of the fee to the BBC, but the broadcaster is unlikely to change its decision by itself having consulted widely on the move. THE BBC spends fortunes on its highly-paid stars’ salaries.

More than a dozen spoke up at the frosty gathering in Parliament - the vast majority negative, a source said - as rows over Brexit and anti-Semitism came to a head. MPs argued over whether Mr Corbyn should fully back a second Brexit referendum after coming third behind the Lib Dems in the EU elections. There was also a row over allegations Mr Corbynaposs staff, named in newspapers, intervened in anti-Semitism cases. Multiple MPs described the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting as the worst ever under his leadership. An MP told the Mirror: It was the worst meeting Iaposve ever attended. Of anything. Normally-quiet MPs, including James Frith and Marie Rimmer, spoke up to Jeremy Corbynaposs face. Ms Rimmer is said to have told him loyal allies are turning away, adding: The leadership’s not there.    According to HuffPost UK, Mr Frith told Mr Corbyn: Your clear leadership delivered my win in . We need clear leadership from you now - for a final say public vote and Remain.” A source close to the leader admitted the meeting was robust, though allies insisted it was not the worst ever. It comes ahead of a showdown today over Labouraposs Brexit policy at a meeting of the shadow cabinet. Speaking at last nightaposs meeting, Mr Corbyn said: To break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament. But several shadow ministers - including Tom Watson, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry - want Mr Corbyn to go further and guarantee a referendum on any deal. Itaposs understood Mr Watson confronted party chairman Ian Lavery - a key opponent of a second referendum - at last weekaposs shadow cabinet and demanded a plan to re-engage the trust of party members.    Meanwhile new MP Lisa Forbes faced a furious attack at the meeting - on her first day representing Peterborough. She apologised for liking a post saying Theresa May had a “Zionist Slave Masters agenda”, alongside a video of children praying after the New Zealand terror attack. In another comment, she had said she had “enjoyed reading” a thread that said Isis was created “by the CIA and Mossad”. But she was lambasted by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who said she didnapost accept the apology and accused Ms Forbes of a pattern of behaviour, a witness claimed. Allies of Mr Corbyn - who joined just  or so MPs applauding Ms Forbes into office yesterday - bristled at the attack, which comes after a long history of spats between Ms Hodge and the leader. A supporter complained: Itaposs not right to lay into someone who just started their job that day.  MPs also called for better processes to handle conduct complaints in the party after an anti-Semitism row. The Sunday Times obtained emails suggesting Jeremy Corbynaposs chief of staff, Karie Murphy, stepped in halting a suspension of an aide accused of sexual advances. Mr Corbyn is said to have urged MPs not to single out members of Labour staff. But a witness said Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle argued against this, comparing senior staff to chief executives of a company under attack by unions. A source said of the meeting to Playbook: It got genuinely nasty... It was up there with the very worst. You saw the depth of unhappiness within the PLP. Some of the people speaking out, you just never would have expected to hear it from. A Labour source called the meeting “robust”, adding: Clearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country – and among Labour MPs. That’s no secret at all. “We are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs. The PLP is very passionate, and that’s what we would expect.

Wheatley Park School near Oxford is proposing to remove an hour-long period at the end of its Friday timetable. The academy in Holton, which teaches , students, said the move would cut costs by reducing staffing requirements. A letter sent to parents said: School budgets are under enormous pressure and our own is no exception. The school currently has some reserves but will quickly tip into deficit unless we can find further ways to reduce costs signicantly. Reducing the school week by one period would mean fewer lessons would need to be taught overall, which in turn would mean fewer teachers would be needed to staff the school. It comes after repeated dire warnings about school funding - with two-thirds of teachers forking out their own cash for stationery.     Yet a letter from more than , heads earlier this year claimed Education Secretary Damian Hinds has refused three requests to meet to discuss the crisis. And the UK Statistics Authority rebuked the Education Department last year for exaggerating the amount of spending going into schools. Theresa May has also repeatedly claimed . million more children are in schools rated “good” or “outstanding” by Ofsted - but that claim too has been branded misleading by the statistics watchdog. Mrs May won a place at the then Holton Park Girlsapos Grammar School at  and was a pupil there when it became Wheatley Park School in .  She then went on to study at St Hughaposs College at Oxford University. The school has been improving in recent years - it was rated aposinadequateapos by Ofsted in , apossatisfactoryapos in  and aposgoodapos in its most recent full inspection in . The proposal for Fridays would come into force from Septemberconfirmed. Lunchtime would be brought forward about an hour and students would go home at pm instead of pm. Although pupils would leave earlier, some staff would stay to work on collaborative lesson planning and curriculum development.    The letter added: Parents and carers might be rightly concerned that having  instead of  lessons a week would be detrimental to childrenaposs education. However, the school would seek to minimise any negative impact on studentsapos learning by protecting lessons in the core subjects. We anticipate that more collaborative planning amongst staff would increase the quality of lessons, offsetting the reduction in quantity. The letter, from the schoolaposs headteacher Tim Martin and chair of governors Philip Baillieu, said alternative measures had been considered, including removing subjects, creating bigger classes or asking parents for donations. The school is consulting with present and future pupils and parents, staff and the River Learning Trust, which runs Wheatley Park, and a final decision is expected imminently. The trust, which also runs Oxfordaposs Cherwell School and a host of others in the area, is also opening the cityaposs new Swan School. Wheatley Park head Mr Martin was among headteachers who marched in a London protest last year, lobbying for more school funding.  He said: Itaposs our genuine belief that this option has the least impact on studentsapos learning. Schools up and down the country are having to make very dficult decisions in the current financial climate - itaposs our view that [the government] not investing in education is a short-term outlook. He pointed to other neighbouring schools, Didcot Girlsapos and neighbouring St Birinus, which already finish early on Fridays as a examples of the system working. The school is not alone in Oxfordshire in contacting parents about funding struggles. On Friday, headteachers of  partnered schools in West Oxfordshire, including Henry Box and Wood Green, sent a letter urging parents to contact their MP about funding. They said: The past decade has seen a real terms cut to the funding [education services] receive. The UK statistics network has scolded the government for headlines that mask the whole picture. Schools are being expected to do signicantly more, with more children, with signicantly less. The heads said the aposregrettableapos next step would be to make cuts in the staffing budget, which is any schoolaposs biggest expenditure.

The -year-old said: Two years after we started trying to fall pregnant it still wasnapost happening. We went for tests but everything came back normal. We were told everything was perfect, so why werenapost we falling pregnant  But Hannah and Adam were determined to keep trying for their own little family. Heartbreakingly, Hannah admits each month she was almost certain the pregnancy test would come back negative but that she had to do one to keep her from obsessing about the result.    And for Adam he did all he could to support his partner as they tried for their much longed for family. He said: It was heartbreaking to see her go through the emotion and also to pick her up when it wasnapost positive. Devastatingly, the couple had a  positive test only for their hopes to be dashed when they werenapost actually pregnant. Finally, in December last year Hannah and Adam went to see a fertility specialist in their home town of Maidstone.More heartbreak was to follow when tests came back showing Hannahaposs level of a particular hormone were too low and they werenapost eligible for IVF . To pay for IVF privately would cost £,. Hannah said: Thataposs for just one chance, which only has a  percent chance of working and only an  percent chance of working the first time. Then, something amazing happened - their NHS consultant agreed to test Hannahaposs hormone levels for a second time. The result was what they had been waiting for and the couple could have NHS funded IVF - they were over the moon. Hannah and Adam started their IVF with the Care Fertility Clinic in Tunbridge Wells in May and, determined to raise awareness about fertility issues, continued to film their journey.  In it together, Adam made sure he was the one to give Hannah all of her injections. The -year-old said: From a male point of view you feel hopeless. Itaposs the woman going through everything and there was a lot riding on Hannahaposs body. Hannah added: Although it was dficult we looked at it and thought aposwe are finally doing somethingapos. After the treatment ended, Hannah and Adam faced an agonising two week wait to find outit had worked.  And even though everything had gone smoothly, the couple tried to prepare themselves for another negative pregnancy test. Hannah said: Iaposve known people go through five rounds of IVF and I just kept thinking aposit canapost be this easy for usapos. Then came the day of the test. Like every other, Hannah and Adam got ready to film their reaction as they desperately hoped the test would show a positive result. Hannah said: I turned it round and saw the two lines but it didnapost register straight away - I was finally pregnant.  The couple say they know they have a long way to go before they hold their much wanted baby in their arms for the first time. But they couldnapost resist buying him or her their first adorable baby grow - covered in the words aposthe little embryo that couldapos. Hannah and Adam donapost want their struggle to be in vain and are determined to use their experiences to get people talking about fertility issues.Sharing the emotional video of their long journey to pregnancy on Facebook , Hannah and Adam hoped to include the friends and family who had provided them with such invaluable support.But their heartwrenching journey has now been viewed more than , times, shared thousands of times with thousands more people sharing their own stories and spreading support for those still struggling.

The brutal slaughter of three young children in their own house by a man they should have been able to trust. David McGreavy slaughtered eight month old baby Samantha, Dawn, two, and David, four, at their home in Worcester in . And now the childrenaposs devastated mother has claimed the killer is free. When their father, Clive Ralph, left them in the care of the man who he had welcomed into the family home as a lodger, the three were sleeping peacefully in bed. McGreavy was known for his affection for children, especially those he shared a home with, so the decision to leave him in charge of them was a simple one.    But when Clive ed from collecting their mother, Elsie, from work the house was a blood bath and his children had been murdered by the man who was supposed to be protected them. There was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Aged just , McGreavy had flown into a drunken rage because baby Samantha started crying for her bottle. He strangled her with his hands and she eventually died from a fracture to her skull. McGreavy then turned his murderous intention to the other youngsters. He slit two-year-old Dawnaposs throat and strangled Paul, four, with a wire.  After the violent murders he then mutilated their tiny bodies with a pickaxe and impaled them on a neighbouraposs fence. It earned him the chilling nickname the aposMonster of Worcesterapos and McGreavy was jailed for  years for the brutal crime. Aged just  at the time of the killings, no one could have predicted the terrying events of that night. The childrensapos mother even claimed McGreavy was like a father to the trio and he had been known to criticise her when she disciplined Paul. McGreavy had moved into the family home when Elsie was pregnant with her youngest daughter. He immediately became a much-loved part of the family, often cooking Sunday dinner and babysitting for the three children.  His crime stunned the nation - how could a man who adored the children he was living with subject them to such horror  McGreavyaposs family were also baffled. His father, Tom McGreavy, said: Everyone who knew David knew that he loved children. But the affable young man who had become a key part of family le for the Ralphaposs was hiding a dark past. Born in Southport in , he was the second oldest of six children and spent much of his childhood moving between army bases as his father was a sergeant in the army. His early le pushed him to pursue a career in the Armed Forces and by  he had quit school and enlisted in the Navy.  In the late sixties, and stationed in Portsmouth, McGreavy joined his first ship, HMS Eagle. Described by colleagues as a arrogant young man and cocky McGreavy found himself subject to several disciplinary procedures. But then he started drinking and his career began to unravel. While working as a steward in the mess hall he spotted his name had been written in a Chief Petty Officeraposs Book. Worried this could mean he was about to be told he was changing jobs he reached for booze. Criminologist Dr Elizabeth Yardley said: He actually broke into an officeraposs ward room and set fire to a bin that had papers in it.  He said he did this mistakenly, by accidentally dropping a cigarette end, and he did raise the alarm at :am. He expected the Navy to believe he was just an innocent eye witness, they saw beyond that and he was court marshalled. He was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to  days detention. By  he had fallen in love with a woman called Mary, who he proposed to just one week after meeting her for the first time. In the same year his career in the Navy had collapsed and he was dismisssed and he was forced tohome to his parents. A series of jobs followed, from chef to labourer, but they all eneded the same way - he was sacked.  His attitude, arrogance and alcohol were all cited as reasons. McGreavy now put all his focus on his upcoming marriage to Mary - and he wanted a huge white wedding with all the trimmings. But on New Yearaposs Eve  Mary ended the engagement, leaving McGreavy devasated. Depressed and sulking while living with his parents, McGreavy moved into with his school friend, Clive Ralph. Cliveaposs decision to allow him to lodge with his family would have devastating consequences. The father had married Elsie when she was just  and pregnant with their first child and worked hard as a lorry driver to provide for his growing family. Living conditions in the two-bed house were cramped.  McGreavy shared a bed with little Paul while baby Samantha was in a cradle cot in her parentsapos room and Dawn slept in a bed next to her mum and dad. Cliveaposs lorry driving job meant he was regularly away from home and Elsie was grateful for McGreavyaposs help in caring for the children and running the home. A genial man who was adored by the family and liked by those who knew him, once again his personality completely changed whe he drank. McGreavy was arrested several times for being drunk in public and his father warned him to stop. But his refusal to listen cost three young children their lives. On the night of the killings McGreavy had been drinking in a pub with a friend. He drank between five and seven pints and played cards and darts.  Clive picked him up so he could babysit the children while he went to collect Elsie from her own job in another pub. Nothing could have prepared the couple for the scene that greeted them when they ed home. The walls were drenched with blood and there was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Police found their bodies impaled on the fence an hour later. At the time the sight was so hideous that Detective Superintendent Bob Booth, head of West Mercia CID, said: No investigating officer has ever had to witness that such a scene of indescribable horror. When police arrested McGreavy he initially denied carrying out the gruesome murders. By the following afternoon, he snapped and confessed. During his police interview he slumped forward and started sobbing.  McGreavy said: It was all too bloody gruesome. It was me but it was not me, how could I do it  On Paul I used the wire. Everything just seem to cave in.  I picked up the pickaxe and used all of them then I went outside and put them on the railings. All I can hear is the kids, kids f****** kids. I did the same to Dawn and used the piece of curtain wire on Paul. Asked why he had killed the three innocent children, McGreavy replied: That is what I have been trying to figure out. He pleaded guilty to the murders in a hearing that lasted just eight minutes. Most of his sentence has been served with him under protection as he has been subject to abuse from other prisoners.  In , McGreavy was transferred to an open prison and now he has been cleared for release. The news has come as a devastating blow to their mother, now Elsie Urry after re-marrying. She is terried she will see him on the street. McGreavy would be subject to exclusion zones including where Mrs Urry lives - but they could still bump into one another where. The Parole Board said a victim was entitled to request for conditions to be added to a release licence. Mrs Urry  told the BBC  : I go to Basingstoke... with my brother, where they live, and things like that and it doesnapost... cover that does it  She added: Thereaposs people in prison who have done murders, not half as bad as what heaposs done, and yet they havenapost been put up for parole, so why should he get it  "},{"url":null,"title":"house worlds most amazing view","story":"NewsHouse with the worlds most amazing view for sale in the UK - but it isnt cheapThe house in Cumbrias Lake District comes with totally unspoilt views and looks like something out of a fairytaleShareCommentsByJane Lavender:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe house has completely unspoilt views \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf the thought of waking up to one of the most amazing views in the world appeals we have good news.A home has gone on sale with what have been described as the most exquisite panoramic mountain views in the world - and itaposs right here in the UK.The five bedroom property sits in the Bassenthwaite Valley in the Lake District, Cumbria.

Sadly, Faye was then quite a private person and she found it dficult to open up to others about how she felt. She first started to self-harm at  and would wear long sleeves to cover up her injuries. As a result of her struggling to grieve the death of her father, she became more disruptive in school. “When she was , she took an overdose while in school and as a result of this, she started to see her GP and was prescribed anti-depressants. “Around May , just before her th birthday, she took an overdose and was taken to hospital, and she was sectioned just after her birthday.

Miss Larkin was initially placed in a community care home in Bradford but was later transferred to a Fielderaposs Lodge, an NHS residential home in Salford, after her first home closed down. She was diagnosed with a complex personality disorder and put on a care plan. Although she would stay in the home, she was free to go out as she pleased. In the final six months of her le, her mental health began to “signicantly deteriorate” and she made several attempts at taking her le.  I convinced her to stay and relax with her family and we had a delightful evening together. On December , she sent me a text message saying she was coming to sleep at my house. I was asleep and I woke up to find Faye in my bedroom. We hugged each other and went straight to sleep.“I awoke the next morning and she said that she was meeting a friend. The last picture she posted was on Instagram at around pm and she was having lunch with that friend.Then at am on December , a policeman knocked on my door and told me that she had taken her own le in a wooded area. “I want to knowmore could have been done by Fielder Lodge to prevent this incident from occurring. Faye had recently been prescribed dferent medication, so I want to knowshe was monitored. I want to knowstaff complied with the care plans in place. “I want to knowthere had been text or phone conversations between Faye and the Fielder’s Lodge staff and were they worrying. I already know there was a pm text message and I want to know why Fielder’s Lodge didn’t let us know about worrying texts. “She had complex mental health issues, and she attempted to take her le on a number of occasions. There was a specic incident where Faye took a taxi to a bridge, climbed up the steps and jumped off. She suffered many injuries and required surgery. Mental health nurse, Katie Horton confirmed Miss Larkin had made several attempts to take her own le in the six months before her death but told the inquest: aposaposIt came as a surprise and a shock to me to hear what happened to her. aposaposI saw her the previous Friday and she was in a positive mood. She was well presented and talking about the future and Christmas. She was quite an articulate lady, she was good at arts and crafts and baking. She was a very thoughtful lady. “My last contact with Faye was on December . She was well presented, she had make-up on, and she was planning for Christmas. She handed me a letter that she had been preparing for several weeks and wished to discuss it at the meeting planned for December . ”We wanted to work with Faye and we prescribed her with dferent medication to help her manage her stress. She was fully engaging with staff at Fielder’s Lodge following these incidents and she was assessed under the Mental Health Act.” The inquest continues.If you need help on an emotional issue you can call the Samaritans free, at any time, on  .

A royal source told The Express : “The Queen feels the Duke has earned a proper retirement.    She knows him too well,he was still at the centre of royal le heaposd feel he had to be involved.

While Her Majesty can be separated from her beloved for several weeks at a time, the couple are believed to speak on the phone every day. Charlie Proctor, editor of Royal Central, told Daily Star Online that Philip spends little time at Buckingham Palace.    He said: “Unlike most married couples, The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh often live miles apart, with Prince Philip spending hardly any time at Buckingham Palace these days. Mr Proctor said the Duke viewed Buckingham Palace as a work place.

It is an obsession the American doctor estimates has cost her thousands over the past eight years. Dr Danielle Magness, , has been following the Duchess of Cambridgeaposs impeccable style ever since she stepped out in her stunning blue Issa engagement dress in November . The Hanska, Minnesota fan has been swept up in the aposKate Effectapos ever since.    An avid fashionista, Danielle takes part in style challenges on social media and would often find herself posting aposreal-Kateapos, the identical item of clothing as Kate Middleton has worn or aposrepli-Kateapos, a similar outfit she had worn.Danielle then decided to start an Instagram account to document her royal-inspired looks.Danielle follows the Duchessapos calendar of events andan outfit fits with her budget and own style sheaposll try to buy it before it sells out. She says she can take months finding repli-Kates of an outfit or the original piece on websites like eBay or Poshmark. Luckily for Danielle, she shares a similar style to Kate and finds that her outfits are suitable for work and for when sheaposs playing with her three-year-old son.    Incredible pictures show how Danielle has perfected the Duchessapos effortless style in the stunning floral print  Other Stories dress Kate wore to the RHS Cha Flower Show in May this year. She also rocked the bargain Zara summer dress worn by Kate to the polo in June last year, and the Seraphine lacey blue dress worn at the opening of the PlaceBe headquarters last March. Other timeless looks Danielle has recreated include the casual Durbarry jacket worn by Kate in January this year, the stunning emerald green Dolce and Gabbana frock worn by Kate in Canada in  and a repli-Kate of the Ralph Lauren houndstooth dress worn by Kate in September  on herto royal duties following the birth of Princess Charlotte. When I saw her for the first time in the beautul blue Issa dress I fell in love with her style, she said. At that time and especially during the London Summer Olympics was when I started following her style. The Kate effect started at this time and I guess I was taken over by it.    Her look is classic, but she does utilise trends which keep her looking up to date. Her style is similar to mine which is important since I will be able to wear her outfits to work or even when Iaposm active with my three-year-old son. I will follow her calendar of events that she is scheduled to attend. These calendars are usually found posted on blogs. If there is an event where she may wear a dress or outfit that could be within my budget I will try to purchase it right away.The piece must be within my budget and follow my style. I try very hard to purchase the item before it sells out. In order to do this, I may have to be checking Instagram or Facebook throughout the day with the hope that the piece will be identied.   For pieces that Iaposm not able to purchase directly from the store or need to repli-Kate it may take months of trying to find similar pieces or the actual piece on eBay or Poshmark. I just regularly check and I might be lucky and that piece will show up. I can find some real-Kate pieces on certain websites such as Poshmark, The Real Real, The Outnet and eBay. Usually these real-Kate pieces are less then what the actual cost was when sold at the original store. I do watch for sales at Kate Spade, LK Bennett, Zara, Reiss and Tory Burch. If I find a piece that I really want and feel I will be able to meet my cost per wear goal I will invest in the piece of clothing or accessory. I have found repli-Kate pieces on Etsy and aliexpress. There are stores on Esty who actually make repli-Kates of pieces that are usually very expensive and are very well made.    For a replicated outfit I may spend between - all the pieces are just repli-Kates. If some of the pieces are real-Kate then the amount may be higher. If I am going to invest in a real-Kate piece, then I take into consideration the cost per wear. If the piece or accessory is within my budget and I really like it then I will purchase it. I allow myself a monthly aposKateapos allowance to purchase items that she may be seen wearing that month at events. I consider purchasing items that appear to fit my style and are within my budget. As a psychiatrist, Danielle has been very impressed by Kateaposs work in mental health.As well as copying Kateaposs looks, Danielle has also started to imitate those of Pippa Middleton and Meghan Markle but says those items made specically for the royals are the most dficult to replicate.   They do charitable work such as Kate focusing on mental health. Since Iaposm a psychiatrist I am very thankful that she is helping to make mental health less of a stigma, she said. They bring people together by creating a sense of nationality and patriotism. Kate appears to be compassionate and brings people together. She is also a great role model. Since itaposs been about eight years that I have been following her style Iaposm unable to give an exact amount but I would estimate itaposs in the thousands with purchasing repli-Kates but also real-Kate items.  Fashion is my hobby and Kate is one of my favourite fashion icons. Her sister, Pippa and now Meghan Markle are two others who I also follow and this has increased the amount that I have spent. Any gown that has been made specically for her is dficult to find. Such as ones by Alexander McQueen. Sometimes similar ones can be found on Etsy or repli-Kates from aliexpress.    The key is to be persistent. If there is an outfit that you love, then you will eventually find a repli-Kate or a real-Kate for a great price. It is not going to happen right after she wears the outfit but over the months or maybe years you may be lucky and find that piece that you love.Follow Danielleaposs Instagram here ."},{"url":null,"title":"teen red faced after dad","story":"NewsTeen red-faced after dad copies all her Facebook selfies with hilarious resultsRiley Anderson, , from Vancouver, Canada, was mortied at first by dad Jonathan Russells photos - but now thinks its brilliantShareCommentsByMollie Mansfield:,  JUN NewsThe pair leave their friends in giggles \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A teenager has been left red-faced after her dad decided to copy all of her selfies on Facebook - to the delight of her followers.For the past year, Riley Anderson, , cannot log onto Facebook without receiving a notication saying that her dad, Jonathan Russell, , had posted a photo on her profile.

Shakeela, , says she was held against her will for three hours on the first day of Eid last week in her home town in Pakistan. She claims she was threatened with further violenceshe did not hand over one million rupeesto the gang. The -year-old, who works as a dancer in the city of Mardan, had given money to the gang twice before. The first time, she paid , rupees and the second , rupees, to keep them at bay for a while so she could continue to work and dance in the area. But on this occasion they had demanded a huge amount. Shakeela is now speaking out about her ordeal in the hope of getting local police to investigate the attack.    Farzana Jan, the president of Trans Action and the first Pakistani to have a gender-neutral ‘X’ passport, toldthat one of the reasons why Shakeela was targeted was that trans women are seen as vulnerable and an easy target. She said in the last four years  transgender people have been killed while over  have been tortured.Farzana told: ‘There is an organised group of criminal gangs who specically target the transgender community because they are more vulnerable.‘They’re involved not only in the sexual exploitation of the transgender community but they extort money from them. ‘They are seen as weak and easy targets.’ Speaking about Shakeela, she said it was impossible for her to pay the money demanded.  In Pakistan, homosexuality is illegal but last year new laws were introduced allowing people to self-identy their gender on official documents. Yet despite the change, the transgender community is still being targeted by gangs in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Farzana said attacks like these happen throughout the region, some victims pay the money, some are killed or tortured.  And unfortunately, despite some arrests being made, they almost never lead to conviction. The Trans Action president is hoping Shakeelaaposs case will shed light on the problem in Pakistan. Trans Action is the first ever organized community movement of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which represent  to  transgender and intersex community from  districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administrated Tribal Areas . They work to end transphobia and break barriers for sexual and gender minorities in conservative Pakistan.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"rugby-stars-return-home-to-celebrate-all-things-made-in-hawick","story":"SCOTTISH rugby stars Stuart Hogg and Darcy Graham are back in their hometown this week to help celebrate all things ldquoMade in Hawick.The Murrayfield regulars launched a new website which promotes the townrsquos world class products.The Made in Hawick campaign and new website ndash www.madeinhawick ndash is a partnership between several leading manufacturers in the town and the Future Hawick town regeneration group.And has been supported by grant funding from Scottish Borders Council.Hawick has a worldwide reputation for the quality of its textile and knitwear products, built up over hundreds of years of manufacturing in the townrsquos mills.

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job.

South East Scotland Transport Partnership , the project centres around three main messages.Do The Ride Thing promotes good cycling manners, cycling as a positive travel choice and how easy electric bikes make cycling.TweedLove and the Tweeddale area benefit from an off-road path linking the Tweed Valley towns of Peebles, Innerleithen and Walkerburn.With the path being so popular with many users including cyclists, walkers, runners and horse-riders, Do The Ride Thing sets out to encourage good cycling manners when using the path, and cycling in general, to ensure all users feel safe and comfortable.At TweedLoversquos annual event the GO e-bike Family Ride, supported by Frog Bikes, all participants will be provided with a Do The Ride Thing bike bell.This aims to encourage the message of good cycling manners on the path and negate the problem of cyclists approaching other users at speed with no warning.A small gesture which will hopefully have a huge benefit to the users of the multi-use path.Hillside Outside created TweedLove to encourages cycling as a mode of transport, on any sort of bike, and showcases the ease of using the Tweed Valley Railway Path.Harley Lothian, Hillside Outside, said: ldquoIt is well-known that adopting cycling as a mode of transport provides many benefits from improved physical and mental health to positive environmental impacts, and it has recently become much easier with the introduction of electric bikes.ldquoTweeddale benefits from its own GO e-bike hub based in Innerleithen to provide the local community access to electric bikes for personal use.ldquoAnd electric cargo bikes for the business community, making it easier to adopt cycling as a transport method in the Tweed Valley.ldquoDo The Ride Thing will continue to promote these messages through a number of dferent avenues over the next few months.Participation is free for the Family Ride event, which will take participants on a journey along the Tweed Valley Railway path departing from Tweed Green on Sunday June  at .am.Full details can be found at tweedlove.More information on the Do The Ride Thing project visit dotheridethingAnd for more information on GO e-Bike

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us. It was a humiliating experience.And he claimed: ldquoThe security guards were very intimidating, especially to the children. We were all treated like criminals, even though the majority of us hadnrsquot done anything wrong.ldquoMy daughter even turned to me at one point in tears, asking: lsquoWersquove done nothing wrong, why are we getting thrown out rsquoldquoI understand some of the behaviour was unacceptable, but there were young children on the trip and they should have been taken into account before the decision was made. To punish everyone for the actions of a small few seems very unfair.Flamingo Land did not respond for requests for a comment this week,Last week, spokesperson Andy Miller said: ldquoThe anti-social behaviour which was displayed by members of the football team in question couldnrsquot be tolerated as it was interfering with other guestsrsquo enjoyment.

Warmer summers and milder winters could increase opportunities for year-round outdoor recreation and leisure.Changes to marine le could also provide an opportunity, the report claims, adding that ldquowarmer waters may see the arrival of new commercial fish species, which could boost the local fishing industry.It even manages to find a positive in predictions that substantial smog episodes, which were seen in  in Europe, could become typical by , increasing summer pollution.It said: ldquoEpisodes of winter smog, by contrast, are likely to be less prevalent due to higher wind speeds which will help disperse pollutants.A warmer climate could also, the report says, improve residentsrsquo health by encouraging more outdoor activities in the summer and reducing a reliance on heating helping reduce fuel poverty.However, the report was unable to come up with the positives when it came to the impact on emergency services and coastal erosion, both of which only identied risks.The council has launched a public consultation on its draft climate change strategy for the next five years.It aims to reduce its carbon emissions by . per cent annually and work towards a zero waste target.It said: ldquoThe strategy sets out how the council will tackle climate change, and how it will work in partnership with our local communities, businesses, organisations and iniduals to ensure that East Lothian can play its full part in the national and international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.ldquoThe strategy will contribute to raising awareness of climate change challenges and opportunities in EastLothian.ldquoIt also sets out the priorities and actions for the council and the wider East Lothian community to mitigate against and reduce the impactsof climate change and the inequalities that can result.Among the councilrsquos proposals to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions are: continuing to improve the energy efficiency of homes and public buildings reduce, reuse and recycle waste improving active travel and sustainable transport networks and promoting behaviour change to more sustainable travel choices supporting local businesses to improve resource efficiency and sustainability and managing the natural environment to off-set carbon emissions.An eight-week consultation period on the draft strategy is open.Angela Leitch, council chief executive, said: ldquoThe draft climate change strategy is an important piece of work which sets out how the council will tackle climate change locally and also how it will work in partnership to ensure that East Lothian as a community can play its full part in the national and international efforts to reduce carbon emissions.ldquoClimate change is one of the defining issues of our times.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9969119.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-generosity-to-charities-takes-a-dramatic-tumble","story":"The amount donated by Scottish people to charity in  fell by nearly %from a high of pound. billion in  to poundm last year.The Charities Aid Foundationrsquos annual Scotland Giving report, based on monthly polling over ,  and  found, however, that Scots were more generous that the UK as a whole.In total, % of Scots reported that they had taken part in a charitable or social activity in ,  percentage points higher than the UK average of %.But Sir John Low, the CAF chief executive admitted there were were some \"worrying trends\" in giving money to charity, sponsoring friends, family or loved ones in charitable pursuits and the frequency with which we give, with the overall amount donated by Scots on the wane.CAF said they had seen a \"signicant decline\" in the percentage of iniduals giving money to charity, both in terms of the last  months and the last four weeks.Those deciding to make a donation in the last  months dropped from % to % between  and  and those having given in the previous four weeks dropped from % to % over the same period.When it comes to sponsoring someone for charity there was a similar decline over the three years - with % giving in the last  months compared to % in .Meanwhile those saying they \"strongly\" or \"tend to\" trust charties in  fell to % from % in .Susan Pinkney, the CAFs head of research said there is scope for charities across the country to use these figures as a catalyst for \"greater engagement\" with the Scottish people.\"This can also act as an opportunity to reassure them that their favourite charities are worth their time, effort and hard-earned money,\" she added.While the reasons \"are no doubt myriad\" she pointed to a drop in trust in institutions and financial uncertainty over Brexit as being a major factor in the drop.\"There is no denying that the mood music and general tone of public discourse has become more isive in the UK since the Brexit vote in ,\" she said.\"It is entirely possible that it has fed into a sense of uncertainty which may, in turn, affect giving decisions. That would echo the feelings of business in the country who have been calling for clarity above all  as they plan their future investment plans. Donating to charity is, of sorts, an investment in our wider community.\"We are [also] hearing about a prevailing sense of a lack of trust in major institutions, including charities and that is no doubt playing a role in the data we are seeing. This view is backed up by other researchers and we are hearing a consistent message from the public on this topic.\"That said, the trust numbers for Scotland are slightly higher than the UK as a whole ndash hinting at a slightly higher level of resilience among Scotlandrsquos charities.\"She said CAF would be closely monitoring the percent of Scots who say they trust charities, as there has been a general decline across the UK.\"If people lack trust, that means they worry that their hard-earned money is being well-spent when entrusted to charities. This is a challenge that the charity sector needs to tackle head on and find way to inspire people to give and demonstrate to them that their money is making a real dference,\" she said.\"Additionally, and this perhaps merits new investigations from organisations such as ours, the changing face of our workforce may be a factor. With more and more people working in the lsquogigrsquo economy, going freelance or working on shorter contracts, that opportunity to sign up for regular giving is diminished.\"Ms Pinkney added: \"It is worth stressing though that the UK as a wholeremains one of the worldrsquos most generous countries ndash something that we should rightly celebrate, although what this report is telling us is that it is not something we should take for granted.\"CAF, which has been producing the UK Giving report since , and has been tracking giving in the UK for several decades, is based on the testimony of , iniduals in Scotland each year.It found that the top three causes that people chose to support remained the same across the three years: children and young people, medical research and animal welfare.It also found there was a decrease in the methods by which people are asked to give, with on-the-street and direct mail in particular having fallen back year on year.In  the proportion of people who said they had volunteered in Scotland over the previous four weeks was \"signicantly lower\" at % compared to % in .And women in Scotland are are more likely than men to have volunteered, with % having done so in the last year compared to % of men.Sir John Low added: \"The report finds not only has the number of people giving gone down ndash with a corresponding lack in funds being raised ndash but the frequency with which people are giving is also in decline. Combined, this presents a worrying picture.\"People give because they are inspired, because they are touched by a charityrsquos work and because they know that their donations make a tangible dference. It rests with all of us to make the case on behalf of our charities, be they small groups gathering in a village hall to address a local need or a national organisation tackling widespread issues.\"In Scotland, charities provide invaluable services, but they also serve to bring our communities together in a bid to make the world a better place.

Drivers should ensure their vehicles are road worthy at all times and not just when it comes to MOT time. “We will continue to give attention to the A as well as other roads in the North East.” data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jill accepting the award\"  Director picks up awardviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Bam Nuttall will carry out the work on the new Kintore Station\"  Firm awarded Kintore station contract viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"neighbours object to brewdog s inverurie pub hours","story":"Neighbours of BrewDog#s newly-opened bar in Inverurie have raised objections to their formal premises licence.The brewery is seeking the green light to continue operating from am to midnight Sunday to Thursday and from am to am Friday and Saturday.It also wants to continue providing off-sales from am to pm Monday to Sunday.Aberdeenshire Central Licensing Board will debate the application on Wednesday, June .It will hear from two residents who have questioned the need for the ‘Heart of Hops’ premises to trade until am at a weekend.One neighbour, who stays just metres away from the bar’s outside seating area, says: “We feel that the opening hours till am are unacceptable due to noise which will carry to our home.“We were under the impression that closing time would be the normal pm.”Another questions how the outdoor area will be effectively managed to avoid neighbourhood disturbance.Licensing standards officers have recommended restricted use of the outdoor area and that it should not be used until noon daily and close by pm Sunday to Thursday and pm on a Friday and Saturday.After a - vote back in April, the licensing board narrowly paved the way for the pub’s opening last month despite BrewDog not possessing a provisional licence.It took the highly unusual step of granting two occasional licences to enable it to trade from the former Mitchell’s Dairy premises on Market Street.BrewDog retail director James Brown told the board the firm had made “a huge commitment to Inverurie and Aberdeenshire” and afterwards said he was “delighted” with the decision.Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing, stressed at the time that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Peterhead Household Waste and Recycling Centre\"  New measures proposed to increase recycling viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"She said: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.

While some HRCs are licensed to take trade waste, some businesses dispose of or recycle their waste asit was domestic waste, therefore not paying for their commercial waste to be disposed of. As well as taking up space meant for local householders’ recyclable materials and causing congestion at facilities, it also has legal and financial implications. Steps to tackle the issue are being proposed to each of the Council’s Area Committees to allow local councillors to give feedback, prior to final consideration by the Infrastructure Services Committee. It follows agreement on a new waste strategy for the area in January, designed to push up recycling rates and send less materials to landfill. Currently, as much as % of the waste taken to recycling centres is thought to be business waste, which should not be there.Disposal of business waste by these means is thought to be costing Aberdeenshire taxpayers around £, a year – money which could be better spent improving recycling services for households. Businesses would be prevented from using HRCs and instead directed to use council waste transfer stations at Banchory, Ellon and Macduff.At these facilities materials can be accurately weighed and charged for appropriately. As it is around half the cost to recycle materials than to landfill them, this gives businesses an incentive to consider which materials have the potential to be erted from landfill.This approach would also make it fairer to those businesses which already dispose of their waste through a paid-for collection service or by paying for the waste they take to recycling centres. To try to ensure businesses cannot continue to use HRCs unlawfully, a vehicle permit system is being proposed. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Staff from Johnston Carmichael at the Aberdeen Kiltwalk\"  Firm goes extra mile for charities viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses would not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailers and vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Under the proposals householders who use commercial type vehicleswould be able to apply for free permits to access HRCs. Households would apply for the free permits in advance and a year’s supplywould be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “The majority of households will not be affected by the proposed permit system as those using cars, MPVs, xs or hire vans would continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.“The permit system is simply designed to address the fact that some households use commercial type vehicles – we understand this and they will be able to use the services in the same way as other members of their community, with a permit which shows staff they are entitled. “In the past we have seen situations where staff are put in a dficult position where they suspect someone disposing of materials at an HRC is linked to a business but cannot prove this. “The permit system will avoid any confusion and will make it perfectly clear that only household materials are permitted to be disposed of at our HRCs.“It is also really important that businesses take disposal costs into account when charging for work, paying appropriately for the waste they create. Following recent public engagement on budget setting, we know many residents agree with this approach that the council should not subsidise businesses. It is not for the taxpayer to pick up this bill on their behalf, hence these proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"poppy scotland s bud visits meldrum pupils","story":"Poppy Scotland#s travelling education vehicle, Bud, visited Meldrum Academy last week.Pupils in S and S had the opportunity to step inside the special vehicle so that they could learn more about the charity and the work it does.The Bud vehicle is interactive, giving pupils the chance to watch videos and they also had a go at making their own poppy.Bud aims to teach pupils about the Lady Haig Poppy Factory and showcases ious items from the Poppy Scotland archive including poppies from across the world.The academy was one of the few schools chosen in Aberdeenshire to get a visit from Bud thanks to the work of one of its pupils.S pupil Anna Jackson was a finalist in Poppy Scotland’s ‘Breaking News, War is Over’ competition.Meldrum Academy had five entries and Anna was selected as one of three finalists.She created her own newspaper, with the leading story announcing that war was over.Anna said: “I did research for it on the internet and I stained it with tea to make it look like it was from that time.“I was excited to make it to the finals.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The network spans  countries from Russia to Ireland and from Norway to Malta.There were representatives of  countries at the meeting, hosted by Za Zamiata, Friends of the Earth Bulgaria.As well as discussing bylaws and agreeing budgets, we visited Kresna Gorge, a lovely km river canyon which is Bulgaria’s top hotspot for nature and is a gateway to the Pirin National Park, a Unesco World Heritage site.The gorge is host to  protected species, including bears, wolves and two sorts of tortoise, and provides a safe corridor for wildle to travel through this part of Bulgaria, including migrating Egyptian vultures.It is said that more butterflies live in one square kilometre of the Kresna Gorge than in the whole of the UK.The main road to Greece goes through the gorge. Traffic on the road has tripled in the last  years.The Bulgarian government had agreed to build a new motorway in a tunnel, to avoid trashing the gorge, but the plan has changed to building a full on motorway.This has received half a billion euros of European funding despite the gorge and its species supposedly being protected by European nature laws.The motorway would massively increase traffic flow, change the character of the gorge completely where section of the walls were removed to allow for a straighter road, destroy most of the best agricultural land and risk serious water pollution from road runoff in all seasons and salting operations in the winter.We visited the Kresna Gorge to hang a giant campaign banner from one of the bridges over the Struma River.The story featured on three Bulgarian TV stations, including a live interview from the protest.There are , signatures on a petition to save Kresna Gorge and we went to Kresna village to hear from a range of local campaigners.One man told us of his distress over the years as the traffic built up and more and more wild animals were killed on the road.Now, he says, there is very little roadkill because populations have been reduced so severely.We also heard from a representative of the rafting industry, which brings tens of thousands people to the area every year. They are all clear that they want the existing road to remain for local access and the previously-promised motorway in a tunnel to take the long distance traffic.The local campaigners made accusations of corruption, with sections of the road starting construction even before the tendering process was completed.Repeated appeals to the European Commission to intervene to protect nature have been met with silence.With tremendously fortuitous timing, as we were standing in the village square meeting the locals, we got the very welcome news that the Welsh government had turned down the M relief road, which has been debated for at least  years and would have severely damaged the sensitive Gwent Levels coastal wetlands.As you can imagine, there was a heart-felt cheer in Kresna at this news. Wales declared a Climate Emergency shortly after Scotland did in April and this was the first big test of whether they are serious. They have passed that test and in doing so given renewed hope to people , miles away, at the opposite end of Europe.l Dr Richard Dixon is director of Friends of the Earth Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment time for the bbc to get priorities right","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Broadcaster should think again about decision to scrap free licences for the over s.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"total rematch for a night in november","story":"AUGUST  and the curtain came up on Marie Jones’ A Night in November, making its theatrical debut as part of Féile an Phobail.  years on and the play is back, detailing one man’s struggle with identity at the Lyric Theatre.The play charts the story of welfare clerk Kenneth McAllister, a Protestant who has always followed the rules and has “cleanly discriminated” against Catholics throughout his le. This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion.

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily.

Antrimrsquos expected fightback started immediately with the accurate Katie McAleese keeping her side in contention with five consecutive points, including three from play.There was only a point in it as the first half drew to a close, but Down broke free from their shackles and Mallon sent her side into the break with a - to - lead with a well-taken score.Antrim reduced the leeway to a single point at the start of the second half with a score from Bronagh Orchin, but a composed Down side replied with a brace from Mallon as the Mourne girls took a - to - lead after  minutes.McAleese and Paula OrsquoHagan swapped points before Down hit the jackpot when Sara Louise Carr found the back of the Antrim net for Downrsquos second goal and a six point lead with  minutes remaining.Full credit to Antrim, they refused to throw in the towel and three unanswered points from Maeve Kelly and McAleeseleft a puck of the ball between the sides.It was a hammer and tongs finish with both sides feeling the pressure, but it was Downrsquos Niamh Mallon who settled the issue with a converted free and give her side a deserved victory.Down captain Fionnuala Carr was delighted after her sidersquos victory and it marked a successful season on both the club and county front for her after she also lted the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Camogie title with Clonduff in March.ldquoThere are a few of us that played for Down for many years and couldnrsquot win an Ulster senior.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle. The mistake led to angry words at Down Council where officials were blamed for not supervising the work and inspecting the completed job.However, Enterprise Ulster workmen responded quickly to a council call and within days had put things right.SHRIGLEY mdash A new factory in Shrigley, which will manufacture plastic products and employ  people, is expected to open within the next few months.The factory is sited in premises vacated by the tannery at Shrigley and the man behind the venture is Mr Garfield Brown, who already owns the Killyleagh Rug Company.It is not exactly clear when the new firm will open, but itrsquos managing director, Mr Lance Walker, says he is optimistic that production will start in August.He said the factory will carry out plastic processing and will provide materials for the packaging industry. ldquoObviously we want to start as soon as possible, but at the moment machinery is being delivered and we are waiting for more to arrive.

The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing.

We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17680641.a-happy-and-quiet-life-of-101-year-old-who-wanted-no-fuss/resources/images/9967347.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business students","story":"Final year business students from South West College studying BTEC Level  Diploma in Business completed their final pitches last week in front of a  of lsquoDragonsrsquo.A Dragonsrsquo Den simulated task was the concluding element of a yearlong project that required them to develop inidual business ideas, conduct market research, and compose financial forecasts.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

Not when you have thousands and thousands of cars having to take the MOT.“Since the big  crash people are holding on to their cars longer. People don’t have the money they had before.“People who might have decided to just go and buy a new car when the MOT was up are deciding to hold on to the car they have instead. And cars are lasting longer.”The Belfast-based businessman believes the Department of Infrastructure should also issue exemptions for drivers whose cars are “roadworthy” but are unable to secure a test due to the backlog.“The waiting times are a joke – opening on Sundays is not going to get rid of the backlog.”He added: “What’s going to happen come January when there’s another , or so cars due for their first MOT  They need to take another look at exemptions.”Last week, the department said it was “reviewing the current legislation to determine under what circumstances a temporary exemption may be issued”.The News Letter has requested an update on that review.Ambulance, police and paramedics at ‘medical incident’ on major N.I. road Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The PSNI, meanwhile, has said previously that it is in “discussions” with the Driver and Vehicle Agency about whether officers should exercise “discretion” for drivers impacted by the long waiting times.This week a PSNI spokesperson said: “Police would urge anyone receiving theirletter to act upon it immediately and,you didn’t get a letter, make sure your vehicle is properly registered with DVLA.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
