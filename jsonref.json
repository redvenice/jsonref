Such naivety dates all the way back to 1994 – when changes to the UK\u0027s investor visa scheme allowed holders to smoothly turn them into British passports, with all the rights those precious documents entail, including the ability to make legal donations to political parties.In no uncertain terms, the report sharply concludes that \u0027the key to London\u0027s appeal was the exploitation\u0027 of this scheme.But that was just the first in a string of blunders. Indeed, the ISC damningly recalls its previous warnings to the Government, pointedly quoting anonymous spymasters who sheepishly claimed their focus on counter-terrorism took priority.As for the notion that Russia might dare to attack our political system, the report reveals it was barely considered – as demonstrated by the fact that MI5 replied to the committee with only six lines of text on that matter. That was enough for the committee to note there was \u0027credible\u0027 evidence of Russian influence during the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. Yet the clueless Clouseaus of MI5 apparently thought this and any other suggestion of Russian mischief was not worth investigating. On cyber-warfare, the ISC notes with shock, nobody appears to be in charge.With concern dripping from every page, it\u0027s hardly surprising the report poses more questions than it answers.It however makes immediate recommendations that will directly affect the security of all of us. It confirms that the outdated Official Secrets Act of 1989 needs to be replaced with a new system that ensure the registration of those who peddle political influence on behalf of foreign powers. The Computer Misuse Act of 1990 is similarly obsolete, predating the era of mobile phones. Another much-needed recommendation is for a thorough investigation of Russian meddling in our political system. As the report highlights, the authorities have been scandalously incurious about this.Why does GCHQ, it asks, not look at who lies behind the Twitter accounts that peddle hoaxes and scare stories.Of course, it does seem that our intelligence services have belatedly turned their attention to online political manipulation – as demonstrated by some tantalising asterisks, reflecting redaction of secret material – scattered throughout the section of the report dedicated to it.But it is all too little, and shamefully late. As for the report\u0027s calls for further investigation into pernicious Russian influence, I fear that there is little prospect of the report\u0027s forceful conclusions being matched with real action.Take the committee\u0027s alarm at Kremlin\u0027s pinstriped accomplices – the bankers, lawyers and accountants whom it calls unwitting or even witting agents of Russian influence.Dealing with such rot in our system will need new legislation and a revamped National Crime Agency. Even if that were possible, we cannot ignore the fact that it may be too late already.To put it bluntly, our country is afloat on a sea of dodgy money. And the bitter truth is that this is our fault.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye doesnt trust Kim anymore tried doctors lock up","story":"Share this articleKim Kardashian ¿demands troubled husband Kanye West drop out of presidential race immediately¿ or she ¿may orce him¿ ¿ The SunKim Kardashian Completely Devastated After Kanye West Claims She and Kris Jenner Tried to \u0027Lock Me Up\u0027 | Entertainment TonightKanye West is holed up in ¿super secure¿ bunker at Wyoming ranch and ¿doesn¿t trust¿ wife Kim Kardashian or her familyKim and Kanye\u0027s marriage may not survive rapper\u0027s latest episodeKanye West\u0027s presidential campaign, album release are \u0027perfect timing,\u0027 PR experts say | Fox News"},{"url":null,"title":"Tesco staff told clean toilets shelves floors","story":"Share this articleTesco staff in nearly 2,000 stores to clean shops after contractors axed | Tesco | The Guardian"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76e78c7bf9af262320df2ddbffa8978f858d84a3/0_79_2362_1418/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e6ee4632800fa64b983fc36421f67ac","title":"great british art quiz arts council collection","story":"The Arts Council Collection set today’s quiz, which enables explores the collection of British museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questionsThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Yes, they are putting lives in danger. But do they deserve to be vilified? NoCostco Karen Walmart Karen Starbucks Karen Target Karen. Name a US retail establishment and there’s probably a viral video of a “Karen” (internet slang for an angry white woman) fuming about face masks in it or getting chased out of the store for refusing to wear one. “Mask meltdown” videos have become a feature of the pandemic, part of a larger trend of mask-shaming. Sneering at people who refuse to wear face coverings has become a particularly viral form of virtue signalling.Britain is a few months behind parts of the US in terms of masks. In New York, where I live, they’ve been compulsory in most public places since April. But with face coverings becoming mandatory for English shoppers this week (and already compulsory in Scotland) I’m sure it won’t be long before mask-shaming is as rampant in the UK as it is over here.Yes, people who refuse to wear face masks are selfish. Yes, they’re putting lives in danger. But do they deserve to be vilified and publicly shamed? I don’t think so. Not just because public shaming is often ineffective but because they’re not the biggest villains here: the people who truly deserve our anger are the public figures and authorities – everyone from the US’s surgeon general to representatives of the World Health Organization – who, until fairly recently, told us that masks were useless if not dangerous, before doing a U-turn and insisting we all wear one.The most generous assessment of the rapidly changing guidelines around mask wearing is that experts have adapted their views as new evidence emerges. But there’s also plenty of evidence that experts have simply lied to us. The French doctor and TV personality Marina Carrère d’Encausse has said that her government’s early insistence that masks weren’t necessary was a “lie” told “for a good cause” to ensure health workers wouldn’t run out. In the US, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said the same thing. Meanwhile, the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, just says whatever he reckons will play best at that particular moment. It still boggles my mind that he blithely dismissed masks as just “extra insurance” on a Monday and then announced the next day that they would be mandatory in shops and enforced with fines. And you wonder why people don’t trust experts or the government? Aggggg! Hear that? It’s the muffled sound of me screaming into the void through my face mask."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bdfbecb070a9548090ad4a9021cb9909e39f411/0_67_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=274220ede4576e490c5d231a23fd57f9","title":"greta thunberg says eu recovery plans climate provisions inadequate","story":"Exclusive: Activist says €750bn fund shows leaders not treating global heating as emergencyGreta Thunberg has accused EU politicians of failing to acknowledge the scale of the climate crisis and said its €750bn Covid-19 recovery plan does not do enough to tackle the issue.The climate campaigner said the package of measures agreed by EU leaders proved that politicians were still not treating climate change as an emergency.“They are still denying the fact and ignoring the fact that we are facing a climate emergency, and the climate crisis has still not once been treated as a crisis,” Thunberg told the . “As long as the climate crisis is not being treated as a crisis, the changes that are necessary will not happen.”Thunberg, 17, and other leaders of the school strikes movement across Europe said the package was inadequate.Luisa Neubauer, 24, a central figure in Germany’s school strikes movement, said young people were becoming increasingly frustrated with politicians.“We are asking our leaders to take care of the most fundamental thing: the safety of us, the safety of people around the world, the safety of our futures,” Neubauer said. “It is worrying on a democratic level when you ask for such substantial things, which seem so obvious, and yet you see how leaders are widely ignoring it, or not considering it to be as important as other things.”Another prominent school striker, Adélaïde Charlier, 19, from Belgium, said politicians who adopted the language of climate action without following up with urgent policy measures were worse than climate deniers.“When leaders minimise the climate crisis, I feel it is more dangerous than leaders that outright deny it … because then we actually feel we can rely on them and we are actually on the right path and that is dangerous and wrong.”The group has written an open letter to EU leaders demanding they act immediately to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis.The letter, signed by 80,000 people including some of the world’s leading scientists, argues that the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that most leaders are able to act swiftly and decisively when they deem it necessary, but that the same urgency has been missing in the response to climate change.“It is now clearer than ever that the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, neither from the politicians, media, business nor finance. And the longer we keep pretending that we are on a reliable path to lower emissions and that the actions required to avoid a climate disaster are available within today’s system … the more precious time we will lose,” it says.The letter argues that the climate and ecological emergency can only be addressed by tackling the underlying “social and racial injustices and oppression that have laid the foundations of our modern world”.Earlier this year the EU unveiled its green new deal proposals, which it said aimed to transform the bloc from a high- to a low-carbon economy without reducing prosperity and while improving people’s quality of life. The climate strikers dismissed the EU’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 as dangerously unambitious.Thunberg, who this week was awarded Portugal’s Gulbenkian prize for humanity and pledged the €1m ($1.15m) award to groups working to protect the environment and halt climate change, said it was up to ordinary people to stand up and demand that politicians rise to the challenge.“I see the hope in democracy and in people,” she said. “If people become aware of what is happening then we can accomplish anything, we can put pressure on people in power … if we just decide we have had enough then that will change everything.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ff91bdaca35d01e76c92b1620bf54dd1c4a7be/193_666_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9019cad7f8d7a4e17f4995e8c91ae102","title":"specieswatch hedgehogs are well loved but mysterious garden visitors","story":"We know so little about the lives of these endearing animals, whose numbers are in decline in BritainThe European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, is said to be the gardener’s best friend eating slugs, beetles and other unwelcome visitors to the vegetable patch.

Conservation groups are trying to create suitable places for hedgehogs to thrive, such as collections of urban gardens and less manicured parks.Surprisingly for such a well-loved animal, details of the hedgehog’s life are little known – even whether they have one or two sets of up to five hoglets each year is not certain.

Decarbonising heat is the biggest energy challenge in tackling the climate emergency, particularly because it requires action in millions of inidual homes. Currently, just 1m of the UK’s 27m homes have low-carbon heat.The government’s current policy is to ban gas boilers only from 2025 in newly built homes. But the group said taking action to transform the UK’s heating would create 150,000 jobs and help the nation recover from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Karan Bilimoria, the CBI president and chair of the heat commission, said “A green recovery and progress towards the UK’s net zero emission target are doomed to fail if we don’t address the urgent need to decarbonise the heat in our homes and buildings.Prof Martin Freer at the University of Birmingham and part of the commission said: “Delivering decarbonisation of heating is the biggest energy challenge we face in getting to net zero. Unlike electricity, which can be changed at a systems level, it requires over 20m households to adopt new energy efficiency measures and new ways of generating heat.”The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. The commission members included business leaders from National Grid, UK Energy Research Centre and Cadent, the UK’s largest gas distribution network.The commission report says: “This transition will undoubtedly be disruptive to consumers and businesses.”The new types of heating systems will be more expensive until providers scale-up their production. Lord Bilimoria said: “We do recognise the upfront costs and we don’t think these should be borne by the consumer alone.”The commission said the government had a “pivotal role” to play, which required “political courage and vision” and the creation of a national delivery body for heat, modelled on the organisation that delivered the 2012 Olympics.He said the CCC would publish new advice for government this year, including the critical steps needed to decarbonise UK homes.The commission report says oil-fired boilers are particularly polluting and should be banned from 2023. The alternative to conventional boilers include heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground or air and, as a stopgap to 2035, hybrid systems that combine gas and heat pumps.Installation of heat pumps in homes by Wealden district council led to an average saving of £500 a year for tenants, the commission found. Hydrogen boilers produce only water when burning the fuel, which could be created by renewable energy in the future.The commission said a vital step in installing the new systems was to reduce heating needs by increasing building energy efficiency. Part of the funding needed for this could come from reforming the £2bn-a-year winter fuel payment currently paid to over-65s to target the money at those most in need.The UK will host a critical UN climate meeting in 2021, and Bilimoria said the country could show its leadership on the world stage by implementing the heat commission’s recommendations.The government has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37125a0fbdc6f8417e4bf07d7754817a34f47ca/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67562d4489c62b7b7e9533cddd01dbdf","title":"first active leak of sea bed methane discovered in antarctica","story":"Researchers say potent climate-heating gas almost certainly escaping into atmosphereThe first active leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica has been revealed by scientists.The researchers also found microbes that normally consume the potent greenhouse gas before it reaches the atmosphere had only arrived in small numbers after five years, allowing the gas to escape.Vast quantities of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica. The gas could start to leak as the climate crisis warms the oceans, a prospect the researchers said was “incredibly concerning”.The reason for the emergence of the new seep remains a mystery, but it is probably not global heating, as the Ross Sea where it was found has yet to warm significantly. The research also has significance for climate models, which currently do not account for a delay in the microbial consumption of escaping methane.The active seep was first spotted by chance by ers in 2011, but it took scientists until 2016 to return to the site and study it in detail, before beginning laboratory work.The release of methane from frozen underwater stores or permafrost regions is one of the key tipping points that scientists are concerned about, which occur when a particular impact of global heating becomes unstoppable.“The methane cycle is absolutely something that we as a society need to be concerned about,” said Thurber. “I find it incredibly concerning.”Very little was known about the Antarctic methane cycle but the good news, he said, was that the new seep provided a natural laboratory for further research.Why the new seep formed is unknown. “That is a mystery that we still do not have an answer to,” Thurber said. “It is on the side of an active volcano but it doesn’t seem like it came from that.”Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved in the study, said: “Antarctica and its ice sheet are huge black holes in our understanding of Earth’s methane cycle – they are difficult places to work.The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, reports the discovery of the methane seep at a 10-metre (30ft) deep site known as Cinder Cones in McMurdo Sound. It is a 70-metre long patch of white microbial mats, and a second seep was found during the 2016 expedition.“We stumbled upon the methane seep at a site that has been ed at since the 1960s and it had just turned on,” said Thurber. There were no bubbles of methane, he said. “Most of the methane in many seeps actually comes out in what we call diffuse flows. So it’s just dissolved in the water.”The source of the methane is probably decaying algae deposits buried under sediments and is likely to be thousands of years old. In most parts of the oceans, methane leaking from the sea bed is consumed by microbes in the sediment or the water column above. But the slow growth of microbes at the Cinder Cones site, and its shallow depth, means methane is almost certain to be leaking into the atmosphere.Thurber said the first microbes to grow at the site were of an unexpected strain. “We’re probably in a successional stage, where it may be five to 10 years before a community becomes fully adapted and starts consuming methane.”Widespread active methane seepage was reported off the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia in 2014, a first for the Southern Ocean. “But that’s really a different oceanographic area than the Antarctic continent,” Thurber said.Wadham said the five years for which the Cinder Cones seep has been studied is a short amount of time. “So it would be good to see what happens to this seep into the future. The discovery also makes you wonder if these features are more common than we might think around Antarctica, but are rarely stumbled upon.”However, the researchers are unlikely to be able to return to Antarctica soon. The continent is currently free of coronavirus but the risk of infection has disrupted expedition plans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c7a63ce62f3c3fb2b551e7dd13f1f0af6099251/0_285_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f4e8dee4f52c4e2303fc751784fa86","title":"as tenet is delayed yet again is it time to end cinemas america first policy","story":"The release of Christopher Nolan’s thriller has been paused indefinitely while the US wrestles with Covid-19. But why should the rest of the world have to wait?Growing up in the 1980s, there was always one classmate who would go to the US for the summer holidays and come back raving about new movies such as ET: The Extra-Terrestrial or Ghostbusters. Us Brits would then have to wait until Christmas to see them, by which time our expectations had become so over-inflated the movies rarely lived up to them (sacrilege I know, but Ghostbusters was way better in my head). In movie terms, going to the US was like visiting the future. Now, though, the situation has practically reversed.In recent decades, the time delay has narrowed to the extent that most big movies now come out on the same day, or at least within weeks, everywhere from LA to Lima. However, Covid-19 has created a further complication: most of Europe, Oceania and east Asia has been getting on top of the pandemic. The US has not. So while cinemas are tentatively reopening around the world, they remain almost entirely shuttered in key markets such as California, Texas, Florida and New York.Consequently, all those tentpole movies that Hollywood has been dangling before us all year are being snatched away again. Christopher Nolan’s Tenet, now the standard-bearer for the global cinema restart, has already moved back twice from its original early July release. Now Warner Brothers tells us Tenet has been delayed indefinitely. Other big releases, such as Disney’s Mulan, are likely to follow suit.Non-Hollywood alternatives are available, of course, but cinemas around the world are currently drumming their fingers, waiting for the US to get its pandemic under control so they can get some new movies to put on. Given the competence of those in command, that could take some time. According to experts, US cinemas will not reopen in earnest until September at the earliest. But never mind “How long can we wait?”, the question now is: “Why should we wait?” Why can’t the rest of us see Tenet and Mulan now? The US can just wait till Christmas, like we had to with ET and Ghostbusters.Is there an element of national pride here? One possible response from Hollywood would be: “Because they’re our movies (even the ones we make in the UK for the tax breaks).” The rest of the world seeing its movies first could be taken as another symptom of the US’s decline as the global superpower. But Warners’ chairman recently stated that Tenet is no longer being treated like a “traditional global day-and-date release”, which suggests they are prepared to release it in other territories before the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5de2539b8866dd724d75cbde40482674f4fffbd/0_1873_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad15a0aaf924ddbc47d25d0b7bc8e8b8","title":"forget chocolate chip 20 delicious cookie recipes from custard yo yos to a tiramisu sandwich","story":"From cookies masquerading as seashells to multicoloured pinwheels and salty savouries, there is something here for everyoneBiscuits – like so much of life post-lockdown – may never be the same again.

If you are after something a little more grownup, date and tahini cookies hit a similar spot, as do these chocolate and pistachio cookies.Somewhere between a dunkable biscuit and a Dunkin’ donut, stuffed cookies offer plenty of potential for surprise. Nutella is the go-to, but it is not exactly adventurous. Why not stuff red velvet cookies with cream cheese or, if that sounds a little too cake-like, try marzipan-stuffed almond sugar cookies? For the die-hard biscuit fan, follow the Bosh! recipe for cookies stuffed with yet more cookies (it has opted for Oreos).Not to be confused with stuffed cookies, as detailed above, sandwich cookies are a different means of getting more bang for your biscuit. Prue Leith’s tiramisu sandwich biscuits have a dessert-like quality, while Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh’s custard yo-yos with roasted rhubarb icing offer a sophisticated take on a childhood classic, and Jeremy Lee’s shortcake sandwiches are filled with a combination of lemon curd, goat’s curd and marmalade. You might need a fork for that last one.An easy win if aesthetics are your thing: the spiral effect is created by layering two or more batches of cookie dough – ideally in contrasting colours – then rolling into a log, before slicing and baking. Candy cane-coloured Christmas iterations have an hypnotic appeal – this recipe adds extra dazzle by covering the outer layer in sprinkles – but they are not necessarily the most flavourful. Chocolate and mint pinwheels offer a little more oomph, as do Martha Stewart’s chewy coconut-chocolate creations.For cookies to feel truly contrary, ditch the sugar and make them savoury. Avoid veering into cracker territory by keeping biscuits thick and crumbly parmesan shortbread with fennel and sea salt wouldn’t be out of place on a cheeseboard, but it also pairs well with a cocktail. These manchego and chorizo melting biscuits are incredibly straightforward to make but, if you’re not keen on cheese, go heavy on the herbs instead – see David Lebovitz’s rosemary cookies with tomato jam.At the other end of the spectrum, iced cookies are about as sweet as it gets. Hop on the trend for all things tie-dye with tie-dye butter cookies, iced using an innovative “swirl-n-dip method”. For those with a steady hand and artistic inclinations, master cookie decorator Amber Spiegel is a good source of icing inspiration, with tutorials on how to recreate everything from seashell cookies (sand included) to an April Fools’ Day dinner cookie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecdcb640bcaedb4a8be77f5ba0c0a4ed39f98461/0_1198_5485_3291/master/5485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ddb9155a2d94834b818d1721396c33e","title":"nigel slater recipe bulgur with roasted summer vegetables","story":"Plump juicy grains with carrots, fennel, onions and herbsSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.

His tip? Don’t scrimp. “Buy a bar that you love, whether it’s single origin, blended, Bournville or flavoured, like chocolate orange,” he says, which he then chops into chunks of varying sizes. Goh agrees: “It’s nice to have irregular bits of chocolate, so you’ve got shards and fine, powdery bits marbled through the dough.” She suggests mixing milk and dark for contrast, while Lamb ups the ante by sticking a chocolate feves (disc) on top of each cookie, guaranteeing “a beautiful big chocolate chip” for all.So far, so simple. However, the cracks appear at the question of resting and baking. Flora Shedden, owner of Aran bakery in Highland Perthshire, chills her dough for at least half an hour, Young freezes his for 20 minutes, to keep the middles cold (“There’s more chance of it being gooey that way”), while Goh and Feast’s own Tamal Ray bake it straight away. For Lamb, however, resting overnight (aka four to eight hours) is key: “It allows you to get that thickness. If you put them straight in the oven, everything spreads out.”Ovens are notoriously unreliable, so get to know yours. Lamb goes big, baking 75g balls of dough at 170C for 10 minutes: “They should be puffed up, and when you take them out and cool, they will almost deflate, and that’s when you get that crackly top.” But stay alert. “Undercook your cookies,” warns Shedden, who removes hers “when they’re still looking slightly raw in the middle” for peak chewiness. To be safe, make like Ray, who bakes a “test cookie” first, removing it when it starts browning at the edges.Once you’ve cracked your base recipe, nuts (cashews and pecans), spices (Goh uses cinnamon, nutmeg or cardamom), rye or buckwheat flour, chopped chewy caramel (Ray’s favourite) or sourdough starter are all good additions. Shedden uses oats, to aid chewiness (you use less flour), while Young goes for the double with the cookie sandwich, filling it with Nutella (other brands are available), buttercream, mashed banana or toasted marshmallows. Lamb uses the latter to make “a filthy cookie” with brown butter, caramelised white chocolate and walnuts. “If I’m going to change it up, then I normally do something really silly, something that makes people smile, because that’s what cookies are about.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Is this a record in a professional domestic league game?” asks George Jones.Wigan’s extraordinary romp had everyone scrambling round the memory bank andor the nearest Rothmans. The ambiguity of the above question meant a few of you sent in examples of crazy scoring in the second half of games, so let’s deal with those first.“Brighton beat Walsall 7-0 in 1976, having been goalless at half-time,” notes Roger Kay. “Peter Ward got four and Ian ‘Spider’ Mellor three. It was a little ironic as we’d been royally whupped by Walsall 6-0 only two years previously.”Radu Ogrezeanu-Ghica can see Brighton’s performance and raise it: he highlights Borussia Dortmund’s 11-1 Bundesliga shellacking of Arminia Bielefeld in 1982. It was 1-1 at half-time before Dortmund edged to victory with 10 unanswered goals in the second half.Matches are more likely to open up after half-time, so to win the first half 7-0 is even less likely. Wigan are not the first team to achieve this magnificent feat, however. Huw Richards and Graeme Atkinson point out that Newcastle led Newport 7-0 at half-time of their Division Two game in 1946-47, eventually going on to win 13-0. “Tranmere led Oldham 8-1 at the break on Boxing Day 1935,” adds Graham, “and went on to win 13-4 with Bunny Bell famously grabbing nine (and missing a penalty!).”There’s one more for the list. “On 10 January 1970 Bury beat Tranmere Rovers 8-0,” writes Norman Shuttleworth. “At the time we were playing in an amateur match directly across Manchester Road from the ground. Our second half coincided with the start of the league match. We struggled to count the roars coming out of Gigg Lane, but the general consensus was seven. After our game finished, we snuck in after half-time in anticipation of double figures, only to view a single goal. Can’t remember the result of our match.”While it was not a league game, this Knowledge favourite saw Australia 16-0 up at half-time against American Samoa. And in terms of most goals in a half, well …“Mike Dunn’s question in last week’s archive regarding the hottest ever English league or cup game on record reminded me of the opening weekend of the 2003-04 Football League season (when I ‘enjoyed’ Forest’s 2-0 win over Sunderland at the City Ground in 30°C-plus weather),” begins Graeme Atkinson.“The UK temperature record was set on the Sunday (10 August – 38.5°C in Faversham, Kent, which was only broken in July 2019),” continues Graeme. “Unfortunately there were no league or cup games played in England or Wales apart from the Community Shield between Manchester United and Arsenal in chilly Cardiff, which was only 25°C or so according to the Met Office.“There was, however, a full programme of Football League games on Saturday 9 August and the link above shows London as the hottest part of the country that day, with an isotherm of 34°C corresponding roughly to the M25 (and recorded temperatures of 36°C at Kew, Greenwich and Enfield).“There were four games played in the capital so all four are probably hot enough to beat Andy Wright’s 1906 answer. My money’s on Loftus Road for the hottest:That Met Office link has confused us, because we’re sure the temperature in Cardiff was in the high thirties during that Community Shield match. Some contemporary reports suggest it was actually 41 degrees at one stage. That figure is supported by post-match quotes from Sir Alex Ferguson, who also said he was “roasting ma totties off”. A video of the game shows a pitchside thermometer with a reading in the high 30s.There are lies, damned lies and temperature readings, so who knows what is absolutely the hottest game ever played in England – or, for that matter, in Britain. But James Wilson has another contender to add to the list. “The on-pitch temperature readings at the Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Falkirk in May 2009 were 37°C,” mails James. “Kris Boyd, up front for Rangers, complained coming down the tunnel at half-time with the score 0-0 that it was ‘too hot for fitba’. Walter Smith duly hooked him for his complaint, replacing him with Nacho Novo. It was an apparently accidental stroke of genius, with Novo scoring a worldie with about his third touch.”“With one game to go, none of the big three Istanbul teams – Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas – occupy the top three places in the Turkish Super Lig. Has the season ever finished without one of those teams in the top three?” wonders Grant Ninnes.The short answer is “no”, Grant. The Super Lig started in 1959, and since then at least one of the three big Istanbul clubs has always finished in the top three. And usually in the top one: between them they have won 54 of the 62 Super Lig titles. But this year’s champions are Istanbul Basaksehir, for the first time in their history, and only Besiktas can still finish in the top three.Besiktas need to win their last game at Genclerbirligi on Sunday and hope Sivasspor fail to beat Goztepe. It’s an important game, and not just for anorak purposes – the team that finishes third will enter the Champions League qualifying round.“I was at the Amsterdam ArenA to see Ajax batter Sparta Rotterdam 5-2,” wrote Federico Tessadori in July 2007. “It occurred to me then that Ajax are is the only team I know with their sponsor (ABN Amro) written vertically on their shirt, and not even in the middle! Do any other teams have such extravagant sponsor placing?”“Ireland’s Wexford Youths (the name is a nod to Juventus) have a similarly jauntily positioned sponsorship,” explained Sean DeLoughry. “The club is owned, sponsored and indeed managed by building magnate and football enthusiast Mick Wallace. Their jersey is emblazoned with their ownersponsormanager’s name WALLACE, vertically down the jersey.”“Stockport County have just signed Connor and James Jennings, from different clubs. They are brothers. Have there been many other clubs who have done the same?” asks Dan Levy.“Mitigating circumstances, obviously, but this season has seen the champions of each of England’s four isions crowned ‘without kicking a ball’: Liverpool via Manchester City losing to Chelsea, Leeds via Brentford’s defeat to Stoke, and Leagues One and Two settled earlyon PPG. No team won their league while actually being on the pitch themselves. Has this ever happened across all four isions in the same season before?” muses Sam Coare.• Send your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2ade181103a8fc5fa33500655aeb58d42284e79/1269_230_4244_2545/master/4244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a170ce8862abc172b91abe8d6f59e46","title":"coronavirus ruined everything the long wait for new limbs in kurdistan","story":"Decades of war have resulted in a high demand for prosthetics – and patients are anxious to visit clinics as they finally reopenConcentration is etched on Hussein’s face as he walks along a scuffed yellow line painted on the floor of the clinic’s rehabilitation room. He’s getting a feel for his new prosthetic.Hussein lost his left leg below the knee in 1987 when he stepped on a landmine while fishing at Lake Dukan, around 100km (62 miles) east of Erbil in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq. Mines and other unexploded remnants of successive wars litter the landscape, causing new injuries every year. More than half the clinic’s 15,100 patients are amputees. Roughly 4,600 of them lost limbs as a result of conflict – 2,500 of these to landmines.Hussein’s new leg had been gathering dust in the clinic’s storeroom since Covid-19 lockdown measures were introduced on 11 March, and the clinic was forced to close.Following decades of violence, Iraq has one of the largest populations with disabilities in the world. Although the governments in Baghdad and Erbil have passed legislation designed to protect the rights of people with disabilities, and challenge deep-seated social stigma, implementation has been slow. Family shame keeps many people hidden from public view, while access to healthcare and rehabilitation, education, training and employment remain limited.The coronavirus pandemic is adding to the problems.“Even if you don’t have the illness, you’re worried. Since it began, people don’t want to go outside and meet others and their livelihoods are not doing well,” says Hussein, who receives around 140,000 IQD (about £93) a month from the government to supplement any additional income.Sardar Kadeer Seeda, a prosthetic and orthotic technician, says people can’t afford to stay away from the clinic. “Especially for amputees, if the prosthesis is broken, he cannot do anything at home or at work. So it’s an emergency. It’s necessary for his life. For his social life,” he says. “They want to come to the centre. They are not afraid. It’s a higher priority than the virus.”As of 16 July, over 10,000 Covid-19 cases and 370 deaths had been recorded in Kurdistan – relatively low compared to Iraq as a whole, where, according to the WHO, there have been more than 90,000 cases confirmed and more than 3,600 deaths.Work at the clinic, which is run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), came to an abrupt halt when lockdown was announced. All 41 staff were ordered to stay home.Ayman Rahman Abdullkareem, 24, finally managed to get an appointment at the clinic after his original slot was postponed in March. He’s being measured for an ankle-foot orthosis.A stroke last year left Abdullkareem paralysed down his left side. Although many of his motor skills have returned, the loss of sensation in his lower leg has left him with a debilitating foot drop.The university graduate blames his disability for his failure to find work. “No one is hiring me. It’s not because there are no jobs. It’s because, I know, if I am an employer, I would not hire someone with a foot drop,” he says, looking at his feet. He is hopeful the new orthotic, if delivered quickly, will turn his fortunes around.In the clinic’s segregated rehabilitation room for women and girls, Shilan Majeed Saed waits to be fitted for a new leg brace.A major peripheral nerve was severed when a bullet passed through both her legs 11 years ago. Saed’s husband, a Peshmerga soldier, had left his loaded weapon on the sofa in their family home. Unnoticed, it discharged when Saed sat down.“They say that you can’t even get treatment for it in the US. I don’t know if God almighty will heal me or not,” Saed says, seated on an examination table, her swollen toes visible at the hem of her black abaya.Saed has supported her family with a clothing business she set up with a grant from ICRC but lockdown has decimated her customer base. Now she must borrow money to make rent and continue paying the wages of her one employee. She is hoping for another grant to help save her business.“I don’t want to close down. I want to keep working. But when you see that there is no money coming in, you have no other choice,” Saed says. “The coronavirus ruined everything for all of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e0d09b75d1386e4c9b460c625130e2fe8e406db/0_361_6595_3957/master/6595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f645dd3b1dec15b3875f577a1cf85ea","title":"exams that use facial recognition are fair but theyre also intrusive and biased","story":"Although companies behind remote tests say their technology ensures integrity, I’m concerned about privacy and biasAs students sit their exams during the pandemic, universities have turned to digital proctoring services. They range from human monitoring via webcams to remote access software enabling the takeover of a student’s browser. Others use artificial intelligence (AI) to flag body language and background noise that might point to cheating.The companies behind these services say their technology ensures “integrity” in the examination process. The goal is laudable: most people want exams to be run fairly.But at what cost? This is a question that myself and other students of the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) are asking. The BPTC exams, necessary to qualify as a barrister in England and Wales, will be for the first time held with the help of remote proctoring software.The Bar Standards Board (BSB), the regulatory body for barristers, circulated a briefing sheet regarding the exams. The vendor, Pearson Vue, says the software uses “sophisticated security features such as face-matching technology, ID verification, session monitoring, browser lockdown and recordings”.This description raised several red flags: modern face-matching technology uses AI to map facial features from a photograph to compare with another verified image, thereby confirming the two are the same. It is now widely known that AI and algorithms produce biased outcomes, so much so that there have been calls for there to be a moratorium on their use until sufficient safeguards – stricter regulation and ethical standards, for instance – are in place.What to think, then, of remote proctoring systems which bring facial recognition software into our own homes? Beyond the concerns about accuracy, the deployment of these systems in every facet of our lives reinforces the unchecked surveillance and discrimination that have been shown to impact the most vulnerable first. AI and algorithms are one way in which racism can be further embedded into our societies. What makes it more dangerous is the misconception that outcomes produced by technological means are objective or factual, and therefore fair. AI and algorithms are as biased as the developers who make them, and the white-dominated Western tech industry is making software that risks mass discrimination in a neutral disguise.Racial bias is not the only concern. The BSB assures students that the software “complies with the GDPR”, which is good to know given our highly sensitive biometric data, even more sensitive than a fingerprint, will be given to this commercial entity. When the police take a fingerprint, there are safeguards in place to ensure the intrusion is warranted. What are BPTC students suspected of having done to warrant obtaining our faceprint?Remote proctoring has been designed for the BSB’s ideal candidate. This white person passes the facial matching checks without a hitch. They don’t have any of the disabilities the BSB tells us to warn the remote proctor of at the beginning of the exam, in case uncontrolled movements flag suspicion. They have a fast internet connection and no dependants on lockdown who will make noise, or have the cash to hire a socially distanced childminder to watch them. They don’t have noisy pets, or can do as the BSB advises and hire a petsitter. They are not nervous about being monitored throughout the exam by an invisible watcher behind their screen. Oh, and they certainly have a strong bladder, because the system prohibits leaving your computer – for any purpose.We need to take these exams. But the discrimination and intrusion into our private lives is not an acceptable solution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e1017b4ba4f16f0cf4bba13cefc69db1e5eea7/0_364_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d4aee2accd6e298ecad756194875b7e","title":"beyond sourdough the hobbies that helped readers cope with lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions continue to ease,  readers tell us what pastimes and skills they’ve discovered – and rediscovered – during the pandemic During lockdown, my husband and I have taken daily walks in the countryside that have kept us sane and given us a break from the monotony of confinement. Along the way, I have collected stones to paint. Looking for ways to engage the five-year-olds in my class (and missing them a bit too), I painted each stone to look like them and used them to make videos, games and to tell stories. The children loved them and it made some of their lessons a little more meaningful in what has been a challenging time. Anna Clow, 52, early years teacher, Lyon, FranceGrowing vegetables in our suburban front garden has kept us going. A huge laurel tree blocked the light in our front garden so in the first week of lockdown we pulled it down and levelled out the ground. Little did we know, that was the start of a new addiction for propagating and growing vegetables, which now has some dig for England wartime undertones. We have planted broccoli, kale and spinach with squash, tomatoes and chillies waiting indoors to go into a soon-to-be delivered greenhouse. Life in lockdown has been stressful at times, but watching little seedlings emerge has kept us sane. Anna Baatz, 36, charity worker, SalfordI decided that now would be a good time to learn Welsh. I was born in South Wales, but my maternal grandfather was the last in our family to speak the language. In a working-class household, Welsh – be it language or accent – was seen as a barrier to success. I study online for 30 minutes to an hour every day. Having heard the language from an early age, I find the pronunciation relatively easy. I have also discovered the beauty of simple words, not so much their meaning as their sound, the way they flow, and the poetry of remembered rhythms. Roger Moore, 76, retired academic, New Brunswick, CanadaI taught myself how to juggle when I was 13 or 14 and hadn’t thought about it since, but our one-year-old has a little ball pit and one day I picked up three of the balls and tried to juggle to distract her – and I’ve been doing it many times a day ever since. Juggling instantly puts you into a state of flow by taking up almost all of your brain capacity. It’s also perfect for people with a baby. I can do practice sessions of 30 seconds if she is fussy. Plus, she thinks it’s funny. Martin Wilson, 41, instructional designer, SpainA colleague and I were joking about taking up balloon modelling and in the spur of the moment, I ordered some balloons and hit YouTube for inspiration. It’s surprisingly nuanced, and different people have quite distinct styles. I’ve made a monkey up a tree on a desert island, a sloth, lion, tiger, koala, rabbit, bear, flamingo and this morning it was a quizzical mouse sitting on some cheese. There’ve been lots of disasters and exploding body parts, but it keeps me busy in the evenings and gives me somewhere to channel my madness. Sarah, 43, local government worker, ManchesterI had tried (and largely failed) to make pasta from scratch in the past. With restaurants no longer on the menu, I decided to take a more serious stab at it. I still had most of a pre-lockdown bag of 00 flour at the back of my cupboard and, with the help of YouTube, was able to make some much better dough than before – and different shapes, too. Encouraged by my success, I ordered a pasta machine and have been enjoying using it – although I have now run out of flour. Zain Odho, 36, NHS clinical scientist, LondonI passed O level woodwork in 1965 and although I’ve made a few stools since, lockdown has awakened a passion which had gone unrecognised for years. With the help of my best friend giving me 100-year-old oak planks and the gift of a circular saw from my son, I have been producing one piece a week, including three stools, a shelf with an unusual support, and a shoe rack – all done without plans and mainly recycled timber. They will all be gifts for my family. Andy Yates, 70, StockportI’ve toyed with learning for years but when lockdown started I thought I’d finally try to learn the concertina. In my pre-purchasing fantasy, I saw myself practicing diligently for an hour a day but between teaching my school classes online and trying to keep some homeschool structure for my own kids, the hallowed hour has somewhat diminished. But I have learnt to play Silent Night and Happy Birthday, so I’m still quite pleased. Hannah, 40, teacher, BrightonI was in a toy shop with my son before lockdown and picked up a Duncan yoyo. It sat on a shelf until boredom kicked in, and now I can’t put it down. After repeated failures – including one broken string after a particularly vigorous throw – I can now do Round the World, Walk the Dog, the Elevator, Rock the Cradle and the Brain Scrambler. It has taken me back to the joy of a childhood spent playing with real, physical toys, and I have now invested in a new €20 model that will hopefully take my yoyoing to new heights. Mike Warren, 39, Belgooly, IrelandWith time more elastic and ever-hungry kids, I’m travelling the world through pancakes. Flat or folded (Pönnukaka – Iceland), upright or torn (Kaiserschmarrn – Austria), they make excellent use of a potluck larder. Bring on the buckwheat flour for blini (Russian) or stick to spuds with latke (Jewish). Soon I might try cachapas from Venezuela and Colombia, if I can get hold of some maize flour. Sweet or savoury, an elegant treat or an everyday essential, there’s no end to the ways you can eat them. Plus, they’re cheap. Becky Matthewson, writer, KentAfter a few weeks of lockdown I wanted to let some creativity out, so I risked a trip to a local sewing shop and bought a handful of thread. I cut up an old bed sheet and began embroidering with the TV on in the background. It has taken away so much anxiety and given me something relaxing to focus on.

And then we were closed,” said Franzblau, who won’t reopen until a vaccine is made widely available. “It was so quick: here’s our new protocol and then our protocol is we’re closed. It was very intense and very dramatic.”Professional cuddle organizations like Cuddle Sanctuary aim to provide clients with a sense of calm and bliss, thanks in part to the anxiety-reducing hormone oxytocin which is released in response to positive, social touch, like a hug from a friend or a nuzzle from a dog. First popularized in the early 2000s, professional cuddling aimed to fulfill touch needs for a range of clients including survivors of post-traumatic stress disorder and sexual assault and adults on the autistic spectrum. Now, there are dozens of independent professional cuddling organizations, like Portland’s Cuddle Up To Me, and larger networks of professionals like Cuddlist, who have trained hundreds of touch facilitators nationwide.Research has shown that without physical touch, we’re likely to experience loneliness, depression, anxiety disorders and stress. As the pandemic presses on, clients regularly accustomed to getting their touch needs fulfilled by professional cuddlers struggle to find that relief. But professional cuddlers are finding a way to provide an approximate feelgood sensation from afar. Franzblau and some of Cuddle Sanctuary’s professional cuddlers – those who have completed four online courses, including a 12-day training – are offering virtual cuddle sessions on Zoom.Initially, Franzblau was staunchly against the notion of a virtual cuddle. Without skin-on-skin contact, there would be no way for oxytocin to flow. “I was resistant on a very deep level to offer something that I thought would be value-less or seem like snake oil,” she said. However, after consulting with Cuddle Sanctuary professional cuddlers, the group created a format they believed could leave clients feeling good, albeit only with emotional buy-in from both parties. “There are two elements that must be in place: expertise on behalf of the professional and the willingness to try something new on behalf of the client,” Franzblau said. “We must meet each other halfway to make the magic.”Usually, in a one-on-one cuddle session – which ranges from $80 to $100 an hour and is held in a private room either in the client’s home or the cuddler’s workspace – the client and cuddler first go over current stressors and then engage in an open dialogue about where the client wants to be touched. In group sessions which take place at the Sanctuary and last two hours, a professional cuddling facilitator leads attendees through icebreaker and consent exercises, like how to kindly decline an unwanted hug from a peer. Consent is integral and sessions are always fully clothed, no sexual touching allowed.Online, similar communication still has to occur, but in the absence of interpersonal touch, cuddler and client situate themselves in comfortable positions in their homes, visualizing the sensation of being held by another person and massaging themselves.After self-quarantining alone for over a month in New York City, actor and writer Randy Wade Kelley noticed he, like many others, craved human connection. The 37-year-old had never tried professional cuddling in the flesh, but he was introduced to Cuddle Sanctuary through a friend and decided to give the virtual experience a shot in June. A virtual cuddle session, he imagined, would consist of snuggling with pillows and stuffed animals. Instead, he was instructed by Franzblau to recall a pleasant cuddling experience from the past and to lie in a manner that simulated an embrace. Lying on his side, with one arm stretched beneath his head and the other close to his torso, Kelley reveled in his own grasp while Franzblau supervised from nearly 3,000 miles away.After, Kelley said he felt as if he’d spent the week meditating. In the weeks since the virtual cuddle, he’s returned to the side-lounge position as a way of self-placating when he feels lonely. “There’s no substitution for human touch, but it definitely helps bridge the gap,” he said. “I’m so thankful I’m able to cuddle myself.”The client’s openness in learning to self-soothe in the absence of a physical embrace from a professional has been one of the greatest opportunities for growth, said Fei Wyatt, a professional cuddler with Cuddle Sanctuary. “I can’t make them feel something by touching them,” she said. “They have to pay attention to their own body. My clients are being asked to be a lot more aware, pay a lot closer attention and take responsibility for that.”In addition to touch, emotional awareness is integral to the practice of therapeutic cuddling. Asking a stranger to stroke your hair or caress your back requires vulnerability – and in the process, cuddlers and clients build a verbal and physical rapport. In the midst of the pandemic, to compensate for a lack of physical intimacy, Shawn Coleman, a professional cuddler in Chicago, held virtual events promoting emotional togetherness. Inspired by the 36 questions psychologists believe promote feelings of closeness, Coleman hosted nightly Zoom meetings where participants would answer a question a night for 36 days.While Coleman, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, won’t host an in-person cuddle event at least through the end of the year, they see value in reminding clients of the importance of physical and emotional connection. “We can try to get creative during this time in order to find a way to get our needs met,” they said. “For some people, it’s very much around touch, but also for some people it’s not a touch requirement, it’s a connection requirement or an intimacy requirement.”For Teron Mobley, a furloughed restaurant worker in Chicago, virtual cuddle sessions more easily facilitate an emotional bond through meaningful eye contact, something the 35-year-old struggles with in his daily life due to social anxiety, he said. After a year of monthly professional cuddling sessions with Madelon Guinazzo, the co-founder and director of training at Cuddlist, an online directory and training platform for cuddle therapists, Mobley experimented with his first virtual cuddle in early June. Because he can’t currently touch Guinazzo, he built intimacy by gazing into her eyes on his computer screen. “It’s a powerful thing to look into someone’s eyes,” Mobley said. “After that I was like, hmm, actually, this could work. We can’t actually cuddle but it’s some sort of connection.”Mobley is open to another virtual session but eagerly awaits when Guinazzo opens her books for in-person sessions. She has no plans at this time to do so, she said. For both cuddler and client alike, nothing quite compares to the real thing.“It’s like when you’re used to having your favorite meal, let’s say lasagne, and then somebody says here’s a substitute lasagne,” Guinazzo said of the virtual cuddling experience. “It’s OK as long as you’re expecting it not to taste like lasagne.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eca0004c7ff0506ba96cc958f2708900f5839e19/452_67_4917_2951/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840e99965477beca766d5bc46cc6f82d","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Over the past decade, the country has become a world leader on LGBTQ+ rights, from same-sex marriage and equal adoption, to liberal gender recognition laws for trans people. In fact, Malta was the first European country to protect people from discrimination based on gender identity or expression, and allows those who identify as neither man nor woman to use an “x” marker on official documents.The result? A place where LGBTQ+ people can live openly, and tourists can travel as their authentic selves. “I saw same-sex couples in straight bars feeling comfortable enough to kiss and honestly that always makes me happy,” Akbar recalls.Raucousness is just one part of Malta’s multifaceted LGBTQ+ offering, however, and Akbar notes that it’s also an ideal destination for a chilled holiday. “I think Malta has its own vibe, and I’d recommend it to LGBTQ+ travellers for a laid-back but queer-friendly holiday that’s inclusive.”The mix of vibrant nightlife and calm relaxation is something that 26-year-old drag performer and comedian Chucky Bartolo appreciates about Malta, too. Having been born and raised there, Bartolo recently moved to Glasgow, but returns to Malta to perform regularly. “There’s one party a month that I love called Lollipop,” which he says has grown into a huge bash over the years. “It’s thousands of people, every time.” And when LGBTQ+ travellers aren’t painting the town red, “people can lay around in Speedos, they can hold hands, kiss by the pool and no one cares. That’s great.”Bartolo recommends LGBTQ+ travellers visit the (somewhat ironically named) Strait Street, a historically flamboyant locale in the capital city of Valletta that used to be popular with sailors when Malta was under British rule. “It’s a great place, there are really cute bars and if you’re a gay couple kissing in the street, no one is going to bat an eye.”Malta’s queer nightlife doesn’t just provide a safe space for travellers and revellers, though. For Maxine Sophia Attard, a transgender performer who goes by the moniker MadameMaxxx, the queer scene also allows LGBTQ+ performers and artists to express themselves. Michelangelo, a club just outside of trendy Sliema, is one such venue Attard says their promotion and embracing of ersity has been part of what she describes as a “big improvement” in terms of people’s attitudes to the trans community in Malta.While there are a number of LGBTQ+ specific venues to enjoy, Bartolo notes that “most LGBTQ+ people just go to regular clubs”, as, widely speaking, everyone has always been accommodating. “When I go out, I’ll just go out to a regular club with gay people and my female friends. Malta’s nightlife is amazing and crazy,” he says.Inclusivity isn’t something that just happens, as 31-year-old Lilla Salamon can tell you. She’s one of many straight allies who have supported the island’s LGBTQ+ community, and her Gay Guide to Malta provides “up-to-date information on what to expect in Malta during their stay”, she says. “I had been working in marketing for 10 years, and after the Civil Union Act update in 2014 I noticed that businesses were trying to open their minds and doors to LGBTQ+ clients. They just had no idea how to do it, apart from sponsoring Pride week. With Gay Guide Malta I gave them a platform to talk to the LGBTQ+ community, both local and foreign, directly.”It would be remiss to talk about LGBTQ+ travel without mentioning Malta Pride, sadly cancelled this year, which has grown exponentially in the past five years, becoming a “massive, international-style Pride”, according to Bartolo. For 10 hours, the city of Valletta is closed down as everyone comes out to celebrate. There’s also a erse, week-long programme of talks and events, including LGBTQ+ inclusive football games.For Pride week, Salamon says that through Gay Guide Malta she encourages all the hotels she works with on the island to offer packages catering to LGBTQ+ travellers looking for a fun time. She also helps people who are planning same-sex weddings in the country, too. With affordable flights, it’s easy to get family members over for trips. It’s something she says has “upped the game for Malta”. “We have wedding packages,” she adds. “I only work with the best of the best. There are a lot of wedding planners in Malta and there are many who are fantastic. They also have experience with the legal side, too.”Malta is a welcoming place for LGBTQ+ travellers, but it’s also so much more. And that, Salamon believes, is ultimately what attracts people of all sexual and gender identities to the country. “Malta is a place with incredible heritage from a lot of different eras and cultures,” she explains. “And based on my experience, LGBTQ+ travellers are just looking for the same things as other travellers, only with the extra peace of mind that they won’t be treated differently.”* Not his real nameIn the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

The handbook promotes the misleading view that the empire came to an end simply because the British decided it was the right thing to do. Similarly, the abolition of slavery is treated as a British achievement, in which enslaved people themselves played no part. The book is equally silent about colonial protests, uprisings and independence movements.”Among the examples of “falsehood and misrepresentation” they highlight are the claim in the handbook that: “While slavery was illegal within Britain itself, by the 18th century it was a fully established overseas industry.” However, slavery’s legality within Britain was still a matter of debate at that time, as illustrated by the famous Somerset case in 1772. Adverts placed in newspapers show that many black people were held as slaves in Britain.The handbook also states that “by the second part of the 20th century, there was, for the most part, an orderly transition from empire to Commonwealth, with countries being granted their independence”. The historians say that decolonisation was an often violent process, citing India and the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya as just two examples.The letter, signed by historians from major universities across the country, demands that the history element of the test be withdrawn until the guidebook can be corrected and rewritten.Historian and broadcaster David Olusoga said: “This is another manifestation and a version of our history that whitewashes the difficult parts and if this is the history we’re telling to new fellow citizens then I somewhat despair.“With the Black Lives Matter movement what we’ve seen is organisations and institutions all over the world listen in ways that they haven’t been able to do previously. So I’m hopeful that the Home Office will reappraise this handbook and its version of British history and offer new British citizens a fuller and more frank understanding of our past.”Anindita Ghosh, professor of modern Indian history at the University of Manchester, is one of several signatories who have sat the test, in her case last year after some 25 years in the UK.“One of the reasons I kept putting it off was the book, because I personally found it very insulting knowing what I know of British and Indian history to read what was there in the book.Simukai Chigudu, associate professor of African politics and fellow of St Antony’s College, University of Oxford, sat the test about 15 years after arriving from Zimbabwe. He said: “Having worked across a number of different institutions and lived in different parts of the country and so on, I felt like I had a really good grasp of what life in the UK is like. And then you read the handbook you have to take for the test and it’s just nonsense.“It’s an array of some random facts and very simplistic history that the academic in me looked at and could see was a kind of form of national myth-making about the UK, that glosses over ugly sides of history that valorises a very mainstream populist view of the country, a sanitised version of colonialism and slavery.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Given the breadth of British history, the Life in the UK handbook provides a starting point to explore our past and help those seeking to live permanently in the UK gain a basic understanding of our society, culture and historical references which occur in everyday conversations.“We have published several editions of the handbook since it was launched and will continue to keep its contents under review and consider any feedback we receive.”• Read the letter in full"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5517ba601fbd185e89a836425864983b26a0289e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5123e53c6b3194408405d797cdece4e","title":"public sector workers in england share your thoughts about the new pay rise","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, doctors and other public sector workers about their thoughts on the pay increaseAlmost 900,000 doctors, police, teachers and other public sector workers in England will receive above-inflation pay rises to reflect the “vital contribution” they make.Labour and trade unions welcomed the move, announced by the Treasury, but warned that the increases would not make up for lost incomes under the previous public sector pay freeze.

She came alone. In the salty air of Royan, she respectfully replaced the hijab with a blue headguard and gumshield. Khadem had already pulled on a vest and shorts and boxing boots.Mahyar Monshipour, a former world champion boxer based in France, was her trainer. As a man, who was not her husband, he was not meant to be close to her. But Monshipour wrapped her hands and slipped on the gloves. Khadem’s arms and her legs were bare as she walked to the ring in April 2019 for her first fight as an amateur boxer.She also made history as the first Iranian woman to step into a boxing ring. Khadem wore a green vest, in honour of Iran, with her country’s name printed on the fabric even though she was challenging the rule of Islamic law in her homeland. She had uncovered parts of her body and Iran does not allow women to participate in a sport that apparently belongs to men.Khadem is brave, dreams of boxing in the 2024 Olympics and, from there, becoming a pro fighter promoted by Eddie Hearn and fighting on the same bill as Anthony Joshua. She won her first bout last April but Monshipour received a warning the following day that she faced arrest if she returned to Tehran. Khadem, briefly, made news around the world. “I confounded the rules of my country,” she told L’Équipe. “I wasn’t wearing a hijab, I was coached by a man – some people take a dim view of this.”Today, Khadem lights up her small front room in Royan with vivacity and intelligence. The 25-year-old has such a spark she already looks like a star. Khadem has 63,000 followers on Instagram but she is rigorous when stressing the seriousness of boxing.“In football,” Khadem says, “in basketball and handball, they say you play a game. But in boxing you don’t play. Boxers look exactly like gladiators. The punches are real. You can be scared and hurt. But you have to accept the punches. You have to be fast. Sometimes you have to be cool. You have to dance in the difficult situation you endure. You are alone in the ring.”She smiles before saying her next stark phrase: “From nothing to everything. Here in Royan it’s very beautiful. Touristique. I have many friends. Last year I didn’t have any experience in boxing, but now I have 13 fights. I love this life. I choose to stay here. This is very important because I didn’t have a problem with Iran. I love my country. I love my culture. I always believe I’m Iranian. French people really help me and I love them. But I never forget my first home is Iran. My second home is France.”Khadem is in that strange and haunting place called exile. The Iranian authorities have since denied she will be arrested but Khadem feels unable to return home yet. She misses her family. “Fortunately I see them on WhatsApp. Every day I speak with my mum – but it’s not reality.”What does her mother think of her boxing? “She prefer I go to a sport like tennis. I went to a good school. We were not a poor family. I was learning English. I played viola.”She reaches for her viola. “See,” she says. “I still enjoy it.” A viola-playing Iranian woman in the boxing ring is unusual but, as Khadem says: “My mother is a very strong feminist. She wants me to be independent. So she supports me. I just think about other girls when their parents don’t support their independence. I fight for them too.”“After I change my coach it was bad. I went with an older man. I can’t speak about this but he did very bad things with me. I went to the mountains. I did meditation and yoga. I found a person who is very holy. He helped me. He’s a professor and he tells me: ‘Sadaf, it’s better for six months to be alone, to think what you want to do in your life.’ So I stopped boxing and made my body and mind strong again.“I come back to boxing and decide to train with the coach of the national team. He was very good. He helped me for six months but it’s impossible to fight. There is no women’s boxing in Iran. We have federations for women’s kickboxing, karate, judo, wrestling. But not boxing. I tried to create this. I had interviews with many journals in Iran. I speak with the president of the boxing federation. Ten times. I tell them: ‘Please accept me. If you want, I do boxing with hijab, with your rules.’ But they don’t accept me. They don’t want me.”Khadem’s life changed when Monshipour returned to Iran for a visit. The WBA super-bantamweight world champion between 2003 and 2006 had been born in Tehran in 1975. When he was 11, as the war between Iran and Iraq intensified, his father had sent him to France with his aunt. Monshipour discovered boxing and became a ferocious fighter nicknamed Little Tyson.“He was a great name in Iran,” Khadem says. “I see on Instagram he is coming to give boxing classes in the Tochal mountains near Tehran. I sent him a message. ‘Hello Monsieur Monshipour. Can you prepare a formal fight for me?’ And he accepted to help. It took a long time for me to get a visa to France and then a boxing licence. But Monshipour helped me.”Finally, she could step into the ring in Royan to face Anne Chauvin, a French boxer. “She had four fights and I had none,” Khadem remembers, “and she was strong. There was big pressure. When I arrived in France, I see cameras, cameras, cameras. I say: ‘Mr Monshipour? What is happening?’ He tells me I make an important step for women and my country. Now many people in the world look at me. I want to win because of my country. That time I didn’t think about technique. I was boxing with my heart. It was very hard but I won.”Can she describe her emotions when her hand was lifted by the referee? “I was crying. I remember my first coach always said: ‘Sadaf, you never can fight for Iran.’ I told him: ‘One day I do real competition for Iran.’ I did that.”Before the global pandemic Khadem had won 11 of her 13 fights. After six bouts she had switched to a new trainer, Mickaël Weus, and she says: “I am getting better but now it is difficult again. I had fights cancelled because of lockdown. But I have two fights in a Paris tournament on 23 and 24 October and there will be no public. It will be good because I have only lost two fights. The first was close but I accept the defeat. I was a boxer with just six fights. My adversary was champion of France. She had 20 or 30 fights.”Who would she like to fight for in the 2024 Olympics in Paris? “For Iran, for France, whoever,” she says with a breezy shrug. “When you become Olympic champion, it’s you who wins. The country is important but you are the champion. It’s a pleasure for me if I do it for Iran or for France. But I need Iran to accept women’s boxing and for France I need the nationality. It takes four years so it’s not easy.”She points out: “In kickboxing there is a very high female level in Iran. They do it with the hijab – no problem. Normally I don’t wear the hijab. But, if Iran wants me, I do it because I want to box for Iran. But the problem is boxing . It’s not the hijab. Iran just does not allow female boxers. They say men only.”Would it be safe, politically, to return to Tehran after lockdown eases? “I hope so. Everything is possible.”She looks very serious before breaking into another smile. “Boxing is reality. It’s hard but it’s good. It’s just like real life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/293d495396da06b6a6f4be2d22fbd0ac46fc0583/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d29343df55f80b70f9400fa69b30f8","title":"my latest role ali wright photographer theatre makers key workers in pictures","story":"When Covid-19 struck, theatre photographer Ali Wright lost her livelihood – alongside thousands of other freelance stage creatives and actors.

His total wealth now makes him worth more than Britain’s biggest company, the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca which is valued on the stock exchange at £121bn.Bezos’s fortune has been swelled by Amazon’s soaraway share price as hundreds of millions of people trapped at home by coronavirus lockdowns around the world turn to the online delivery giant to keep themselves fed and entertained.Oxfam, the global development charity, said it was “truly shocking” that Bezos had managed to make so much money during the coronavirus crisis, which has forced hundreds of millions of people around the world to rely on food banks and government support.“It is hard to reconcile this obscene figure with the reality the rest of us are living through,” Rebecca Gowland, Oxfam’s head of inequality campaign and policy, said. “At a time when hardship is commonplace, hunger is on the increase and half a billion more people face being pushed into extreme poverty, it is truly shocking that one already extremely wealthy inidual has pocketed another $74bn already this year.”Gowland said it showed global economic policies are “not fit for purpose” and “allow the super-rich to accumulate vast amounts of money at the expense of the rest of us when that money is desperately needed for healthcare and social safety nets”.Bezos’s $189bn fortune, as estimated by Bloomberg Billionaires Index, means he is personally worth more than companies such as Exxon Mobil, Nike or McDonald’s.In the UK, Bezos has more than enough money to buy the big four banks – HSBC, Barclays, RBS and Lloyds – and have enough change left over to pick up British Airways owner IAG as well as Sainsbury’s and Marks \u0026amp Spencer.He has so much money, that his fortune now dwarfs the GDP of Hungary, Ukraine and Qatar. And he is within striking distance of overtaking Greece and New Zealand who are ranked by the World Bank as the 51st and 52nd biggest economies in the world.The $13bn increase Bezos achieved on Monday is the biggest single-day jump in anyone’s net worth since Bloomberg began tracking the daily changes in fortunes of the world’s wealthiest people in 2012.Bezos is now $71bn richer than the next-wealthiest person on the list: Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Gates, who was the world’s richest person until Bezos overtook him, and his wife Melinda have given more than $50bn to charitable causes, including the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy.Bezos has donated $100m to a food bank charity to help Americans struggling with the economic fallout from the pandemic. Amazon is also pumping $25m into an “Amazon Relief Fund” to support delivery drivers and “seasonal employees under financial distress”.Bezos is unique among the world’s five wealthiest people as the only one not to have signed the Giving Pledge, a philanthropic initiative created by Gates and investor Warren Buffett to encourage the world’s richest people to commit to giving at least half their wealth to charity.Oxfam has called for a windfall tax on huge profits made during the pandemic to help pay for the recovery from the economic destruction wrought by the coronavirus.“The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed deep inequalities and massive failures in our economic system, leaving tens of millions of people in the US without jobs, devastating public services and bankrupting countless small businesses,” Irit Tamir of Oxfam said.“Yet at the same time, thanks to a combination of government assistance and pure luck, a handful of companies are raking it in and making already rich shareholders even richer.”MacKenzie signed the Giving Pledge saying she had “a disproportionate amount of money to share” and promised to work hard at giving it away “until the safe is empty”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5e3a68b68f7e6792add16c629e4320411d3dda/0_38_5045_3027/master/5045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f3056b76e93675387c0b5ea9e54e4b","title":"twitter broad crackdown qanon accounts content","story":"The company’s restrictions, which will affect about 150,000 accounts, will include blocking URLs and not recommending contentTwitter announced a broad crackdown on accounts and content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory on Tuesday, citing its policies against “behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm”.The company said it would block URLs associated with QAnon from being shared on the platform, and would no longer recommend content and accounts associated with QAnon or highlight them in search and conversations. These restrictions will affect approximately 150,000 accounts, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed. NBC News first reported the crackdown.“These accounts are engaging in behavior that is designed to further the spread of content that has resulted in clear and well-documented informational, physical, societal and psychological offline harm,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We have been monitoring the situation closely and determined that additional action is now required pursuant to the Twitter rules against our policies on spam and platform manipulation as well as abusive behavior.”Twitter asked that its spokesperson not be named due to the threat of harassment.QAnon is a baseless internet conspiracy theory whose followers believe that Donald Trump is waging a secret battle against a powerful deep state cabal of Democrats and celebrities engaged in pedophilia and sex trafficking. The small community of QAnon believers has had an outsize impact on political discourse, attracting attention through targeted harassment campaigns and “brigading” social media platforms to make things trend.Numerous QAnon believers have won Republican primary races and will be on local, state and congressional ballots in November.In May 2019, following numerous incidents of real-world violence, the FBI identified QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat.Joan Donovan, the research director for Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, described Twitter’s action as a “big deal”. “The Q keyword has brought together a networked faction, aided by automation, that continuously spreads misinformation and inspires dangerous behaviors,” she tweeted in response to the news. “Twitter is late out the gate. Facebook and YouTube aren’t even in the race.”In recent weeks, QAnon followers on Twitter have targeted the model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen, as well as the furniture company Wayfair. Twitter banned more than 7,000 QAnon accounts in recent weeks for violations of its rules, a Twitter spokesperson said.QAnon is based on the interpretation of online messages posted by an anonymous figure – “Q” – who claims to have inside knowledge of the workings of the “deep state”. Q’s lurid tale of child exploitation and elite corruption has drawn followers into a kind of digital scavenger hunt that frequently results in intense harassment of perceived enemies or villains.Followers participate in QAnon in different ways across multiple internet platforms. Q followers congregate in Facebook groups or Discord chats to discuss posts, and QAnon influencers will expound on the theories to large audiences on YouTube. (Reddit enacted a blanket ban of QAnon in 2018, citing its policies against harassment, doxxing and incitement to violence. )Twitter is particularly useful to QAnon followers as a site for targeted harassment of iniduals as well as for media manipulation campaigns.Teigen, who has more than 13.1m followers on Twitter, has been targeted with harassment for years by QAnon followers baselessly accusing her of child abuse. She had spoken out in recent weeks about the intensity and toll of the harassment, tweeting: “If twitter doesn’t do something about this *actually scary* harassment, I am gonna have to go.“You don’t have a ‘right’ to coordinate attacks and make death threats,” she tweeted Tuesday in response to the crackdown. “It is not an ‘opinion’ to call people pedophiles who rape and eat children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b8e0c4f24adb22a12737a3b4c2d928da2a2a8c6/0_51_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1251aee641bd78a35529a702d19b7f00","title":"iceland tiny museums galleries niche collections","story":"Landmark galleries are great, but there’s a fascination and immediacy about the small, offbeat museums scattered across the Icelandic countrysideIf museums exist to make us pay attention, they offer two stripes of novelty: the thing so rare we have never seen it and the ostensibly common thing we have never really managed to consider. Iceland excels at both. Indeed, many of its exquisitely niche small museums manage them at the same time.I mean, there’s an Icelandic style of mitten made with a thumb on each side. They’re out of fashion now, but a pair is kept on display at the Textile Museum in Blönduós. Because maybe the palm of your mitten is getting sweaty wet from rowing or slippery slick from fishing. Why commit time and expense to another pair of mittens when you can rotate the mitten so that the other thumb fits, and keep at it?At the Herring Era Museum, in northern Iceland, there is a collection of artefacts curated by the sea – tools and whatnot still washing ashore more than a quarter century after the herring themselves disappeared. In the south, the Bobby Fischer Centre has on show the last lot of books the exiled chess prodigy ordered before he died – it’s the joke books that stay with me.I landed my first museum job 18 years ago, and I’ve spent a lot of time since then gobsmacked, over and over, that anything can be kept at all. It’s astonishing, really. Things survive floods and fires and famines and coups, neglect or obsolescence or daily use. They survive not just in vaults and tombs and cold storage, but testify from bookshelves to how dearly we need touchstones, how much it matters to be rooted to another time, another place – and how transporting that can be.At the Sundry Collection, in a quiet stretch of Iceland’s northern countryside, there is a white-washed board bristling with nails that I love – first for what it is and then for the stories it tells. They are nails so old they were made by hand: squarish, rusty, inevitably bent. One by itself is already a story of preciousness, of labour and skill and a necessary thing hard won. En masse these local nails are something else again – an investment of time, a way of doing things. And this particular group, these nails, are here because a modern man restoring heritage houses would find them in the walls.Only he was the sort of collector who saved every pencil he’d ever owned, sharpened down to the nubs, and scores of keys organised meticulously by size. And maybe the real story is the neighbours, who knew him and thought something should be done with all this stuff. They helped make this place, which is ostensibly about scads of doorknobs and telephones, but is also about how over time that one man ended up with dozens of century-old nails, not loose in a coffee can, but here in regular rows radiating out of an seasoned slab of wood, and still no two of them the same.There will be no blockbuster exhibition of the antiquarian nails. Crowds will not flock to them. They won’t be on posters or T-shirts or tote bags or mugs, though they are among the most beautiful, most tantalising, most telling things I have ever seen.Over seven trips researching Iceland’s collections – the nation has approaching one museum for every thousand people – I’ve visited maybe a third of its museums. Something I love about Iceland’s museums is how many of them start in a living room, or maybe a shed or a school basement or across your boss’ desk. Which is to say, they start on a human scale.I am thinking here about painstaking model boats in a garage in the Westfjords, a pop star’s memorabilia in his apartment further west, and a drained hot tub full of rocks in the south-east of the country. But I am also thinking of the precursors to these public places, places I’ve seen because someone called a friend and I found myself invited to talk at their kitchen table.There is a collector at home on the island of Heimaey whose sofa sags under the weight of a lifetime’s collection of paper napkins – organised by theme into binders. Indeed, there are collections taking over whole rooms: an addition halfway down the western peninsula is now a tribute to the first wave of mass-produced children’s toys. The walls of a downtown flat in Reykjavik are fitted with fixtures from fabric stores long out of business, all the drawers and displays full of lacework and notions of another time.Or you might, from your very own living room, look no further. So often we are within arm’s reach of not just a treasure but a touchstone. And from there, well, who knows?A. Kendra Greene’s book, The Museum of Whales You Will Never See: Travels Among the Collectors of Iceland, is out now (Granta, £14.99) This feast of colour and pattern keeps wall text to a minimum, but tells the history of Portugal’s proud tradition of azulejos (painted tiles) through the objects themselves. They are amassed and assembled with breathtaking variety, in rooms that evoke public plazas, domestic spaces, art exhibitions and holy sanctuary.Hotel and Restaurant Museum, Helsinki There’s something meta about touring this museum – and you wouldn’t be wrong to note the irony of there being no museum cafe in which to end your visit. It is both a serious look at a century of formally accommodating travellers and an opportunity to linger at the exhibit on karaoke, belting out your favourites so the next gallery can hear.Frog Museum, Estavayer-le-Lac, SwitzerlandThere are also military collections to see at this regional museum, but none so personal as the legacy of an enterprising Napoleonic soldier. His habit of taking walks evolved to collecting frogs on those walks, then filling their skins with sand and making satiric tableaux for the taxidermied amphibians to court and dine and go to church. Aglona Bread Museum, LatviaRoll up your sleeves at the great Latvian baking museum and, under expert guidance, craft your own loaf of traditional rye bread. Think of it as a cooking class that doesn’t skimp on context. Before walking away with a souvenir to sink your teeth into, there’s grain to mill, folk songs to sing and scores of old tools to inspect.Botantical Garden of Padua, ItalyThe world’s first botanical garden dates from 1545, and is now a Unesco world heritage site. Take special note of the garden for poisonous and medicinal plants. New flora is added to keep pace with scientific findings, but it is perhaps just as illuminating to visit the species that were once considered medicinal and have since been debunked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/863969078dd14079ee0ce9a1e8efb9c8acf197bd/237_380_3518_2112/master/3518.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bde4e9b0f2ad1c9974c35659979b4b59","title":"top tips from indian matchmaking sima taparia","story":"Sima Taparia has arranged scores of marriages for wealthy singletons. Now she’s the subject of a Netflix reality show“Compromise and adjustment is what I tell all my clients – you need to lower your expectations,” says Sima Taparia. Speaking over video call from Mumbai, one of India’s most well-known matchmakers is telling me what I, apparently, need to hear if I am to find a wife.Taparia has been matchmaking wealthy Indian singletons for the past 15 years across the globe, counting some 800 families in her database and resulting in more than 125 marriages. Hers is an arranged marriage service, harnessing the practice of parents pairing their adult offspring with those of other, vetted families usually of a similar class and caste. Her process is thorough: she visits her clients at home, interviewing them on their requirements and lifestyle, as well as speaking to their parents before consulting an astrologer on their horoscopes and then feeding this information into her database to find a potential match. Taparia has essentially commercialised the practices of south Asian aunties and grandparents around the world, forever touting their eligible young relatives.She is now the subject of an eight-part Netflix series, Indian Matchmaking , filming her process pairing prospective couples throughout India and the US. Where Netflix hits such as Love Is Blind took the concept of an arranged marriage to its extreme conclusion, here director Smriti Mundhra hopes her reality show will clear up stereotypes surrounding the practice. “This isn’t like The Bachelor, we’re not trying to make a spectacle out of people’s lives,” Mundhra says from Los Angeles. “I want to show the nuances and quirks of our culture and the value of the process, especially in an era of online dating.”Watching Indian Matchmaker, the process seems to have all the anxieties and often unattainable requirements of online dating, with the added pressure of a parent’s input. Taparia’s clients, such as the US lawyer Aparna, want a partner who is as successful as her yet perhaps not more successful, someone with a sense of humour but who also isn’t the loudest person in the room, someone who enjoys sports but who doesn’t drag her along to matches. Meanwhile, her mother wants her to find someone who can support her.“Young people are more picky and more independent now,” Taparia says. “This is why adjusting your expectations is important, since all these things they think they want won’t mean anything if there is no chemistry. Arranged marriages are very popular in India but its success is all up to destiny anyway.”Why is tsuch importance placed on family? “In India, marriage is still very much a contract between two families,” Mundhra says. “Traditionally, the young woman will go and live with her spouse’s family. So the vetting is really important, you need to know what sort of family you’re going to be marrying into, as well as what their child is like.”It may sound old-fashioned but Mundhra thinks attitudes in the US Indian diaspora are increasingly in favour of this approach. “People are resorting to traditional methods when they realise how difficult it can be to find a meaningful connection with someone else when the entirety of the internet is at your fingertips,” she says.Yet, Taparia’s work largely applies to upper-middle-class families and with gay marriage still illegal in India, she only deals with heterosexual clients. Mundhra agrees there is a way to go before arranged marriages are equitable and modernised. “We’re showing this process without any airbrushing, so I hope it starts conversations around the changes that need to be made and questions the pressure that parents, such as mine, still put on the institution of marriage,” she says. “It was very difficult to get people to agree to be on the show and I hope we can have more ersity on it moving forward. We’d like to do more to be critical of caste, of colourism and of class, otherwise we are not fully representing the often challenging differences in Indian culture.”Until then, the value of Taparia’s work for her select clients lies in her instincts. “Sima is like a supercomputer,” Mundhra says, “she remembers everyone she has met and she never stops working, trying to bring people together.” And, as Taparia adds: “It’s all about socialising. “People believe in me and every day I have them asking for me to help them find a partner, so I can never stop – there are just too many people who need a match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/381c237c34c9c0975aff91ef99b1fc39856a53ab/130_329_4557_2734/master/4557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62ac68447aa21f65a49c0336cb8940ec","title":"macron seeks end acrimony eu summit enters fourth day","story":"Euro rises as heads of state finally thrash out agreement on day fiveExplainer: what has been agreed and why was it so difficult?EU leaders have reached a historic agreement on a €750bn coronavirus pandemic recovery fund and their long-term spending plans following days of acrimonious debate at the bloc’s longest summit in nearly two decades.As the meeting reached its fifth day, the 27 exhausted heads of state and government finally gave their seal of approval to a plan for the EU to jointly borrow debt to be disbursed through grants on an unprecedented scale, in the face of an economic downturn not seen since the Great Depression.The end of the tortuous process was announced by the European council president, Charles Michel, who had been chairing the leaders’ long debates, with a single word on Twitter: “Deal!”The euro rose against the dollar on the news to stand at $1.145. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, described it as a “historic day for Europe”.Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said the negotiations, lasting more than 90 hours, had been “worth it” and that the EU could not be accused this time of doing “too little, too late”.Talks for the hard-won deal pitted north against south and east against west as governments haggled over the terms of both the bloc’s seven-year budget and a one-off economic stimulus.The summit, stretching from Friday morning into the early hours of Tuesday, was so prolonged that two leaders, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg and Ireland’s Micheál Martin, briefly returned home before coming back to Brussels.Despite initial opposition from the so-called frugal states of the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark, agreement was finally found, following a final 5.15am session of the 27 on Tuesday morning, to disburse vast sums in the form of non-repayable grants to countries most stricken by the coronavirus pandemic.The breakthrough followed a new proposal from Michel for the EU to pay out €390bn in grants and €360bn in loans from the new economic reconstruction fund.The “frugal” states had been pushing for the original proposal by the European commission for €500bn in grants to be reduced to €350bn, to the evident frustration of Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, had at one stage warned his Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte, who led the way on reducing the level of grants, that he might become a hero at home but that he faced being blamed by the rest of Europe for his lack of solidarity.But Michel’s new formulation, emerging out of hours of bilateral talks with the leaders on both sides of the debate outside of the full plenary sessions, finally received the unanimous support it required.“This recovery fund is indeed a historic change and a historic step for Europe,” said Macron, in a joint press conference with Merkel.At one point during the bad-tempered negotiations Macron had thumped the table in frustration and likened those thwarting his spending plans to the ill-fated British in previous budget negotiations.The final outcome is a messy bundle of compromises. As part of the deal, the “frugals” will receive significant increases in the rebates they receive on their budget contributions, a throwback from 1984 when Margaret Thatcher secured discounts on the UK’s outsized budget contributions.Merkel said the British departure had changed the balance among the remaining 27 members and created a new dynamic.Michel also watered down his initial proposal for holding up the disbursement of funds both where there are concerns over either a lack of promised economic reform or the state of the rule of law in a country.Where there are fears that reforms are not being implemented by member states in receipt of money, any one EU leader can halt the disbursement to allow the European council of the 27 heads of state and government to “exhaustively” debate the situation.On the rule of law, France, Germany and other countries had wanted a link to EU funds but Hungary and Poland’s governments, who have been previously accused of undermining judicial independence and minority rights, rejected this plan.The compromise agreed by the leaders instead puts off designing a rule of law mechanism for another day with agreement to be made by a qualified majority of member states.The final deal also swung in Poland’s favour by watering down a demand to link green transition funds to signing up to the 2050 climate target to the consternation of activist groups and senior MEPs.Poland, which stands to gain €37bn in grants from the fund, plus potentially billions more from a “just transition fund” to move away from coal, is the only EU member state not to have made the 2050 pledge.While EU leaders agreed to increase the core recovery fund, the so-called recovery and resilience facility, they cut proposed funding for a specific climate programme, as well as research and health - all priorities for the “frugal” four.The recovery and resilience facility, the main economic stimulus to the coronavirus recession, is intended to help fund the EU transition to a net zero carbon economy by 2050, but environmentalists have criticised the vagueness of that promise. A specific fund to help countries ditch coal, the just transition fund, saw its budget slashed to €17.5bn down from a proposed €37.5bn.Beyond a debate about the size of the recovery fund for countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, leaders had to haggle over the EU’s seven-year budget, which is due to start next year.Michel secured agreement on €1.074tn on EU programmes although the leaders will face severe opposition in the European parliament to its reduced size when it is brought to the chamber for MEPs’ agreement.

On 26 July, federal unemployment benefits expire, leaving workers in Florida to survive on just the $275 maximum weekly benefit from the state.“People are afraid of going back to work because of the imminent threat of contracting Covid, since we, Florida, are now the epicenter of the world for this pandemic, and they are also afraid of not going back to work because we have no financial support,” said Rey. “The real problem is that we cannot afford not to work. Our governor here in Florida is still making excuses rather than plans. There are still people who have not received financial support because the unemployment system is so broken.”Mike Beaver, an attractions employee at Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom for about 20 years, returned to work on 29 June.“When it was announced Disney World would reopen parks, I thought it was too soon, even though some other parks had reopened before Disney,” said Beaver. He said during a temperature check he was sent to work, despite receiving a reading that would not register on the thermometer.Bryan Amstutz, a vacation planner at Walt Disney World, said only a third of his department has returned to work so far, and he did not expect to be recalled until January 2021 or later. “I don’t get paid enough to police Covid-19,” said Amstutz.Parts of Disneyland in Anaheim, California, have begun a phased reopening, while awaiting approval from local and state officials to reopen the parks and hotels.“My main concern going back to work is: I have young children and my mom is elderly. I can’t bring coronavirus home. It’s not really safe to go back to work. The cases are rising in California,” said Inez Guzman, who has worked in housekeeping at the Disneyland Hotel for five years.Glynndana Shevlin, a food and beverage worker at Disneyland for 32 years, wants to return to work out of concern she could lose her current apartment, which she’s lived in the past two years after experiencing homelessness. But she is also concerned for her safety and that of co-workers and guests. One of her friends and co-workers is currently hospitalized with coronavirus.“I live alone and I’m in my 60s. I’m really concerned about going back to work in the sense of safety. We want on-site testing for coronavirus to be available if we need it, and all kinds of safety procedures in place,” said Shevlin. “When I come home at night, I don’t want to worry if I’m going to be sick and if I am sick, if I’m going to be able to have the correct medicine, healthcare, if I’m going to have enough pay.”Unite Here local 11 is currently in negotiations with Disney on safety protocols and protections for workers when the parks reopen.Austin Lynch, an organizer involved in negotiating with Disney, said the union had pushed Disney to agree to perform daily temperature checks for workers before they start shifts, and agreed on providing as much personal protective equipment to workers as they need.But the union is still pressuring Disney to provide on-site coronavirus testing for workers, commit to ensuring staffing levels will be provided to conduct extra cleaning and disinfecting, and to extend temperature checks to guests staying at Disney hotels.“They haven’t covered some of the critical safety areas. Until they do, we don’t think it’s safe to reopen,” said Lynch. “You have to either cover all the bases and go all out to prevent transmission or operate unsafely. Operating and only covering some of the bases just means people are going to get coronavirus.”A representative for Disney told the  the opening of Disneyland was pending guidance from state officials, while worker training, a range of health and safety measures, cleaning, disinfecting and technological solutions have been implemented ahead of Disney World’s reopening.“As we continue the phased reopening of our parks and resorts across the world, promoting health and safety for our guests, cast members and the larger community is a responsibility we take seriously. From increased cleaning and disinfecting across our parks and resorts, to updated health and safety policies, we have reimagined the Disney experience so we can all enjoy the magic responsibly,” said the representative in an email."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056c542fa20e546757244bd6100cb1cf56bd24d0/0_35_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6681ad7832275b37e19643d28803c69","title":"uk targets 12 covid 19 vaccines from around the world","story":"Head of the government’s vaccines taskforce reveals strategy aimed at ‘exploring the landscape’ and hedging betsThe UK government aims to secure stocks of not one vaccine or even two but up to 12 that are being developed around the world, hedging its bets to ensure it has something that works as early as possible to try to end the health, social and economic havoc being wreaked by Covid-19.As Oxford University published early results of its trials, showing its vaccine is safe and provokes a good immune response, Kate Bingham, the chair of the government’s vaccines taskforce, said the strategy was to have an entire portfolio rather than one star player.On Monday the government announced it was investing in BioNTechPfizer’s vaccine and a second being developed by Valneva, a French company that has a manufacturing site in Scotland. That is a total of 90m doses – almost as many as the 100m secured from Oxford.“The strategy has been very clear,” Bingham said. “We have no template to show us how to make a vaccine against coronavirus because it has never been done.” So the intention is to “explore the landscape” and select a few out of each of the four “buckets”, as she described them – the different modalities or technologies being used around the world in vaccine development.“There are the two hairy, scary, sexy ones which are the most advanced,” she said. Those are the vaccines such as Oxford’s delivered by an inactivated adenovirus like the common cold, and the mRNA vaccines that employ a genetic code rather than parts of the virus, being developed by BioNTech, Imperial and Moderna.“An mRNA vaccine has never been approved by any regulator ever,” Bingham said. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson has had regulatory approval for an Ebola vaccine that uses an adenovirus vector approach, but only in the last couple of weeks.“Those are the most advanced clinically, but about which we know least. Then you’ve got the rather boring, much more established vaccine formats, which we know much more about but they are further behind in clinical development. The one company we announced, Valneva, with the Scottish manufacturing site, which grows up live Covid virus and then inactivates it – that is a very proven form of vaccination.“Polio, the new flu vaccines – basically you just take whole virus and then inactivate. They are good at eliciting an immune response because you get the full virus, as it were.”The “other boring approach which is well-understood”, she said, was the use of an adjuvant – a protein to boost the immune system – which was what the big pharmaceutical companies GSK and Sanofi were doing, for example.Bingham said vaccines based on those latter two technologies would not get approval before the middle of next year. “But they are better understood and more proven and, as formats, more likely to work – but slower. So what we’ve done is pick what we think are the best in class of the different vaccine types and secure rights to those.”“So both those two are the ones that – if I had to bookend high risk to low risk – those would be the lower risk and more likely to work in the elderly cohort than these new ones. These new ones may well work – we just don’t have the data.”Bingham said nobody wanted to wait until the middle of next year for a vaccine. The strategy had been to build a broad portfolio “and to recognise that we will lose money by doing that”.She added: “If we’re in the fortunate position that they all work, we will be the vaccine supplier to the world, but the likelihood is most of these will fail. We would kick ourselves if we only had supported the more traditional approaches if the new approaches do work.”She said there had to be commercial companies involved. “The reality is, if you are actually trying to develop a vaccine that can be deployed internationally, you really do need a big pharmaceutical company at your side. A little company is not going to do that well.”The UK is not alone in bidding to secure a supply of vaccine. The US has attracted particular criticism for its America-first policy and the multibillion-dollar deals it is willing to sign with vaccine companies. Bingham said the UK is a supporter of Covax, the World Health Organization and Gates Foundation bid to raise money from donor countries to fund essential supplies of a vaccine for low-income countries that stand little chance of obtaining anything by themselves.What is certain is that when there is the evidence everyone is waiting for that any of the vaccines work, there will be an undignified scramble to buy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/654ffa2a93bf2d50153fb02f49356af364779ffe/0_283_6000_3599/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c09f9fd46a7e6cbf00b547640569cb0","title":"global report nearly a quarter of people in delhi have had coronavirus study finds","story":"Almost a quarter of people in the Indian capital of Delhi have been infected with the coronavirus, according to scientists, raising fears there could be many more cases in the country of 1.3 billion people.Delhi, which has a population of 29 million, has officially reported 123,747 cases and 3,663 deaths, AP reported. The study, however, indicates more than 6.6 million likely cases, with most not identified or tested.More than 1 million in India have already been infected with the disease, which is spreading quickly through the country’s population. Latest figures from Johns Hopkins University showed that there were 37,000 new cases on Monday, only a slight fall on Sunday’s record high of more than 40,000.It is the third worst-affected nation in the world, behind the United States (3.9 million cases) and Brazil (2.16 million). But compared to those two countries and to global averages, the percentage of the Indian population that has died from the virus is significantly lower. The national death toll rose to 28,084 on Tuesday, with the number of recoveries at 724,577.Experts suspect that many virus deaths, especially among the elderly, are not being picked up in official fatality numbers. Testing is even more limited outside the capital.Jayaprakash Muliyil, an epidemiologist at the Christian Medical College in the southern Indian city of Vellore, who is advising the government on virus surveillance, noted that the survey results produced by the national disease centre were an average and the percentage of people infected could be much higher in certain areas, such as slums. “You need to look at different clusters,” he said.In the US, Donald Trump adopted a notably different stance on the outbreak when he gave his first media briefing on the virus for months on Tuesday. Trump, who has previously boasted that his government is doing a “great job” in fighting the outbreak, admitted that the pandemic would get worse before it got better.Facing surging cases, criticism for lack of leadership and dire poll numbers ahead of November’s election, the US president tried to show more discipline in both style and substance when he returned to the White House podium.In a briefing lasting less than 30 minutes, he urged people to wear face masks and promised his administration was working on a “strategy” to beat the virus.The pandemic will “probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better”, Trump said, reading from scripted remarks. “Something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is.”Australia has recorded its biggest ever daily increase in new cases as the country’s second wave of coronavirus continues to mount.Victoria, whose state capital of Melbourne has been placed into a renewed lockdown, registered 484 new cases on Tuesday, surpassing on its own the previous national record figure of 469 set in March. Wearing a mask will be compulsory in public areas in Melbourne from midnight on Wednesday.New South Wales recorded 18 new cases as it fights to stop the spread from its southern neighbour, while Queensland had one new infection to report.China reported 14 new coronavirus cases in the mainland on Tuesday, up from 11 cases a day earlier, the National Health Commission said on Wednesday. Of the new infections, nine were in the far western region of Xinjiang. The other five were imported cases.The UK government said on Tuesday it was investing in up to 12 possible vaccines as it seeks to hedge its bets on the outcome of various trials now taking place around the world. Kate Bingham, the chair of the government’s vaccines taskforce, said the strategy was to have an entire portfolio rather than one star player.It came as two Chinese nationals were indicted in the US for allegedly trying to steal secret Covid-19 vaccine research.Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, also targeted human rights activists in the US, China and Hong Kong, assistant attorney general John Demers alleged on Tuesday. The pair, who are believed to be in China, were said to have acted in some instances “for their own personal gain” and in others for the benefit of China’s government.An attempt in Japan to boost domestic tourism has begun in chaotic fashion after the government was forced to prevent people from visiting Tokyo because of a rise in cases in the capital.The city announced 237 new cases on Tuesday, bringing the capital’s tally to almost 10,000 – about half Japan’s total.The Go To campaign was supposed to kickstart the dormant tourism industry, which was dealt a huge blow when the country had to postpone this year’s Olympic Games."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f949561c77ec169dc08caa4ab2c5cb5834521a4/0_149_3443_2067/master/3443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=295b27a1ed9b0e9818aa4b10e9534eff","title":"us reopening politicians volunteering peoples lives coronavirus","story":"The pandemic has been marked by political figures inviting Americans to sacrifice themselves to save the economyOn Friday, Governor Mike Parson of Missouri weighed in on the schools reopening debate by suggesting that children who contract the coronavirus will “get over it”.“When they go to school – they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. They’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it … We gotta move forward,” Parson said in an interview on local radio.Both join a long list of journalists, pundits and – importantly – politicians who have casually suggested that everyday Americans would be willing to sacrifice their lives for the US to reopen. Here’s a list.Remember back in March, when we were barely into state-wide shutdown orders, and people were already eager for the US economy to reopen? One person, the lieutenant governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, felt particularly strongly about that: arguing the elderly should be sacrificed to make it happen.Patrick, himself a senior citizen, said: “No one reached out to me and said, as a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren?”In April, Trey Hollingsworth, a congressman from Indiana, said it was time to choose between restarting the economy and saving lives – with a surprising answer as to which he thought was the “lesser of two evils”.Referring to Covid-19 as a “biological challenge”, he said: “We do have a biological challenge in this problem but the economic challenge is growing and is much larger.“Both of these decisions will lead to harm for iniduals, whether that’s dramatic economic harm or whether it’s loss of life. But it’s always the American government’s position to say, in the choice between the loss of our way of life as Americans and the loss of life of American lives, we have to always choose the latter,” he told Indianapolis’s WIBC.In April, Mayor Carolyn Goodman of Las Vegas told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that she would be willing to offer up its people as a “control group” for reopening, saying that the shutdown orders had gone on too long.Goodman was a staunch supporter of casinos reopening early in Las Vegas, telling MSNBC earlier that week: “Let the businesses open and competition will destroy that business if, in fact, they become evident that they have disease, they’re closed down. It’s that simple.”Ah yes, the president. In March, just weeks into lockdown, Trump was already on Fox News talking about a great American resurrection – willing American businesses to reopen again by Easter. Then, at a White House press briefing on Covid-19, he spoke candidly with reporters about what sorts of sacrifices might need to be made.“The whole concept of death is terrible,” the president said. “But there’s a tremendous difference between one per cent and four or five or even three per cent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f062e5c9a6d6d31ec42fd479961336bef7322b/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94bb41a72de0d473c25a3378e9b78d27","title":"world is legally obliged to pressure china on uighurs leading lawyers say","story":"Exclusive: Sanctions on China and companies operating there, along with use of treaty agreements, can bring Beijing to account, British barristers argueThe international community is legally obliged to take action on China’s alleged abuse of Uighur and other Turkic minorities, a prominent group of British lawyers has said, suggesting nations use sanctions, corporate accountability mechanisms, and international treaties preventing racial discrimination to pressure Beijing.China’s refusal to be held legally accountable for the widespread and documented allegations did not absolve the global community of responsibility, the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales (BHRC) said in a report released on Wednesday.“All states, including China, have unequivocally accepted that slavery and racial discrimination, torture and genocide are prohibited,” it said.“They have committed to not carry out those proscribed acts they have committed to their prevention and they have committed to punishment of perpetrators where they have found iniduals to have committed those proscribed acts. There can be no derogation from those commitments.”The BHRC briefing paper, written by some of Britain’s leading human rights barristers, underlines a growing push for concrete action against China’s crackdown in Xinjiang. It also provides some of the most specific recommendations yet for states to pressure Beijing into meeting legal obligations to its own people, and to ensure that other states do not breach their obligations by failing to act.The report is the strongest intervention so far from the British legal community at a time when the UK and the international community have become increasingly vocal in condemning Beijing’s measures in Xinjiang.“The UK must take all available measures to prevent and seek to end human rights violations,” it said. Abuse and mistreatment of the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang has been extensively documented but strenuously denied by Beijing, which claims its policies are to counter terrorism.The evidence of mass detention in “re-education camps”, surveillance and restrictions on religious and cultural beliefs amounts to cultural genocide, critics have said. There have also been reports of forced sterilisation of Uighur women, alleged efforts to curb the growth of the Uighur population which human rights investigators say provide the clearest evidence yet of genocide.On Sunday, the UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab accused China of “gross and egregious” human rights abuses. The US government recently announced Magnitsky style sanctions against Chinese officials over the allegations, and on Tuesday France demanded independent observers be allowed into Xinjiang.Schona Jolly QC, chair of the BHRC, told the  the international community could not claim ignorance in the face of the evidence.“Governments must take concrete and urgent steps towards accountability and redress before an entire community is devastated through the deliberate, targeted and systematic abuse which has been credibly alleged,” she said.“Courageous investigative journalism and testimony by survivors and witnesses has exposed grave allegations of crimes against humanity against Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang, which the Chinese state continues to deny,” she added.The BHRC report said other countries should use all available means, including international law, to call upon China to cease human rights violations, and to allow and support independent investigations into the allegations of “genocide, murder, extermination, torture, and other forms of ill-treatment, and enslavement”, and to prosecute offenders.It recommended the use of Magnitsky-style sanctions on state and non-state iniduals who were reasonably suspected of being involved in serious human rights violations.Nation states should also create and maintain international bodies to carry out the investigations, and use “all available offices and legal means” to prevent violations, and to investigate, apprehend and punish alleged perpetrators of violations against Uighur and Turkic Muslim populations.China is a party to several international human rights and criminal law treaties prevention discrimination, genocide, torture and slavery. China has placed numerous reservations on them which prevent the treaties being fully enforced by other states. However the BHRC suggested other countries could use the UN’s convention on the elimination of racial discrimination, which had no such legal obstacles.“The global community is not absolved of responsibility because the Chinese state has precluded itself from being found to be legally accountable under most of the usual international legal avenues,” Jolly told the .“States must use all diplomatic means and good offices to pursue accountability.”It said there were also domestic avenues available including requiring that international corporations that operate in or are linked to Xinjiang make sure they don’t contribute to the commission of rights violations.Numerous high profile international brands have been linked to Chinese manufacturers alleged to be involved in enforced labour programs, where Uighur men and women are allegedly subjected to highly coercive conditions, including constant surveillance, the banning of religious observance, limited freedom of movement, segregated dormitory living, and mandatory ‘ideological training’.The Chinese government says the programs are designed to address labour shortages in factories and to alleviate poverty in Xinjiang. It denies that people are force into the work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/243689fd549c7a921b95ed63e9367f4417682bb5/1036_88_3592_2155/master/3592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eb46483c861a6ecb7f04456c8270bf1","title":"great outdoors life moves outside during pandemic in pictures","story":"From art to religion, coronavirus has forced educational, cultural and social life into the open air on an unprecedented scale across the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cc6e3446650b954006f36ff6b6a4a639f437403/525_408_4074_2445/master/4074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9f1c343bda66c8320496f99807f99f5","title":"uk coronavirus live covid 19 latest news updates","story":"More on the fallout from the “Russia report”.

She said: “This funding will provide a vital support to our institutions in their preparations for the autumn. “Each one will be important in our recovery as they work with schools, business, international partners and public services.”The announcement comes after the country’s health minister said the NHS in Wales faces a “truly extraordinary” autumn and winter with the combined challenges of a possible second wave of coronavirus, rising waiting lists and the annual flu season.Meanwhile, health officials said there have been no further reported deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus in Wales. The total number of deaths remains at 1,547.The total number of cases in the country increased by 22, bringing the revised total of confirmed cases to 16,965, Public Health Wales said.A study has suggested women and young people have been hardest hit psychologically by the Covid-19 lockdown, as MPs were told the world will be living with Covid-19 for “decades to come”.Sally McManus, joint senior author of the study from City University, said: “The pandemic has brought people’s differing life circumstances into stark contrast.

According to the email, the childcare worker was working in the creche on Monday, July 13th and was asymptomatic.“The purpose of this email is to reassure you that all protocols from the HSE and Tusla have been followed,” the email states. “Most importantly all parents whose children have been in contact with the asymptomatic educarer have been phoned personally and appropriate testing has been arranged.”“Likewise, the small number of staff members who were in direct contact with the educarer in question are being tested and while awaiting results will not be in attendance at creche.”The childcare facility, which remains open, did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication.The news comes after acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn warned on Monday that workplaces were the “new frontline” in the fight against coronavirus.Several workplaces, including building sites, supermarkets and fast-food outlets, had reported new cases among staff in recent days, Dr Glynn said.The HSE said it cannot comment on inidual cases or activations “to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the businesses and the people who work there”.Speaking generally, a spokeswoman for the HSE said where there is a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a childcare setting, the facility is contacted by the HSE public health team who conduct an assessment of the facility.Based on this assessment, the public health team will then issue advice on the management of children and staff who came in contact with the case, the spokeswoman added.Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman, commenting on the case in the Dáil, said all the supports were being provided for “any person impacted and to ensure the necessary actions were being taken to prevent any spread of the virus”.Mr O’Gorman said he could not comment on any inidual cases but “the HSE and Tusla have been involved and all appropriate action has been taken”.He said the guidance provided by the HPSC, the regulator, Tusla and his department “have proven valuable in ensuring the appropriate management of the case”.Creches and childcare facilities across the State reopened their doors on June 29th, having been closed since mid-March. Among the protocols in place to stop the spread of Covid-19 in childcare facilities are the ision of children into pods, staggered drop-off times, increased cleaning regimes and social distancing between staff.In the Health Protection and Surveillance Centre (HPSC) guidance on coronavirus in childcare settings, it states that confirmed Covid-19 cases should continue to self-isolate at home for a minimum of 14 days and should not return to the childcare setting until they are advised that it is safe to do so.The guidance adds that close contacts of a confirmed case should go home and restrict their movements for 14 days and should not attend the facility during that time.Close contacts of confirmed cases are offered testing for Covid-19 and will need to stay away from the childcare centre for 14 days even if the virus is not detected on the tests.This is because some people who are infected do not have a positive test at the time the test was taken, the guidance states.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Government says \u0026lsquosafest thing to do is not to travel\u0026rsquo but quarantine not needed for those arriving from selected locationsCitizenship campaigner will also be the NI spokesperson for votingrights.ieNoonan wants strategy aimed at creating \u0026lsquovibrant communities of people living aboard their vessels\u0026rsquoThe 170km pipeline will carry water from the lower river Shannon to south DublinOther reforms include allowing convicted criminals to be sentenced over video-linkState in line for large share of \u0026euro5bn Brexit fund in \u0026lsquounprecedented\u0026rsquo joint borrowing planWatchdog finds widespread breaches of Covid-19 rules with some workers \u0026lsquounlikely to ever return\u0026rsquoInspections reveals faulty tanks pose threat to human health and environmentConcerns grow for hostel places after loss of 500 beds due to coronavirus restrictionsESRI researchers find that pre-existing inequalities have widened due to Covid-19 pandemicO\u0026rsquoGorman to deliver new funding model, will meet Siptu this week on wagesIssue in the High Court case is whether the fall was due to alleged negligenceA memo to parents states that the member of staff was asymptomatic and worked for \u0026lsquoonly one day\u0026rsquoWinning ticket sold in Ireland as National Lottery urge players to check their ticketsPractice is \u0026lsquoin the Irish healthcare worker\u0026rsquos psyche\u0026rsquo, says HSE assistant national directorCritics say plan lacks climate safeguards such as blanket exclusion of fossil fuelsOrganisations accuse government of sacrificing support for farming and rural IrelandMs Justice Niamh Hyland expresses concern over rights of intellectually disabled womanStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4310334.1595401382!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green list coalition criticised over confusing advice on travel to and from 15 destinations","story":"The Government is due to announce a “green list” of non-quarantine countries this week, but the issue has ided experts and left many consumers confused. Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers at Dublin Airport. File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe Government has been accused of creating confusion by publishing a “green list” of 15 countries deemed as safe to travel to and from during the Covid-19 pandemic, including the likes of Greenland, San Marino and Monaco. The list was published at midnight following a late-night Cabinet meeting, but the Government said in a statement listing the destinations that “the safest thing to do is not to travel”.“The pandemic is not over and the public health advice remains the same,” a spokesman said in a statement.The following countries were deemed as safe for travel with “normal precautions” - Malta, Finland, Norway, Italy, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cyprus, Slovakia, Greece, Greenland, Gibraltar, Monaco and San Marino. No quarantineThis means that passengers entering Ireland from these countries will not be required to spend 14 days in quarantine. The 15 locations have rates of coronavirus cases that are similar or lower than that currently in the State. Several popular destinations for Irish tourists including France, Spain, Portugal, the UK and the US did not, as expected, make it on to the “green list”. The advice states that all passengers, regardless of the originating country, will have to fill out a Passenger Locator Form to allow for contact tracing after their arrival. Some random coronavirus testing will be conducted for passengers from high risk countries.The list will be reviewed every fortnight and official advice remains that people should only undertake essential travel. The Government statement also confirmed there was no change in relation to the policy on travelling to and from Northern Ireland. ContradictorySinn Féin transport spokesman Darren O’Rourke criticised the list, saying it sent out contradictory and confusing messages. “We now have a ‘green list’ that identifies countries that people can travel to and from without the need to quarantine, but advice against all non-essential foreign travel appears to remain in place. This makes very little sense and sends a very mixed message at a critical time in our Covid-19 response,” he said.Róisín Shortall, co-leader of the Social Democrats, described the list as “meaningless” as the advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team was that no non-essential travel should be undertaken. The Cabinet meeting began at 8.45pm and followed obvious isions in the Government on Tuesday over the travel plans, with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar criticising mixed messages from his own Government. Senior sources on Tuesday night conceded there were isions and confusion within Government on the subject.Mr Varadkar on Tuesday suggested if there was not a very clear message around the policy “then we would be better off not having a green list”. Speaking as he arrived at Dublin Castle, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris denied there were any splits within Cabinet on the proposal. He said during the Covid-19 crisis all three parties in Government “pull together regardless of political persuasion”. He also said that clarity was needed in relation to international travel. The list of safe countries was proposed in June by the Fine Gael-led government, when Mr Varadkar was taoiseach, at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic seemed to be receding and many EU countries were reopening their borders. Reproduction rateWith the reproduction rate of the virus having increased in many countries during July, Fianna Fáil and Green Ministers raised doubts at a Cabinet meeting last Wednesday about the advisability of proceeding with a list where people (including Irish tourists) arriving from certain countries with low virus levels will not be subject to quarantine of 14 days. Ministers from the two parties argued there was an inherent contradiction in publishing a list at a time when the official advice was not to undertake any unnecessary travel abroad. “The Tánaiste believes strongly that it’s wrong to send out mixed messages about international travel,” a statement issued by Mr Varadkar’s spokesman said.“The Tánaiste believes there should be a green list as was previously agreed by the Government but if the travel advice for countries on the green list isn’t different to advice for other countries, then we would be better off not having a green list.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4310276.1595366066!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland to get 1 3bn for covid 19 response from eu deal","story":"The 27 member states of the European Union sign off on a €1.8 trillion package to fund the next seven years of spending and inject funds into struggling economies to help them weather the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin: ‘The agreement reached is unprecedented in terms of the European Union collectively borrowing for the first time ever to respond to a global pandemic of this scale.’ Photograph: Francisco SecoIreland will receive some €1.3 billion as part of the EU’s Covid-19 response in the next two years plus a significant share of a special €5 billion fund to repair the economic damage caused by Brexit, officials said, as Irish and EU leaders hailed the “unprecedented” deal reached early on Tuesday morning in Brussels.The agreement struck by EU leaders after four days of intensive negotiations, will see the EU spend €750 billion as a once-off response to the pandemic but also settles the EU budget for the next seven years, the first without the UK’s contribution. The €750-billion Covid response, to be allocated to member states in both grants and loans will be funded by joint EU borrowing for the first time, in what has been seen as a historic step forward in the bloc.The Republic is in line for €1.3 billion in grants in 2021 and 2022, and an additional amount in 2023 that will depend in size on the impact of the pandemic.Ireland also helped secure a €5 billion reserve fund for sectors and countries worst hit by Brexit in the negotiations, and an increase of the national cut of customs duties collected that will help pay for increased infrastructure at ports. There are also a number of smaller funds to which Ireland can apply for assistance.Collective action“The agreement reached is unprecedented in terms of the European Union collectively borrowing for the first time ever to respond to a global pandemic of this scale,” Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil shortly after his return from Brussels.Farming groups and some Opposition TDs, including Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and agriculture spokesman Matt Carthy, criticised the reduction in the size of the EU’s agriculture budget due the UK’s departure, but Mr Martin insisted that Irish farmers were being protected.France and Germany had originally proposed a €500 billion fund to be used for grants to the hardest-hit member states, but this proposal was fiercely resisted by a number of “frugal” northern member states. In the end a package of €750 billion, including €390 billion and grants and €360 billion in loans, was concluded after four days and nights of sometimes fractious negotiations between EU leaders in Brussels. The joint borrowing by the EU has been seen as a watershed. Because the package will be funded by borrowing, there will be no upfront contributions required by member states. However, Ireland will remain a net contributor to the overall EU budget, paying in more than it receives.Resilience testFinancial markets rallied and the euro rose in value as the deal was announced after a near-record marathon of over 90 hours of day and night talks, in what was seen as a resilience test for the EU’s ability to respond to crises.German economy minister Peter Altmaier said the size of the programme, agreed with unusual speed after having been initially proposed in May, increased the prospects of a rebound in EU economies shuttered by the pandemic.“The chance that we’ll experience a cautious, slow recovery in the second half of the year, from around the end of October, has enormously increased,” Mr Altmaier told reporters.Some items on the budget including health and epidemic preparedness funding, climate transition subsidies, business investment incentives and research funding were not as large as had been hoped.Member states were forced to agree on cutbacks to reflect the loss of Britain’s contribution to the budget and the demands for a more thrifty EU by a group of northern states led by the Netherlands."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4310333.1595369628!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord welcome to coalition travel agency flying all over the place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar at a Dáil sitting in the Convention Centre, Dublin. File photograph: Maxwell PhotographyPA WireCan’t decide where to go this summer?Talk to the experts at Overseas-a-GoGo-NoNo, Micheál and Leo’s great new travel company. Motto: “We’ll send you round the bend.”Formed following the shock merger of rivals Fianna Fáil Holidays and Holiday Fine Gael, the beefed-up tour operator is specialising in the confusion market, which is particularly strong in Ireland right now.“Although only in business a few weeks, we have pooled our expertise and driven significant growth volumes in what were traditionally our two strongest regions – Alloverdahplaice and Reckinyurhed,” said CEO Micheál Martin in the Dáil on Tuesday.“Business is booming and now more people than ever don’t know whether they are coming or going. This is down to us.”“Well actually, I have to take the credit for that,” declared chief operating officer Leo Varadkar, in a sneaky press statement to RTÉ earlier in the day. “Micheál hasn’t a clue. I’m really in charge. I was the boss before the merger and I’m still the boss in my book.”Dreaming about an ice-cold copa de Covid in the Spanish sun?Or that perfect germ-free getaway in the back garden?Overseas-a-GoGo-NoNo will make you feel reassuringly guilty by giving you the green light to get going then tell you really shouldn’t be going at all.Micheál and Leo have a unique business model. But not everyone is impressed by it.There were questions for the boss, Taoiseach Martin, in the Dáil in the afternoon. He was asked them in light of remarks made by his second-in-command, Tánaiste Varadkar, about the quality of the recent travel advice emanating from their company.DeferredA “green list” of countries deemed safe for international travel had been promised for some time, but its announcement was deferred more than once, driving further traffic to the regions of Alloverdahplaice and Reckinyurhed. Not least because they were also promoting advice against travelling anywhere at all outside Ireland.Before Leaders’ Questions began in Leinster House, a statement from the Tánaiste’s office set forth his view that this “green list” should be abandoned if the medical advisors to the Government continued to advocate against flying to the permitted hotspots.“The Tánaiste believes strongly that it’s wrong to send out mixed messages about international travel,” the statement issued by Varadkar’s spokesman said. Did the COO of the Government inform the CEO of the Government about this? Their office suites may be near each other in Government Buildings but, at this rate, they’ll be communicating by carrier pigeon next.Róisín Shortall, the leader of the Social Democrats, led the charge.She appreciated the handling of the Covid-19 crisis had been good, and while there were many tragic deaths, matters could have been much worse. But “there is now widespread concern among the public that there is drift”, and we risk undoing the hard work done and sacrifices made by so many over the past four months.“It has become clear the big weakness is the failure to control the importation of the virus from abroad. There is now major confusion about international travel.”Róisín pointed out that “promising to announce a green list of countries regarded as safe while at the same time advising against all non-essential travel is inherently contradictory”.Exactly what Leo Varadkar had been saying in his written statement. It’s not often Róisín and Leo agree on something.Economic falloutWhen the Taoiseach replied, his answer was very heavy on the economic fallout from the crisis. We need to keep the infection rate low for the sake of the economy. (Never mind your granny).“It seems to me you’ve forgotten about the health pandemic and all you are concerned about is business,” alleged Richard Boyd Barrett, to a strong denial from the Taoiseach.“Yes, Micheál. But what would the Tánaiste think . . .”We half expected Labour leader Alan Kelly to ask that question, half joking and half in earnest.“The issue of travel advice now is becoming a joke,” he told the Taoiseach, once he had removed his muzzle. Sorry, Alan wasn’t wearing a muzzle, it was merely a soft face mask. He must have felt a great sense of freedom without it.He gave Micheál a soft savaging, pointing out that while he is in the chamber answering questions about travel, Leo is outside it basically saying “what’s the point in publishing a green list at all if the continuous advice is going to be ‘non-essential travel – don’t travel’?”And, just like Róisín and Leo before him, Alan called time on these mixed messages.Then he folded his arms, looked at the Taoiseach in smiling incredulity and exclaimed: “But really, I’m beginning to wonder who’s the Taoiseach?”That was a low blow, delivered with a chuckle and accompanied with appreciative sniggers from all sides.Because ever since the Fianna Fáil leader took over the reins from the Fine Gael leader, Leo Varadkar has been shamelessly swiping the limelight from under Micheál Martin’s nose. As the new incumbent is run ragged, reading himself into the brief, getting to grips with the requirements of office and wrangling his herd of disobedient backbenchers, his predecessor and appointed successor is having a ball.Still, to issue a statement from his office with lofty pronouncements from “the Tánaiste” as if he is running a separate empire, earns a universal hats-off for brazen cheek.Office of the Tánaiste, or the OTT for short.Stand-offOf course Alan Kelly wasn’t going to ignore this delicious stand-off clearly manufactured by one of the two principals in Overseas-a-GoGo-NoNo.The Taoiseach is saying in the Dáil that the green list is due to be published that evening following the Cabinet meeting, he said. “And just outside”, the Tánaiste said that because of the confused messaging he doesn’t see any point in publishing this list.“So which is it? Is it what you say in here or is it what he says outside?”By teatime, the Irish Travel Agents Association was calling for clarity. Micheál and Leo’s GoGo-NoNo business model is not acceptable to the trade. They can keep Alloverdahplaice and Reckinyurhed. Dumps, so they are and they don’t want them anywhere near their brochures.This may be a tripartite Government, but the leader needs to lay down some ground rules or else it’s is going nowhere.Alan Kelly summed the situation up with his killer line. He seems to have the knack for doing that.“Really, I’m beginning to wonder who’s the Taoiseach?”You have to hand it to AK47 – he’s good at saying what we’re all thinking."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4309674.1595358655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a what did ireland win from the eu talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere were a few significant wins for Ireland.

Photograph: Sai Aung MainAFPMore than 14.9 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded worldwide with more than 616,440 deaths, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.The total number of cases is at least triple the number of severe influenza illnesses recorded annually, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) data, while the death toll in seven months is close to the upper range of yearly influenza deaths.The following is a summary of the latest developments on the virus around the world:AustraliaResidents of Australia’s second most populous city, Melbourne, must wear masks when leaving home from Wednesday as the country posted a record rise in novel coronavirus cases while New South Wales state was on “high alert”. Australia recorded 501 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, its highest since the epidemic took hold in March. Its death toll also rose by 2 to 128. Victoria state, of which Melbourne is capital, accounted for most of the new cases, with 484. Worryingly, more than half the people who tested positive for the virus in Victoria between July 7th and July 21st, or more than 2,000 people, did not isolate, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. Mr Andrews warned that the number of cases would stay on an upward trajectory if people did not self-isolate after getting tested. Meanwhile, Melbourne has seen a rapid increase in the number of coronavirus cases in recent weeks, with the virus spreading to many aged and nursing homes and some prisons. Victoria has recorded more than 6,700 coronavirus infections, more than half of Australia’s total.IndiaIndia reported 648 new deaths Wednesday to take its total to 28,732, passing Spain to rank seventh globally in deaths, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. The country already ranks third in the number of infections. Deaths in India so far have lagged the casualty rate seen elsewhere- aided partially by the country’s younger population mix - but fatalities are gaining momentum and India is rapidly closing in on former European hot spots France and Italy.JapanTokyo governor Yuriko Koike told residents to avoid unnecessary trips outdoors as much as possible during a forthcoming four-day weekend as the total number of coronavirus cases in the city topped 10,000. “I want residents to avoid going out as much as possible,” Ms Koike said at a meeting of a panel of experts advising the city. “If you are going outside, take the utmost precautions to avoid infection.” Japan’s capital had another 230 or more cases on Wednesday, Ms Koike said earlier. Hospitalisations in Tokyo have jumped almost five-fold over the past month, though authorities have stressed the medical system is not under stress. Just 14 of those hospitalised are listed as serious cases, in an ICU or on a ventilator, and the city has had only two deaths in the past month. The city had over 3,800 cases so far this month, more than the previous peak in April when the city entered its state of emergency. A metro monitoring panel said infections in Tokyo were spreading among middle-aged and elderly persons. Tokyo will secure 2,000 hotel rooms by end-July for mildly ill and asymptomatic patients, Ms Koike said.New ZealandNew Zealand’s housing minister said the country can house about 6,900 people in 32 quarantine hotels, with no plans to boost that capacity in the near term. Occupancy of the hotels, currently at 44 per cent, is projected to rise to 81 per cent over next two weeks, Megan Woods said at a briefing Wednesday. A new arrangement linking passage to New Zealand to an available room will be in place from August, Ms Woods said. With the system able to handle about 14,000 returnees per month, officials are giving each airline flying to New Zealand a rolling, 14-day quota of returnees to better align seat demand with the supply of quarantine rooms.EuropeIn Spain, Barcelona authorities on Tuesday cut the number of people allowed on to the city’s beaches to 32,000 from 38,000.Austria is reintroducing a requirement that face masks be worn in supermarkets, banks and post offices. Border controls will tighten, as a significant share of infections are coming from travellers returning from Balkan countries such as Serbia and Romania.Germany recorded a drop in the number of new coronavirus cases and the infection rate eased further, while remaining just above the key threshold of 1.0. There were 392 new cases in the 24 hours through Wednesday morning, bringing the total to 203,717 according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That compares with 590 the previous day and almost 7,000 at the peak of the pandemic in late March.Fears over the coronavirus will see the Nobel prize banquet cancelled for the first time in over half a century.AmericasCanada’s recent increase in cases was expected as the economy reopens, a senior medical official said, while expressing concern about how many young people were contracting the virus.Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro said he took another coronavirus test and the results were expected Wednesday as he hopes for a negative result two weeks since falling ill.Panama will further reopen its economy next week, adding some sectors in the provinces of Los Santos, Herrera and Cocle that have a low number of virus cases, a health official said.The novel coronavirus pandemic is showing “no signs of slowing down” in the Americas, the Pan American Health Organisation’s director said.Middle East and AfricaAbout 2,000 Israelis rallied outside prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem as protests mounted against him over his handling of a worsening coronavirus crisis.Qatar relaxed restrictions aimed at controlling the crisis, allowing citizens and permanent residency holders to travel outside the country and return at any time, and residents outside the country to return starting August 1st.Zimbabwe president Emmerson Mnangagwa said his government would impose a night-time curfew and tighten other measures.Medical developmentsThe University of Oxford’s possible Covid-19 vaccine could be rolled out by the end of the year but there is no certainty, the lead developer of the vaccine said.Brazil approved clinical trials starting in August for a potential vaccine under joint development by Pfizer and BioNTech.–PA, , Reuters, BloombergEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4310063.1595350838!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germans take pandemic holiday as uncertain autumn looms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThousands  enjoy the summer weather on the banks of Munich’s river Isar. Photograph: Matthias SchraderEvery Thursday at 8pm during their lockdown, millions of Germans didn’t go outside their doors to clap for their health service. There were a few well-meaning attempts to replicate the UK’s NHS clapping phenomenon, but it never took off. Germans know that public clapping is no substitute for sustainable healthcare funding, nor is peer pressure a cure for Covid-19.In the last weeks, as I left Berlin for the first time since February, how Germany has fared to date in the pandemic was the common thread of conversation as I visited friends, north and south.There was no shortage of people to talk to about it on the trains, too: with foreign holidays discouraged, if not banned, more Germans than ever are holidaying at home – a new experience for many.“A holiday in Germany instead of Majorca is better than no holiday at all,” said Jens, a 38-year-old father as we slipped out of Berlin and zipped through the flat Brandenburg countryside towards Hamburg.Like me, Jens was heading with his wife and daughter to the northerly, coastal state of Schleswig-Holstein, one of Germany’s two biggest holiday destinations, which is enjoying a holiday season like no other.Staying in a sleepy village of thatched cottages and whispering corn fields, a local friend described how, in the hours after Germany’s inter-state travel ban was lifted, his holiday cottages were booked out until the autumn. There are some new regulations – the cleaning between guests now requires disinfection of everything – but otherwise the season, my friend said, is progressing relatively normally.“For many Germans,” he said, “I think summer is a bit like the carnival season: a break from life’s everyday rules.”Bustling beer gardenThat became clear back in Berlin on a quick pit-stop. I met up with a Dublin friend over here for a summer job just as images emerged of crowds outside pubs on Dame Lane. There was something surreal, he said, to follow the debate in Dublin on his phone while sitting in a bustling Berlin beer garden.There are some new health regulations here, too – disinfect your hands on arrival, add your contacts to a sheet – but the only noticeable differences are the reduced numbers of tables and lack of foreign visitors. My friend said people in Dublin were still crossing the street to avoid each other and denouncing each other online. By contrast, the next evening in Berlin, he visited a rave in a city park. Has the virus transformed the Irish into a nation of rule-followers, he wondered, while the Germans had discovered their inner rebel?Amid the sea of face masks on my holiday train journeys, I was always sure to encounter a few who believe the rule is for others. On one trip, a woman opposite me made her croissant last half an hour before, when challenged by other passengers, she put on her mask with a sighed “If you insist”.Another woman, seated beside me on the train south to Bavaria, decided to have a long phone conversation without her mask on. I moved to the other end of the carriage.Over dinner with friends near the Bavarian city of Landsberg, I steered the conversation to how well the country had coped with the virus to date.\u0026nbspRole of luckOther countries that Germans look up to – primarily the UK and Sweden – are having a disastrous time. Five times more people have died in the UK, a country with one-third fewer people, than in Germany and if Germany had Sweden’s death rate, there would be 45,000 people dead, and not 9,000.Even though these are early days, and luck played a part, it has been fascinating to watch Germans struggle to accept that they have done well. Like so often, the war plays a part. Their 20th-century history makes it a struggle, one Bavarian friend said, to think of anything positive in nationalist terms. Here, many have been taught that after nationalist pride comes the fall.“Perhaps it’s a weakness of our country not to realise how it’s no accident that we have a good health system, strong science and rational politicians,” said my Bavarian friend. “I am proud of all of that. But if you want me to go out and say I’m proud of all that being German, try coming back in 2120.”As I drank a beer on the bank of Munich’s Isar river, watching teens swimming in the turquoise water, summer 2020 looked next to normal. But, even as Germany takes a pandemic holiday, it’s possible we’re still in the phoney-war phase of the Covid-19 crisis.“The systems here are so strong that many have been able to ignore the pandemic, particularly in the summer,” said a British friend back in Berlin. “People may agree to go back to the Covid rulebook after their holiday. If not, the autumn could bring a rude awakening – even for Germany.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4310659.1595402212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first active leak of methane from antarctica s sea floor revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVast quantities of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica. Photograph: iStockThe first active leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica has been revealed by scientists.The researchers also found microbes that normally consume the potent greenhouse gas before it reaches the atmosphere had only arrived in small numbers after five years, allowing the gas to escape.Vast quantities of methane are thought to be stored under the sea floor around Antarctica. The gas could start to leak as the climate crisis warms the oceans, a prospect the researchers said was “incredibly concerning”.The reason for the emergence of the new seep remains a mystery, but it is probably not global heating, as the Ross Sea where it was found has yet to warm significantly. The research also has significance for climate models, which currently do not account for a delay in the microbial consumption of escaping methane.The active seep was first spotted by chance by ers in 2011, but it took scientists until 2016 to return to the site and study it in detail, before beginning laboratory work.The release of methane from frozen underwater stores or permafrost regions is one of the key tipping points that scientists are concerned about, which occur when a particular impact of global heating becomes unstoppable.“The methane cycle is absolutely something that we as a society need to be concerned about,” said Mr Thurber. “I find it incredibly concerning.”Very little was known about the Antarctic methane cycle but the good news, he said, was that the new seep provided a natural laboratory for further research.Why the new seep formed is unknown. “That is a mystery that we still do not have an answer to,” Mr Thurber said. “It is on the side of an active volcano but it doesn’t seem like it came from that.”Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved in the study, said: “Antarctica and its ice sheet are huge black holes in our understanding of Earth’s methane cycle – they are difficult places to work.The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, reports the discovery of the methane seep at a 10m (30ft) deep site known as Cinder Cones in McMurdo Sound. It is a 70m long patch of white microbial mats, and a second seep was found during the 2016 expedition.“We stumbled upon the methane seep at a site that has been ed at since the 1960s and it had just turned on,” said Mr Thurber. There were no bubbles of methane, he said. “Most of the methane in many seeps actually comes out in what we call diffuse flows. So it’s just dissolved in the water.”The source of the methane is probably decaying algae deposits buried under sediments and is likely to be thousands of years old. In most parts of the oceans, methane leaking from the sea bed is consumed by microbes in the sediment or the water column above. But the slow growth of microbes at the Cinder Cones site, and its shallow depth, means methane is almost certain to be leaking into the atmosphere.Mr Thurber said the first microbes to grow at the site were of an unexpected strain. “We’re probably in a successional stage, where it may be five to 10 years before a community becomes fully adapted and starts consuming methane.”Widespread active methane seepage was reported off the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia in 2014, a first for the Southern Ocean. “But that’s really a different oceanographic area than the Antarctic continent,” Mr Thurber said.Prof Wadham said the five years for which the Cinder Cones seep has been studied is a short amount of time. “So it would be good to see what happens to this seep into the future. The discovery also makes you wonder if these features are more common than we might think around Antarctica, but are rarely stumbled upon.”However, the researchers are unlikely to be able to return to Antarctica soon. The continent is currently free of coronavirus but the risk of infection has disrupted expedition plans.– Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Rampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus has accelerated demise high streets should just","story":"Politicians love to talk about saving the Great British High Street, which had fallen on hard times even before the coronavirus crisis. In their 2019 election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to “protect your high street”. Meanwhile, Labour pledged to “revive” high streets by stopping bank branch closures.Yet both parties are guilty of wishful thinking in assuming government can preserve high streets as we’ve long known them. The reality is that traditional town and city centres are  dying, and coronavirus has accelerated their demise.Consumer spending patterns have fundamentally changed over the past decade with the rise of the internet. In 2010, fewer than 7 per cent of retail sales were made online. Last year, online accounted for close to a fifth of sales. And the latest sales data show that the internet now accounts for about one in every three pounds spent by consumers.While some people will flock back to shops as social distancing eases, many consumers will never return on the same scale. For a significant number, recent months have made clearer the convenience and often lower prices that can be achieved from ordering goods online and having these delivered to the doorstep. No more going to the shops to find the item you wanted out of stock. No more queuing to pay. And no more challenges parking your car in town.There is little government can do to change the way the retail winds are blowing, no matter how much it talks about saving high streets. Fundamentally, the decline of traditional retail reflects technological progress and consumer preferences. Rising shop vacancy rates seem inevitable as we increasingly shun shops.Compounding this is the likely rise in homeworking that has been brought on by lockdown, with more businesses contemplating letting staff work remotely – at least some of the time. Towns and cities look set to see a rise in empty offices as well as empty shops.Does this mean that government should just let our urban centres slide into decline? No - policymakers can and must save our towns and cities. But this will require a rethink of how urban spaces are used.In a new Social Market Foundation report out tomorrow, we recommend a new approach. Why not revive our urban spaces through repurposing them - replacing empty shops and offices with desirable and affordable homes?More housing in town and city centres could bring vibrancy to suffering high streets, and support a bustling café culture. It would also support boutique retailers that have a place even in a world of online shopping – those offering a nice “experience” as well as a place to buy things.Replacing shops and offices with homes would help tackle the housing affordability crisis which dogs so many parts of the UK,  and create thousands of jobs in construction.Government has already announced that changes to the law will come into effect in September, which will make is easier to change commercial buildings to residential use without the need for a planning application. Builders will also no longer need a normal planning application to demolish and rebuild vacant and redundant commercial buildings if they are rebuilt as homes. These reforms could help pave the way for a restructuring of town and city centres.We estimate that the amount of homes that could be built through repurposing commercial space could be substantial – on some conservative assumptions we estimate an additional 800,000 homes could be made from replacing 5 per cent of commercial land with housing.More affordable housing. A construction boost to the economy during a deep downturn. And making town and city centres fit for the future. A lot could be possible if government starts to embrace, rather than resist, change on the high street.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden says four black women considered vice presidential","story":"Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has said that four black women are being considered for his vice presidential pick in a move that would make history.No black woman has ever been either the presidential or vice presidential candidate for a major political party in the United States. A decision on who will join Mr Biden on the Democratic ticket ahead of November’s election is expected within weeks given the party’s convention will take place next month.The choice will not just have major political consequences for the campaign but also potentially the country, with the person elected becoming next in line for the presidency if Mr Biden takes office.  Mr Biden has already pledged to select a woman and there are growing calls for an African-American to be chosen, in part given the backdrop of anti-racism protests that have broken out across America this year.Prominent black female Democrats including Kamala Harris, the California senator who sought this year’s presidential nomination, Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s national security adviser, and Val Demings, the Florida congresswoman, are said to be in the running.Other candidates reportedly being seriously considered by the Biden camp include Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts who also ran for this year’s nomination, and Tammy Duckworth, an Asian-American senator for Illinois.Mr Biden made the new comment during an interview on MSNBC when he was asked if he would commit to selecting an African-American woman as his running mate.“I am not committed to naming any but the people I’ve named, and among them there are four black women. So, that decision is underway right now,” Mr Biden said.It was the latest hint dropped by the candidate, who has previously said he also wants a vice president who is experienced and ready to step into the job from day one if necessitated.Mr Biden, as he has throughout his presidential run, also stressed that if he wins he wants an administration that reflects the ersity of America’s population.“It is important that my administration, I promise you, will look like America, both from vice president to Supreme Court to cabinet positions to every major position in the White House, he said. Mr Biden’s choice is seen as having unusual importance given the circumstances of his candidacy, in particular his age - 77.If successful in defeating Donald Trump on November 3 Mr Biden will become the oldest person ever elected to the US presidency.Should Mr Biden not seek a second term, as has been speculated, then his vice president will be the clear front-runner to win the party’s 2024 presidential nomination.The choice also is a moment of political risk for Mr Biden, who currently enjoys around a nine-point lead over Mr Trump in national polls - a huge gap over an incumbent president.With a little over three months to go in the race the decision is one of the few known moments in the campaign calendar, along with the conventions and the debates, that have the potential to shift the dynamics of the race.Strategists and commentators have noted that Mr Biden is facing a mix of competing and at times contradictory political incentives when it comes to making his selection.Some have urged him to be cautious, noting his poll lead, warning him against picking a left-wing running mate like Ms Warren which could make winning over undecided voters harder.Others have stressed that Mr Biden must reflect the energy of the moment, in particular the public support for the Black Lives Matter movement and the surge of frustration at racial injustice seen in recent months.David Axelrod, Barack Obama’s former top campaign strategist, has urged Mr Biden not to be swayed by overt political considerations but instead pick someone who he feels he can work with and would be best for the country.Mr Trump is widely expected to stick with vice president Mike Pence for his 2020 ticket, despite reports throughout his time in office that he has asked allies about picking former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley instead. In a separate development, Mr Trump has warned he could deploy more military-clad federal law enforcement officers into US cities despite outcry over their use in Portland, Oregon.I\u0027m going to do something, that I can tell you, because we\u0027re not going to leave New York and Chicago and Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore,” Mr Trump said, criticising violent crime rates in those cities. Democrats and protesters have criticised the heavy-handed tactics of officers not clearly identifiable as government employees in controlling demonstrators in Portland.New footage of a veteran being beaten by a uniformed officer while standing still provoked a new wave of condemnation on Tuesday. The veteran had two bones in his hand broken.  Meanwhile the White House press secretary revealed that Mr Trump is sometimes tested multiple times a day for coronavirus - more than the previously known once a day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"masks have made deafness defining aspect identity","story":"A few weeks ago, after a long period of dutifully staying in, I needed to go to the Post Office. I had my shoes on and parcel in hand when it hit me that the person at the counter might be wearing a face mask. In reluctantly asking my daughter to come with me, I felt the independence I’ve spent my whole life building up slip away in one fell swoop.I am profoundly deaf and rely on lip-reading for communication. It’s only ever felt like a minor part of who I am. But now that I’m faced with a high proportion of the population wearing face masks, my method of communicating with the world outside my home is lost. Being hearing-impaired has suddenly become a huge part of my identity.Growing up in the 1970s meant that telephones were the main electronic form of communication, although I was unable to use them. The advent of email, mobile phones, texting and subtitles gave me an independence that would have been impossible to generations before me. To me, my “profound hearing loss” had become a minor disability.I now consider myself a confident, outgoing 55-year-old academic who has been lucky enough to carve out a career in an area that I love and feel passionate about: leukaemia research. It’s a challenging job and requires me to communicate continually with others.To go from such an active, high-powered role to feeling nervous about even leaving the house without somebody accompanying me is not something I ever envisioned happening.But more and more people are wearing face masks. I don’t blame them at all for following a clear and effective public health measure, but the more they do so, the more reclusive I feel. Face masks are now compulsory on public transport.I have never been able to hear announcements on trains but now my coping mechanism of asking fellow passengers to tell me what has been said is lost. What do I do now? I guess I just turn up for my journey and cross my fingers?There are 11 million people in the UK with hearing loss and nearly one million are profoundly deaf like me. Many of us depend on lip-reading and facial expressions to communicate.In the current crisis my biggest fear is myself or a loved one being admitted to hospital and me being unable to communicate with the care team. Sadly, many will have slipped away from the world seeing a face mask moving above them, but with no idea what the last spoken words to them were.The Government’s indecisive handling of the pandemic has meant that masks will become normal attire for much longer than they should have. Indeed, they may now become a permanent feature of life outside our homes. So I urge the public to support me in my campaign for all face masks to be made from transparent material.Transparent masks are available in other countries and need to become the norm here, too.Indeed, I have no idea why masks are traditionally made from paper and then disposed of. Surely it is more economical and environmentally friendly for them to be made from a material that can be disinfected and used again and again?Don’t make me feel I have to give up on everyday life. If you have the technology to manufacture clear face masks, please come forward and help hearing-impaired Britons regain their independence.Keeping people safe should not mean disabling others.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian report proves british voters sensible kremlin thinks","story":"Spy fiction and films have always been popular in the UK, but primarily as a testimony to the public’s penchant for fantasy. At least until now. Now we know that those staples of espionage thrillers - like fiendish poisonings in apparently unremarkable settings - can actually happen in suburban Salisbury.The long-awaited report on Russian meddling here by the Parliamentary intelligence and security committee makes for alarming reading. It lists a range of malign activities, including murderous attacks on dissidents and efforts to seduce prominent people into collusion with the Kremlin’s goals.But the report has largely grabbed headlines for the suggestion that Russia has tried to subvert British democracy, attempting to influence the Scottish referendum in 2014 in favour of independence. If that wasn’t bad enough, the report alleges that both government and security services were blasé about possible mischief-making during the Brexit referendum by Moscow’s English-language media and internet trolls.There was no “smoking gun” but wasn’t this “hot potato” an indication that voters went to the polls again and again under an invisible cloud of Svengali Putin’s manipulation?Well, if record turnouts were produced by the Kremlin’s influence, what gets ignored in all the excitement about electoral interference is the lack of success of any Russian subversion.Clearly, an independent Scotland committed to scrapping British nuclear bases and banning American atomic weapons would have been a coup for the Kremlin. But the majority of Scottish voters didn’t go for it. Transatlantic solidarity is strong north of the border, even if affection for Donald Trump as a lost son is lacking.Backing Brexit, meanwhile, would have shown Vladimir Putin a poor strategist. Wasn’t it obvious that if Britain exited the EU, it would align ever closer to the United States? A Leave vote was not a sign of anti-Americanism. Events since 2016 have surely proved that.Russia promoted a leaked document suggesting to Jeremy Corbyn’s mind that the NHS was up for sale to US hedge funds. That didn’t swing the general election. The “red wall” crumbled because countless traditional Labour voters put good old-fashioned patriotism first and didn’t trust Mr Corbyn’s instincts on national security.Remainers predominated both on the Committee and among their expert witnesses, which could account for why they failed to notice Russian enthusiasm for the “Stop Brexit” demonstrations and parliamentary paralysis in this country until December 2019. That logjam consumed political attention while Russia and China acted abroad.The British public was disgusted with the political class in the run-up to the general election. From Vladimir Putin’s point of view, that wound on the credibility of our parliamentary democracy was something money couldn’t buy.This blindness of the Committee to the favourable impact of “Stop Brexit” from the Kremlin’s perspective echoes their legitimate charge that government and security agencies overlooked Russian activities, much as Whitehall was indifferent to China’s potential influence on operations until this year. Julian Lewis’s new committee will need to have a 360 degree field of vision as well as the ability to focus on specific problems to do its job properly.No-one should underestimate the dangers posed by foreign spies bent on stealing our secrets and suborning the loyalty of key iniduals, but let’s not underestimate the sound common sense of patriotic Britons of all parties. Ordinary people can have different political preferences without making enemies of their neighbours or colleagues. It is intellectuals who can be set at each other’s throats by smart manipulation. The people aren’t such suckers.Let’s admit Britain’s bureaucrats and even her secureaucrats were caught flat-footed and tangled in red-tape over responsibility for coordinating cyber-security and measures against espionage and subversion. Don’t blame the public for that or tar it with the charge of gullibility.Remember how ineffective the KGB was at promoting Communism here during the Cold War? That was because there were millions of patriotic Labour voters who were immune to the Kremlin’s blandishments even when they supported socialist measures like nationalisation. Today, there is no voter base for Putin here. If there is a problem it comes from strategically-placed iniduals like some of the peers sitting on the boards of Russian or Chinese companies.Our voters deserve more respect than some politicians and pundits are granting them. Time and again, they’ve seen through bogus political platforms putting other countries’ interest first.Whatever Russia’s “James Bonds” are good at, getting into our ballot-boxes to rig election and referendum results is not one of them. Behind all the hype, the simple conclusion is that our democracy is safe in the hands of British voters whatever anyone tries to foist on them.Mark Almond is Director of the Crisis Research Institute, OxfordMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 22st july 2020","story":"Visitors enjoy the hot weather at the Mayfield Lavender Farm in Banstead, Surrey, United Kingdom, which is now in full flower following frost damage in May. Should I continue to work from home?

little wonder the Government have been so keen to delay the publication.The UK has world leading security services, yet this report makes clear they have not received the strategic support, the legislative tools or the resources necessary to defend our interests.The Government need to urgently outline how they will address these systemic failings.It has been suggested the UK could introduce a register of foreign agents like the ones in place in the US and Australia as part of a stronger move against foreign interference in internal affairs.Under the American system, people who work for foreign governments and officials have to register with US Justice Department and file reports about their activities.In an explosive commentary, the ISC said the Government was slow to recognise the potential threat posed by Russia to British democratic processes and did not properly consider whether Moscow could interfere in the Brexit referendum until after the event.The ISC report concluded the UK only belatedly realised the threat to political processes despite alarm bells ringing over the 2014 Scottish referendum.The intelligence agencies and Government departments treated the issue as a hot potato, with nobody effectively tackling the problem, the committee said.The Government said there was no evidence of successful Russian interference in the Brexit vote but the committee - which oversees the work of Britain\u0027s spies - suggested there was no proper investigation.MI5 provided just six lines of text when asked whether there was secret intelligence on the issue of potential Russian meddling in the referendum.But the Government - led by a prominent Brexiteer in Mr Johnson - has rejected the committee\u0027s call for a full analysis of whether Vladimir Putin\u0027s government did attempt to influence the result of the 2016 vote.The report was drafted by the ISC\u0027s members in the last parliament. Its publication was delayed by Mr Johnson\u0027s decision to call a general election and by the slow process of appointing a successor committee.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wednesday morning news briefing china bought claims pompeo","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here .

Lipa, who spent part of her childhood in Kosovo and has Albanian heritage, was then challenged by some who linked her post to the far-right ideology of “Greater Albania”, as the map covers different regions. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLipa’s tweet followed the publication of a petition that calls for Kosovo to be shown on Apple Maps as an independent nation. The petition was backed by Lipa\u0027s fellow pop star Rita Ora, another British artist with links to Kosovo.“Would love to see Apple spreading awareness by putting Kosovo on the map! Albania and Kosovo are full of so much beautiful and great talent, Ora tweeted.Nick Cannon stays on The Masked Singer after ‘antisemitic’ commentsDua Lipa controversy over map linked to Albanian nationalismCelebrities sign letter calling for ‘conversion therapy’ banKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but this status is not recognised by Serbia or its allies such as Russia.Albanian nationalists claim they settled the country before the Serbs, and say Kosovo is therefore a country of ethnic Albanians.The claim that Kosovar-Albanians are indigenous to the region has been refuted by Serbian people. Lipa has now explained the tweet further and said it “was never meant to incite any hate.”“It makes me sad and angry that my post has been wilfully misinterpreted by some groups and iniduals who promote ethnic separatism, something I completely reject,” she wrote. “Whenever I post about Kosovo, my feed goes crazy, even if it’s about something as joyful as food or music, and I am met with a fierce resistance to the idea of an authentic Kosovan culture.“We all deserve to be proud of our ethnicity and where we are from. I simply want my country to be represented on a map and to be able to speak with pride and joy about my Albanian roots and my mother country. She concluded: “I encourage everyone to embrace their heritage and to listen and learn from each other.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus infection rate in England is five-times greater than that of Scotland’s, the latest data has revealed.Since mid-May, both countries have seen new daily coronavirus cases reduce significantly, though Scotland’s handling of the virus appears to have been far more effective.At their peak, both nations recorded a similar amount of new cases per day, with England recording around 73 new cases per million people compared to Scotland’s 63 infections per million people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut while Scotland’s rate of new Covid-19 cases has fallen consistently below two per million since late June, England’s is yet to drop below seven per million.The latest figures, taken from Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, come after Nicola Sturgeon said she would “not shy away” from imposing quarantine restrictions on visitors from England.Scotland\u0027s more rapidly declining number of new daily coronavirus cases means that the difference between the two nation\u0027s infection rates has grown wider.Since mid May, England\u0027s infection rate compared to Scotland\u0027s rose from around 1.4-times greater, to more than 7-times greater by mid July. It currently stands at around 5.5-times greater.The disparity between England and Scotland\u0027s infection rates was highlighted in a recent report by the Independent Sage group, which attributed it to the differing containment strategies of each nation.In Scotland we\u0027ve seen such a clear strategy, clearly articulated, elimination is the aim and all objectives are geared towards driving things as low as possible, Professor Stephen Reicher told a briefing last week.In England, the UK government hasn\u0027t been clear about the strategy, we don\u0027t see any particular strategy, some people talk about herd immunity by default, but nothing has been articulated at all.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it,” Mr Trump said.On the topic of Huawei, Mr Pompeo said he thought the UK had made a “good decision” but dismissed suggestions that the White House’s negative opinion of the company was the deciding factor in the move.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Leicester may have been the first, but it was never going to be the last. After a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, Blackburn with Darwen has become the second local authority to have taken preventative action and tighten certain restrictions as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. The Lancashire council has not gone as far as its East Midlands counterpart in imposing a lockdown – residents have instead been told to limit the number of people they accept into their homes, and to wear face coverings in all enclosed public spaces – but the leaders and people of this northwestern region know what is waiting around the corner.“We do not want to end up like Leicester,” councillor Paul Marrow tells The Independent. “It’s all about being proactive, which is the approach we’ve taken.” Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFor now, the resurgence of the virus in these parts appears small by comparison. Whereas Leicester recorded roughly 155 cases per 100,000 people prior to its lockdown, Blackburn with Darwen has, to date, reported a peak rate of 47 infections per 100,000. But all fires start from a single spark – and authorities here are doing what they can to put out the growing flames.Focus has turned to the danger of household transmission across Blackburn and its neighbouring towns. Unlike in Leicester – where officials have struggled to pinpoint the source of the city’s outbreak – local health authorities for Blackburn with Darwen have managed to develop a clear picture of the way in which the disease has spread within the region.“It seems to be household clusters where a person who has been infected may not know it, they may be asymptotic they return home and then pass it on to four or five family members,” Denise Park, chief executive of the local council, said.“We do have a higher than average number of large households – five or more people – so we’ve been looking at that. The most recent data testing shows that the majority of cases are from our south Asian heritage communities.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyAround a third of Blackburn with Darwen’s 148,000 population are from ethnic backgrounds, with a large Pakistani and Indian heritage population, and according to Professor Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, 97 of the 114 cases recorded across the past two weeks derive from these minority groups. To help protect these communities, and prevent the situation from escalating across the region, authorities have tailored their measures accordingly, telling people they can now only accept two visitors into their homes beyond their immediate families.“With it being household transmission, we didn’t think a Leicester-styled lockdown was the right answer,” explains Ms Park. “It’s about being targeted with the action we take.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe response of Prof Harrison and his team has so far been met with positivity and optimism, on account of its specified and proactive nature. “Dominic Harrison has been absolutely on the ball with Covid-19 and he’s doing his job very well, keeping a good eye on the local community,” Gabriel Scally, a member of the Independent Sage board and professor of public health at the University of Bristol, said.“I think the council is handling it extremely well. This is the sort of approach that will work well nationally, because it’s generated by the local community, their representatives and the director of public health – trusted figures that the people can be sure they’re acting in the interest of the towns and the population.”It’s rare praise in these troubling and ided times, when the overwhelming narrative of the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of chaos and confusion. And there’s certainly hope to believe that the strategy adopted by Blackburn with Darwen proves effective.Leaning on the side of caution, authorities have announced that the current measures – which also recommend against hugs and handshakes – will be in place for four weeks before the council considers easing them. In the meantime the region’s caseload is expected to rise due to increased testing, says Ms Park, but after that it’s hoped the numbers will drop again.The story of Leicester’s lockdown – and the lessons to be learntAnd thankfully, access to data has not proved an issue, as was the case with Leicester. Ms Park said that the information provided by the local government to Prof Harrison has contained details on ethnicity, postcodes and ages, ensuring authorities have the means to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what’s going on in and around Blackburn.Additional testing units have been deployed in the local community, allowing more people who are carrying the disease but not displaying symptoms to get easily tested. “Let’s not wait till people have got symptoms,” says Ms Park. “Let’s do asymptomatic testing, do some case finding and then say to people they need to isolate.”Equally, the council has said that footways in the centre of Blackburn will be widened, to further promote social distancing, while some parking bays will be removed to help separate people queueing for takeaways and pubs. Council workers have meanwhile been visiting local religious and community centres to spread the message, and providing advice to smaller shops as to how they can protect their customers.Still, for all the encouraging work of the council, and the sense of “stoicism” that it has drawn from the local population, as Mr Marrow put its, the situation in Blackburn and Darwen has not passed by without the dangerous, racist rhetoric which marked many conversations concerning Leicester and its outbreak.“The danger is people see the data and say it’s one section of society to blame, and that is absolutely not what we’re saying,” councillor Saima Afzal said. “There are are a cocktail of factors at play here.“We are aware there are problems in the south Asian wards but I want to make it clear that they are not less or more likely to follow the rules. That’s not what my experience shows. From what I’ve seen and images I’ve been sent, there are groups gathering from a whole range of backgrounds.” She warned against analysing the statistics inaccurately as “they can be twisted any way you want to portray them”.Against this backdrop of tension, Blackburn with Darwen holds its breath as it takes another step into the unknown. Lessons have clearly been learnt from the Leicester episode, with the Lancashire council well poised to fight the virus, but there’s still a long way to go for the region.Blackburn with Darwen\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Decades of de-industrialisation and growing economic deprivation have left the area struggling to find its purpose – while larger, more prosperous neighbours have reinvented themselves – but the economic damage wrought by Covid-19 could prove to be the final straw.“We’ve been here for 32 long years,” said Maria Elder, the owner of Sudell Sandwiches, a small cafe in the town centre. “Lots of loyal customers over the years. We’d serve students from the college too. We even had a contract with the police to feed the officers when the football was on. That’s all gone, for now at least. We’re barely coping.”The worry for Ms Elder and other independent businesses is what a second lockdown would mean for the town. After a recent surge in cases, Blackburn finds itself walking a dangerous line. The region’s seven-day rate currently stands at 47 infections per 100,000 people and is expected to rise in the coming days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAuthorities have already tightened restrictions this week, urging residents to limit the number of visitors to their homes and to wear face coverings in enclosed public settings, but the plunge back into full lockdown would likely drive many companies to the point of no return.“I think it’d shut us down,” said Ms Elder. “People are extremely scared and worried, because there’s a lot of places that only opened on Monday – beauticians, hairdressers. And it’s still very quiet.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“We’ve been here a long time, we’re an established business, but it has seriously impacted us, it really has. I’ve had to lay off one girl as a result.”Asad Jalil, who has run a dry cleaning shop in the town centre since 1989, said a second lockdown would push his business “over the edge”.“If there’s another lockdown for two or three weeks, it’s going to make it worse. People are already scared. There’s not enough money for going out, buying new stuff, people are making do with what they’ve got. “I can’t see my business returning. I doubt I’ll be here next year. Many of my usual customers are at home, working in their pyjamas. They don’t need to go into the office anymore. They don’t need to get their suits cleaned. I only came back yesterday but I don’t think it’s going to pick up again.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSome businesses never made it to the end of lockdown, laid low by the sudden arrest in economic activity across the country. Although trade has been good for Anna Green and Emily Yates since they reopened their salon earlier this month, they are one of the few to have come through this period of turbulence.“In this building alone, there’s one room empty next door and upstairs there’s six empty,” Ms Green said. “They’ve had to fold. It’s not the most affluent of areas. A lot of people have packed up and gone.”The pandemic has only added to Blackburn’s problems. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly one-third since 2010, losing out on tens of millions of pounds, while the region has one of the lowest life-expectancy rates in the country.Some buildings in the town centre have stood empty for 10 years or more. Unwilling to take a risk on Blackburn and its struggling economy, business has been turning elsewhere in the northwest.“Blackburn was a booming town,” said Mr Jalil, the dry cleaner owner. “People used to flock here from all around, but now they don’t even bother. They either go into Bolton or Preston. There’s no footfall in Blackburn anymore.”Deprivation is also a serious and growing issue. Last year, the charity End Child Poverty revealed that half of all children in Blackburn lived in poverty, with this rate up to two-thirds in the ward of Bastwell.Nonetheless, stoicism runs deep in these parts. Residents are aware that everyone has a role to play in getting through the pandemic.Blackburn holds its breath after recent spike in Covid-19 cases“Everyone is putting on face masks, all our customers are taking it on board,” said Marcus Gannon, director of Hobkirk Sewing Machines, which can trace its history in the town back to 1903. “No one has got anything against it. They all appreciate it. And in a way, it gives customers who want to come in here the confidence to do so. People are just getting on with it.”Ms Elder, the cafe owner, echoed these sentiments, saying that “the majority of people are now wearing masks” and abiding by the rules – at least in public. “Everyone is taking it seriously,” she said. “I think the new restrictions are a good thing but we’ll have to see how it goes.”The council has also been working hard with small businesses to ensure they can operate under the current system. “I know some of our officers have been out and helped put the new guidance in place,” said Saima Afzal, a councillor. “Everyone has been really proactive. I think we’ve got a really resilient community in Blackburn so they are carrying on.”“My company has been here for 100 odd years,” said Mr Gannon. “I want it to be here another 100 years. We can’t give in.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

I wasn’t even in communication with Elon until 2016.”In his written witness statement, Mr Romero said: “From March 2015 onwards, Ms Heard was visited regularly late at night, at around 11pm to midnight, by Mr Elon Musk.”The concierge said Ms Heard gave Mr Musk his own fob to access the building.On Monday, Ms Heard claimed she feared Mr Depp was “going to kill” her on several occasions – and says he would later blame his actions on “the monster”, an “alter ego” she says she was “terrified of”.Ms Heard has accused Mr Depp of verbal and physical abuse throughout their relationship, including screaming, swearing, punching, slapping, kicking, headbutting and choking her, as well as “extremely controlling and intimidating behaviour”.Amber Heard says ‘monster’ Johnny Depp threatened to kill herMs Heard also told the court that during a 2015 trip to Australia Mr Depp pushed her down against a home bar and pressed so hard on her neck that she could not breathe as she was cut by the broken glass around her.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You’re really hurting me, stop please.”“It was like he couldn’t hear me,” she added.During his testimony Mr Depp denied allegations of abuse towards his former wife, saying he was “not violent towards Ms Heard – it was she who was violent to him”.The Aquaman actor, who met Mr Depp on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary, has since  insisted she was never violent towards her ex-husband and would only “try to defend” herself when he “got serious”.‘No marks’ on Heard’s face after alleged assault, Depp’s friend claimsShe said: “When I felt my life was threatened, I tried to defend myself and that started to happen years into the relationship, years into the violence.“Before that, I didn’t even try to defend myself, I just checked out.”Mr Depp is suing The Sun newspaper’s owners News Group Newspapers and The Sun’s executive editor Dan Wootton over the publication of an article on 27 April 2018, with the headline: “Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be ‘genuinely happy’ casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?”His lawyers say the article bore the meaning there was “overwhelming evidence” Mr Depp assaulted Heard on a number of occasions and left her “in fear for her life”.NGN is defending the article as true, and says Mr Depp was “controlling and verbally and physically abusive towards Ms Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol andor drugs”.Additional reporting by agencies.Johnny Depp the sun\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

While applicants could previously go to their local post office to provide biometric data such as fingerprints free of charge, they now attend one of six “core centres” across the country which offer a free service, or another 51 which usually charge a fee starting from £69.99.All visa application centres within the UK closed in late March in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Sopra Steria announced at the end of May that a phased reopening of visa centres was to begin on 1 June, though it said the service was operating at a “lower capacity than usual”, with fewer service points open across the country.Thousands may be forced out of UK in weeks under Home Office rulesWhile the centres have been closed, many visa applicants – including refugees who are required to apply for leave to remain after being in the UK for five years – have been unable to proceed with their applications, leaving them in a “state of limbo” and in some cases unable to access state support, according to lawyers.Since visa centres have started to reopen, immigration solicitors say they have struggled to find free appointments at the six core centres on Sopra Steria’s online booking system, while the paid-for options are charging considerably more than normal.In one case, a Japanese family of five had to pay £2,200 to submit their biometrics for their application for indefinite leave to remain, as the only appointments they could find at the Croydon centre – one of the “core” facilities – were £440 each.Immigration adviser Anton Koval, from the Legal Centre, who has been aiding the family, said: “They had already paid a few thousand pounds for the immigration fees for five people. They didn’t want to wait long as the time they had to submit the biometrics was running out. It’s totally unfair. It’s profiteering.”In another case, a family of seven who arrived in the UK in February 2020 on a family reunion visa, to join their refugee father, had to travel from Liverpool to Birmingham in early July in order to attend a free appointment, because it was the only one available and they couldn’t afford to pay the £770 – £110 each – for a slot more locally. A charity paid for their train fare and provided face masks for the journey.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailJudith Carter, lecturer and in-house solicitor at the University of Liverpool Law Clinic, who is representing the family, said it took her 10 days to find a free appointment for the clients, and that in order to do so she had to log onto Sopra Steria’s booking website at 1am.She said: “This family has had to wait an additional four months to submit their biometrics because of lockdown, and then they had the cost of travel to Birmingham, plus the cost to the local council supporting them and the charity supporting them. It’s not just the cost, it’s also forcing a large family to wander about on public transport during a pandemic. It’s needless.“Sopra Steria is prioritising the paid appointments over the free appointments. Profit is prioritised over people who the UK has an international obligation to support and welcome.”David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), said he had been logging onto the booking website late at night and early in the morning in a bid to find free appointments since visa centres started to reopen, but had only managed to find one.He said most of his clients couldn’t afford to pay for appointments, leaving them “stuck in limbo” for a prolonged period, and in some cases without access to any public services and at risk of destitution.“Some of them who had no status before are still stuck with no right to access anything. The decision has usually been made and they’re just waiting for the fingerprints to issue the card to prove it. They could’ve had recourse to public funds months ago, and during this time in particular it’s really needed,” he added.Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA), said the organisation had been raising the fact that people were unable to access free appointments to register their biometrics with the Home Office “for weeks now”, but that nothing had changed.She added: “It was entirely foreseeable that once the centres opened up again that there would be a backlog of people who needed these appointments, and availability was a problem even before the pandemic.”A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: “We recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.”They said the company had made “significant progress” in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and that, under direction from the Home Office, it was working to release as many new appointments as possible while considering the safety of customers and staff.The spokesperson added: “During this time, we have continued to make more than half of our appointments at core sites available for free, between 9am-7pm Monday to Friday. As expected, there has been unprecedented demand for these free appointments and customers with urgent or exceptional cases can contact UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) using the Coronavirus Immigration Team helpline.”They said that in order to reduce the number of people needing to attend a service point and minimise waiting times for appointments, the company was looking to introduce a new process which will facilitate the Home Office reusing previously supplied biometrics for some customers, adding: “We look forward to providing more information on this very soon.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are committed to providing a world class service and visa applicants still have the option to book a free appointment at six core centres across the UK including London, Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester.”They said other UK visa centres were reopening “as soon as they can, in line with public health guidance, to provide more appointments for visa applicants”.Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.England’s chief nursing officer has confirmed she was “dropped” from a No 10 coronavirus press briefing in June after warning Dominic Cummings should follow the lockdown rules that apply “to us all”.It comes after The Independent revealed last month Ruth May had been due to appear alongside Matt Hancock, the health secretary, but was ditched after failing to offer support to Boris Johnson’s senior Downing Street adviser.In her first public comments on the incident, the chief nursing officer confirmed the report and said it was “regular occurrence” that expert colleagues advising the government had also been stood down from daily briefings during the pandemic.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeizing on Ms May’s comments, Labour said it was “scandalous” that England’s most senior nurse, who appeared at various briefings before being dropped, was silenced because “she wasn’t prepared to parrot Downing Street spin” in relation to Mr Cummings.The decision to drop Ms May came two days after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam sparked headlines by saying that lockdown rules “apply to all” when asked about Mr Cummings during the televised Covid-19 press conference. Matt Hancock warns vaccine conspiracy theorists putting lives at riskOver one quarter of Britons unsure of taking Covid-19 vaccine Oxford coronavirus vaccine is ‘safe’ and produces immune reactionVaccines need mass take up to work- that\u0027s the fly in the ointmentIn the weeks before the planned press conference on 1 June, Mr Cummings had faced intense pressure to resign from his role after it emerged he had travelled 260 miles to Durham and Barnard Castle during the height of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.“It is indeed true that I was dropped from a briefing but that happens to many of my colleagues as well,” Ms May told the Commons Public Accounts Committee on Monday. “That is a regular occurrence”.“What I have to say is I was also asked to attend another briefing later in June but I got stuck in traffic for that one,” she added.Ms May said she did not know why she was dropped from the briefing, telling MPs: “I don’t know why I was dropped. I do know though that I was prepared to go into No 10 at a later date.”On whether she was asked to defend the prime minister’s senior adviser, she replied: “As with all press briefings we talk about lots of these preparation questions, and yes, of course I was asked about lockdown and rules to lockdown.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I notice that at the top of the No 10 Twitter feed I see one of her tweets pinned.”The Independent report in June revealed that hours before the briefing on 1 June, Ms May was immediately dropped from the press conference after failing to give support to one of the prime minister’s most senior advisers. A second source added: “JVT was the first to publicly push back on TV. Everyone is being asked to support the government’s positions prior to the press conference. If they don’t they get dropped. First it was Dominic Cummings, then easing lockdown and now the R-rate and the two-metre rule.”The gagging of chief nurse Ruth May does not inspire public trustReacting to Ms May’s comments on Monday, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: “It is scandalous that the nation’s most senior nurse was silenced at the height of the pandemic because she wasn’t prepared to parrot Downing Street spin about Dominic Cummings’s blatant rule-breaking.“As the chief nursing officer indicates, it’s unacceptable that there was one rule for Johnson’s elite friends and another for the rest of us.”Ed Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, added: “Boris Johnson is happy to hide behind experts when it suits him, but we now know that as soon as they don’t stick to his script he gags them. This is why we need to see the timetable for the independent inquiry he agreed to last week, so we can get the truth out in the open.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When asked for evidence, the domestic intelligence agency MI5 had provided the ISC with just “six lines of text”, the report stated.Live: No 10 \u0027avoided\u0027 looking for evidence of Brexit vote interferenceCriticising the government for avoiding attempts to investigate any efforts to influence the outcome of the Brexit vote, the committee said the government “did not want to know” if there had been interference – and had “actively avoided looking for evidence”.“We were told they hadn’t seen any evidence, but that is meaningless if they hadn’t looked for it,” said committee member Stewart Hosie, adding that the no-one in government wanted to touch the issue with a “10-foot pole”.The ISC urged Boris Johnson to order a review of “potential” Russian interference in the Brexit referendum – a call swiftly rejected by the government.‘Credible’ claims Russia tried to interfere in the Scottish referendumThe ISC found that there was “credible open source commentary” suggesting that Russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.In redacted comments that follow, the report cites what some commentators have described as potentially the first post-Soviet Russian interference in a Western democratic process.”More now needs to be done by security services and the intelligence community to assure the public that elections and the democratic process are safe, said the ISC.Inquiry into potential Russian interference in Brexit vote rejectedRussians close to Putin are embedded in UK ‘because of their wealth’The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Intelligence and Security Committee said it had been clear Russia under Putin “has moved from potential partner to established threat, fundamentally unwilling to adhere to international law” – highlighting the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014 as “stark indicators”.The committee questioned whether the government “took its eye off the ball” because of its focus on counter-terrorism. “It was the opinion of the committee that until recently the government had badly underestimated the response required to the Russian threat – and is still playing catch up.”The report recommended new legislation to tackle foreign spies, describing the current Official Secrets Act as “not fit for purpose”. The report added: “Russia poses a tough intelligence challenge and our intelligence agencies must have the tools they need to tackle it.”Intelligence and Security Committee\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The economic value of every acre of land in countries with some of the world’s fastest growing human populations needs to be proven, they say. Quick wins like logging or farming have so far won out over conserving wildlife habitats.  But nature-based businesses can compete against extractive industries if governments and people grasp their economic as well as ecological benefits, according to Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian entrepreneur and education pioneer, and Clare Akamanzi, the head of the Rwanda Development Board. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat will help protect wildlife species, conserve habitats that provide clean air and water, and keep human development distant from animal species that carry deadly diseases, they said.The pair took part in the second in a series of webinars hosted by The Independent as part of its Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, in partnership with international conservation organisation Space for Giants. “Poverty in Africa is often so high we can’t do conservation for conservation’s sake,” Mr Swaniker said. “We need to show people how nature benefits them and how it’s the pathway to the prosperity that they need.” Conservationists warn of poaching pandemic due to coronavirus crisisHis African Leadership University’s campus in Kigali, Rwanda, was dedicated to mentoring a new generation of young Africans aiming to transform conservation into a growth sector. “As an economic sector this is one that has tremendous unfulfilled potential,” Mr Swaniker said. “As we look at developing Africa we can’t just copy the rest of the world, we have to look at what we as Africans have that is unique to the continent. One of the things that we have that is a true competitive advantage is nature, some of the unique bioersity in the world that can therefore really be leveraged for growth.” Rwanda has transformed itself into one of Africa’s fastest-growing and modernising economies. That growth has in huge part been driven by wildlife tourism, Ms Akamanzi said. Tourism and conservation contribute 7 per cent of Rwanda’s GDP and bring in more foreign business than any other sector, she said. Tourism investors had opened the way for other enterprises to follow. Key to that success was strong leadership, transparent laws, and making it easy to do business, Ms Akamanzi added.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Egypt and Turkey edged closer to the possibility of armed conflict this week over Libya, with both sides preparing for an impending battle over a key city. Egypt’s obsequious parliament voted unanimously behind closed doors late on Monday to authorise president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s proposed military intervention in support of renegade Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar. Mr Sisi on Monday reportedly spoke with US president Donald Trump in a likely attempt to get Washington to convince Ankara to stand down. Meanwhile, Turkey and its Libyan allies of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) positioned heavy weaponry and fighters along the battlefront near the city of Sirte, the central Libyan city that is the gateway to the country’s crucial eastern oil infrastructure.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLibya was plunged into conflict following the toppling of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 in a Nato-backed war. Mr Haftar’s Libyan Arab Armed Forces and the GNA and its antecedents have been battling for control of the country for more than six years.  The battle over Sirte, the hometown of Gaddafi, is also shaping up as a confrontation between two axis in the Middle East. On the one side are the authoritarian regimes of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, backed by Russia and France, who support Hafar’s Libyan Armed Armed Forces. On the other are populist Islamist-leaning governments in Turkey, Qatar and Libya’s Tripoli. Egypt’s military threats suggest Trump could face a disaster in LibyaMr Haftar was winning the war until Turkey forcefully intervened earlier this year, turning the tide of the conflict with its sophisticated domestically-made surveillance and combat drones, air defence systems, and Nato-calibre battle planning. On Monday, Qatar’s defence minister Khalid bin Mohammad al Attiyah, Turkish defence minister Hulusi Akar and Libyan interior minister Fathi Bashagha conferred in Ankara over the impending conflict. Turkey has been flooding Libya with weapons, flying transport planes to the recently captured al-Watiya airbase to avoid French attempts to intercept its ships at sea. “It’s not like anything I have ever seen in my lifetime,” said Yoruk Isik, an open source intelligence analyst who closely monitors Turkish ship and plane movements. “This is probably the limit that our planes can travel. It’s not executed just well, it’s executed exceptionally well.”Nato continues to ‘turn a blind eye’ to Turkish arms to LibyaVideo footage posted on the internet showed convoys of trucks full of GNA fighters from nearby Misrata and other cities heading to Abugrein, which lies about 90 minutes from Sirte. Turkish media reported the deployment of T-122 Sakarya multiple rocket launchers and Korkut anti-aircraft systems outside Sirte. Egypt faces a more formidable logistical challenge. Its eastern border lies a long day’s drive from the city. Its longer range fighter jets would have limited utility without close air support for ground troops.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailLibya’s eastern-based parliament, which is under Mr Haftar’s sway, welcomed the potential Egyptian intervention. But Mr Sisi has strongly hinted that the threat of Egyptian military intervention was meant to deter a Turkish-backed incursion into Sirte and the southern city of Jufra, another flashpoint in the confrontation. “I don’t think that Egypt will go for war,” said Karim Salem, a Libya expert at the Cairo Centre for Human Rights Studies, a Geneva-based advocacy organisation. “Even if they enter the east, they will not go for confrontation. For now, it’s a way to push from both sides that Sirte and Jufra be empty of military presence.”The threat of military confrontation has prompted international players to refocus efforts on Libya. On Saturday, Germany, France and Italy issued a statement vowing to enforce a longstanding UN arms embargo on Libya that is now openly flouted by all sides. “No one wants to see an escalation in Libya,” Mirette Mabrouk, a scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, wrote in a note on Monday. “The threat of spiralling violence, with the capacity to turn into another fully fledged proxy war, might be just the spur to political settlement that was needed.”But forces loyal to the GNA have said repeatedly that they are poised to enter Sirte, with senior officials publicly stating that they are only awaiting the go-ahead from Turkey. Officials in Ankara have been negotiating with Moscow for a withdrawal of suspected Russian mercenaries deployed to both Sirte and Jufra, but the talks appear to have reached a stalemate. Mr Isik called the Sirte operation “inevitable,” driven as much by Turkey’s domestic political calculations as what’s happening on the ground in Libya. The city is the last major urban outpost before Libya’s “oil crescent”, which includes refineries, storage facilities and export terminals in Ras Lanuf, Brega and al-Sidr.

You cannot travelyou are not wearing a face covering.On July , Matt Hancock confirmed that from July  it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops and supermarkets.Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.But ultimately, the new rules on wearing masks in shops will be enforced by the police, not shop workers.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine.Doctors have insisted masks are crucial to slow the spread of coronavirus and make le safer for the most vulnerable.On July , Chair of the British Medical Association’s Medical Academic Staff Committee and Exeter University lecturer Dr David Strain said: “We need masks to slow the spread and make le safer for the most vulnerable to go about essential activities.“Yesterday more than  people tested positive for the virus, which the ONS figures suggest is only about a third of the true number of new cases in the UK.“The remaining two thirds of the population with the virus are the ‘silent spreaders’, people who carry and can potentially spread the virus despite having no symptoms themselves.“The mandatory use of face coverings will reduce the risk to the population at large from these iniduals.”Those who are exempted from wearing a face mask will be asked to get a face-covering exemption card.Those exempt will be required to carry the card on their person while using public transport.The card is available to download for free on the TfL website.TfL will also recognise similar cards that may have been issued by other transport operators.

We are all aliens now.Just as herd immunity kicks in, infection risks drop to near-zero and scientists find new ways to keep us out of intensive care, neurotic Britain has gone into hiding.Boris Johnson warns this will continue until November “at the earliest”, with a chance of normality in time for a Christmas shopping spree.Fat chance. Nervous nellies love being scared.If we get any sort of winter flu — even without a second Covid wave and preposterous forecasts of , dead — many will stay indoors until spring  at the earliest.By which time, UK plc will be bankrupt, its economy broken in a thousand pieces.Everyone in authority has no doubt responded with the best of intentions to this shambles, including Public Health England.But come the inevitable public inquiry, this giant qango will find itself in the dock for unforced errors.The latest came last week when chief scientist Patrick Vallance blithely told MPs: “There is absolutely no reason to change advice to stay at home.”Let me to take you by the hand, Sir Patrick, and lead you through the streets of London.This is the fabled Square Mile, the global financial hub which, pre-Covid, generated half a trillion pounds a year —  per cent of the nation’s wealth.The capital usually attracts , visitors a day.Today it’s a ghost town, lucky to get ,.High-rise office blocks are empty. Street level stores, restaurants and coffee shops are locked and barred, some for ever. In pre-Covid times, you were rarely more than a couple of feet from someone in a hurry. Today you could fire a machine gun at rush hour and hit no one.That won’t change by , let alone by Christmas.Take a walk down Fleet Street, Sir Patrick, along the shuttered Strand, past Aldwych and mothballed theatreland.As Ralph McTell’s song goes, you might see an old man in the closed-down market kicking up the paper with his worn out shoes — yesterday’s paper telling yesterday’s news.That will be the London Standard, born in , fighting for its le.The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, “shocked” by deserted London, warns of dire economic consequences. They are visible already.The Shard is empty. The lights are on in the Gherkin, the Walkie-Talkie and the Cheesegrater but nobody is home. St Bart’s hospital is empty, its thousands of heart and cancer patients left biting their nails with worry at home.Only the construction sites are busy, building brand new empty office blocks.At mainline stations you see more hi-viz jobsworths ordering passengers to wear masks than there are passengers.Firms want to reopen. But what’s the pointeveryone is too scared — or too idle — to come in. Many with secure jobs and salaries are undoubtedly skiving at everyone ’s expense.Only one in five civil servants, most on above-average salaries and gold-plated pensions, are bothering to come in.Are the rest all working energetically from home We are living in a state of collective hysteria, petried of a one-in-, chance of catching a bug which doctors have learned to make no more lethal than a bad dose of flu.The number of “excess deaths” — above the predictable national average — is now below normal.Yet we are staking the entire economy and the health, prosperity and le chances of our children and grandchildren on avoiding a risk which is less than being struck by lightning.THE BBC’s Andrew Marr deliciously caught China and ­Russia’s top envoys lying through their teeth.Beijing’s ambassador dismissed film of Uighur prisoners in chains and blindfolds as fake before squirmingly promising to “get back to you”.

Quick-witted, smart, self-deprecating, incredibly likeable and a bit odd-looking. A man who gives hope to fans, both through his career and marriage to Abbey Clancy.Then a double calamity struck. Euro  was cancelled and instead of ­canning the project the BBC pressed on with SOS, shackling it with a hostage-to-fortune title and all sorts of baggage and “other stuff” the show could have done ­without as well.Aside from a garden centre set and enormous table, around which Churchill could’ve signed the Yalta agreement, the baggage came in human form: Crouchy’s former team-mates, The Horne Section studio band, a guest comedian and, of course, Maya, who provided my series highlight when she got dangerously side-tracked by the host’s leisure and tourism qualication.“I don’t want to sound silly or anything,” said Maya, carefully setting her own trap, “But what is a GVNQ ”“It’s a GNVQ.” Obviously.As awkwardly as hosts and guests have all gelled, though, the thing that’s really torpedoed this show has been the other stuff. Those outside broadcasts and studio features that were meant to fill the ­football gap, but didn’t.Two regulars were a chino-clad irritant called Fast Dad, who competed against the host to win football memorabilia for a viewer and “Peter’s Extreme Retirement”, which included all the ideas Alan ­Partridge would’ve thought a bit naff, like water-skiing with Joe Cole.The game not even Crouchy’s GNVQ could help him understand, though, was a VAR-related pun called Very Accurate Rhythm.On Saturday it involved Mo Gilligan playing keepie-uppie to The Horne ­Section’s version of Hit Me Baby One More Time. In previous weeks, however, it was Tinie Tempah and Katherine Ryan having a go at swingball and Jimmy Carr playing Mel C at table tennis.There’s a scoreboard as well, yet no sense of what the hell’s going on here, other than the fact that not a single ­person at the BBC knows how to produce light entertainment.If they did, one of them would have given Peter Crouch the two words of prime-time advice he desperately needed to hear. Don’t. Swear.They didn’t, though. Crouchy and his mates swore like he was presenting a late-night E show and so ended up with an E-sized audience of about one ­million. That’s the reason you never see masters of the light entertainment art, Ant  Dec, dropping the F-bomb.In its youth-driven madness, the BBC might think this is a good thing but it alienates the people who actually pay their wages and has direct consequences for Crouch who, before this started, I thought, could have become a ­Saturday night staple. Now  Mystery guest round on A Question Of Sport, tops. That’s how he’s been coping without the football, Maya.And ex-Celtic manager John Barnes enlivening ITV’s Stephen Lawrence: Has Britain Changed  debate by telling the audience it needed to “elevate people like me and people like Barack Obama”, asthe former US President had ever worked with anyone of the magnitude of Jackie McNamara and Regi Blinker.You’re far too modest, John.Celebrity Snoop Dogs, Kevin McCloud: “It’s the much-loved Martine McCutcheon.” The One Show, Amol Rajan: “Today’s first guest is a man of many talents, Nick Knowles.”Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, Maya Jama to the host: “God loves a trier.”Loves  He’s sent down a plague of locusts for less than SOS.ANYONE who watched last night’s episode of the landmark BBC series Once Upon A Time In Iraq is unlikely to forget it in a hurry.The story of the  invasion is grimly familiar, but what sets this show apart are the testimonies from its eyewitnesses.None of them wastes words. All of them are mesmerising.Two, though, still managed to stand out from the others.The first was a darkly funny Iraqi called Waleed Nesy who, before he became a journalist’s translator, was pro-war and fronted Baghdad’s only state-approved heavy metal band which, I’m desperately hoping, were called Black Sabba’ath.The other was ferociously bright US army officer Lieutenant-Colonel Nate Sassaman, “a charismatic leader of men” who was hoping to bring peace, democracy and lots of other empty promises to the country until he entered his first local medical centre and: “I’m telling you, the woman running it  She was as hard as a woodpecker’s lips.”Both were damaged by the catastrophe that unfolded and, in the case of Sassaman, helped cause, but they somehow retained their humanity, honesty and sense of humour, which made their testimony all the more astonishing.Like all great war documentaries, Once Upon A Time In Iraq was also prepared to let silence tell the story when the brutality or stupidity became too overwhelming.They made an exception for Waleed, though, when, six weeks into the invasion, President George W Bush boldly declared: “Mission accomplished.”“Mission accomplished  Oh yeah  . . . SERIOUSLY ”Three more episodes will tell you very graphically how well that worked out and they’re as good as anything you’ve watched all year.INCIDENTALLY, I’m grateful to This Morning hosts Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes for revealing blind Celebrity MasterChef contestant Amar Lat measured liquids with “talking jugs”.Which, by a million-to-one coincidence, was also ITV’s original working title for Loose Women.My Strange Addiction: “Eating mattresses can lead to liver damage, intestinal blockage and even death.”But on the plus side, it won’t leave you bed-ridden.Emile Heskey: “When your back’s against the wall, it’s easy to lie down.”Jeff Stelling: “This game will be over when the referee blows the final whistle.”And Chris Kamara: “Three points is another point on the board.”BY the way,you haven’t ever seen Chernobyl, one of the greatest TV dramas ever made, Friday, pm, Sky Atlantic, is your chance.No further excuses will be accepted.WITH no little air of self-congratulation, last week, Celebrity MasterChef welcomed its first ever blind contestant, “travel presenter” Amar Lat, who arrived with a helper and his own super power.“I’ve started to hear the food talking to me,” he explained. “It’s almost like it’s communicating to me and it’s saying . . .”“Don’t worry, Amar. The BBC won’t chuck you out first. It’d look bad.”As good fortune would have it, he didn’t need to worry too much as it was the worst line-up of the series and included Gethin Jones, playing to the camera, rapper Lady Leshurr, whose speciality seemed to be “in-flight meals” and Alan Partridge star Felicity “Lynn Benfield” Montagu, who served up a salad for the guest judges that looked like a Haitian voodoo rattle.The real fall guy, though, appeared to be Jeff Brazier who, at the first challenge, was tugging away at a string of garlic for a good ten seconds before he twigged. “Ah. It’s a decoration. It’s made of polystyrene.”Those people who cry at absolutely everything, of course, were quick to let everyone  know Amar’s eventual progression to the semi-final made them “cry”.I thought the highlight of the week, however, came at the end of the pair’s dessert challenge when the judges’ comments led Amar to ask: “Are you two fat ” and Gregg Wallace replied: “Are you familiar with Jean-Claude Van Damme ”“Yes.”Then get someone to talk you through his voiceover on Minions: The Rise Of Gru.The resemblance is uncanny.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK. The largest  employ , people.But let’s not forget they need us too.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’ve got to back more than one horse, and the UK Government is doing that. We are expecting to host five or six big vaccine trials in the UK in the autumn and yesterday we launched a website to allow the public to register their interest to take part in the trial. We are hoping to have , people per trial, so up to , participants.

Protecting it must be a ministerial priority, with the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism taking the policy lead and the operational role sitting with MI.Responding to the report, the Government insisted a retrospective assessment of the EU referendum was not necessary.The Prime Ministers Official Spokesman today insisted Boris Johnson is absolutely confident the  EU referendum result was fair.He added: We havent seen any evidence of successful interference in EU referendum.It suggested interference did take place in the Scottish Independence referendum, labelling the claims Russia was involved as credible.It pointed to the use of bots and trolls as evidence Moscow tried to interfere.Mr Jones said there was clear evidence of Russian interference not just from the Scottish referendum but also the hacking of the Democrats in the US.He added that despite this the Government still failed to direct intelligence agencies to look into any influence in past or future elections.After last weeks revelations Russia had intervened in the  election by amplying documents used by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the Intelligence Committee said its future task would be to look at into how widespread the interference was.The report also demanded new legislation to crack down on foreign spies, and accused the Government of being slow to act.It said: “It has been clear for some time that Russia under Putin has moved from potential partner to established threat, fundamentally unwilling to adhere to international law – the murder of Alexander Litvinenko in  and the annexation of Crimea in  were stark indicators of this. We therefore question whether the Government took its eye off the ball because of its focus on counter-terrorism: it was the opinion of the Committee that until recently the Government had badly underestimated the response required to the Russian threat –and is still playing catch up.The committee also raised concerns about which Government organisation is actually responsible for protecting the UK against foreign interference.  It said: The defence of those democratic processes has appeared something of a hot potato, with no one organisation considering itself to be in the lead, or apparently willing to conduct an assessment of such interference.The ISC also warned Britain could not stand up to Russia alone.They said: We need other countries to step up with the UK and attach a cost to Putin’s actions. Salisbury must not be allowed to become the high water mark in international unity over the Russia threat.Speaking after the publication of the report, the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed claims Britain had not handled Russia properly. He said: “Russia is a top security priority. We call out Russia when its necessary.“We’ve shown that in relation to the cyberattacks on research and development facilities in the US, UK and Canada.“Weve done that together with our partners, and we are not for a second complacent about the threat Russia poses when it comes to cyber.”It blasted “successive governments” for having welcomed Russian oligarchs and their money “with open arms”.The report warned this gave them power and access to influential figures.It said: Successive Governments have welcomed the oligarchs and their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through the London laundromat, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies and political figures.This has led to a growth industry of enablers including lawyers, accountants, and estate agents who are – wittingly or unwittingly – de facto agents of the Russian state.The report admitted that is now too late to shut the stable door but that the UK can still introduce greater powers and transparency.The report also pointed to a series of  stories pumped out by Russian state broadcasters, as well as through bots online.It has now called for a social media crackdown on fake news.It said: “The Government must now seek to establish a protocol with the social media companies to ensure that they take covert hostile state use of their s seriously, and have clear timescales within which they commit to removing such material.Chief EU Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt claimed the report shows just how many questions remain unanswered about the referendum. Nigel Farage insisted it showed no evidence of Russian involvement, despite the report explaining it did not look for it.Today a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson dismissed the report.Mariya Zakharova said: “There was no sensation. It’s Russophobia set in a fake shape”.Russia has been accused of repeated interventions and attacks on British soil.This includes the Salisbury poisoning attack on spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, .The ex-KGB spy and his daughter Yulia, , were exposed to a nerve agent and fell gravely ill after having a pizza lunch in Salisbury on Sunday, March , .Russia denied that their special services were involved in the attack, which sparked a diplomatic spat and the expulsion of embassy staff.The former head of MI had previously claimed there was no evidence of Russian intervention in the Brexit vote, but that it interfered in the US election.Publication of the report was delayed by Boris Johnson’s decision to call a general election and the need to re-establish the ISC. The PM is likely to discuss Russia in todays meeting with US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo.It comes just days after Putin’s Russia was accused of trying to steal a coronavirus vaccine from Britain.The Kremlin laughed off the allegations calling them “foggy and contradictory”.Security sources say the high-tech espionage was ordered “at the highest levels” - possibly by Putin himself.One source told The Sun the Kremlin was “terried of being left behind” in the new Cold War race to find a vaccine.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Raab also announced yesterday the UK would cease doing any arms deals with Hong Kng because of the power China holds over it.In a joint statement Mr Pompeo said he wanted to use the meeting as an opportunity to praise the British Government for its principled response.Mr Raab said the pair discussed how the UK and US need to work together to make sure the global telecoms industry is more erse after the Government decided to ban Huawei from Britains G network. Mr Pompeo said keeping Chinese state-owned Huawei out was essential to keep citizens private data safe. Mr Pompeo urged the UK to join the US in making every effort to push back against Chinese aggression.After a meeting with Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, Mr Pompeo said today: We want every nation to push back against the Chinese Communist Partysefforts in every dimension. In a tirade against China, Mr Pompeo said: You cant threaten countries and bully them in the Himalayas, you cant engage in cover ups and co-op international institutions like the World Health Organisation.We want to see every nation who understands freedom and democracy and values that and knows that its important to their own people, their own sovereign country, to be successful, to understand this threat the Chinese Communist Partyis posing.And to work both themselves and collectively to restore what is rightfully ours.He accused China ofstealing American intellectual property and reminded people that coronavirus originated in China. He added: We want every country to work against that kind of activity. Its not about language, its not about words. We hope we can build out a coalition that understands this and work collectively to convince the CCP its not in their best interests to engage in this kind of behaviour.Mr Pompeos anti-China speech struck a very dferent note to the PMs insistence yesterday he would not be pushed into a knee-jerk Sinophobe reaction on everything to do with China. What we wont do is completely abandon our relationship with China, China is going to be a giant factor in our geopolitics, weve got to have a calibrated response, Mr Johnson said yesterday. Were going to be tough on some things but also continue to engageon others. A spokesperson for the PM said earlier today: They spoke about shared global security and foreign policy issues, including China’s actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the situation in Iran and the Middle East Peace Process.The U-turn decision to scrap Huawei came after heavy pressure from Mr Pompeo earlier this year to deny the Chinese state-owned telecoms giant access to Britains networks. Mr Pompeo said this afternoon he had had a constructive visit with the PM. He said: Our two countries long-standing, strong bilateral relationship has laid the foundation for todays candid discussion on issues ranging from G telecommunication to our negotiations for a U.S. - UK free trade agreement. In a statement to the House of Commons on UK-China relations, Mr Raab said yesterday: Given the role China has now assumed for the internal security of Hong Kong, and the authority it is exerting over law enforcement, the UK will extend the arms embargo we have applied to mainland China.The Government has decided to suspend the extradition treaty immediately and indefinitely.We will not consider reactivating those measures unless there are clear and robust safeguards which are able to prevent extradition from the UK being misused under the new national security legislation.I will just say this the UK is watching and the whole world is watching.Mr Johnsons spokesman said the US and the UK were still working towards a trade deal as negotiations with Brexit continued to stall.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I do think that they are underprivileged and many [are] without fathers [and] need all the help they can get.During their discussion, Dr Bonar, an engineering lecturer, mentioned she had a degree in physics and Lamonby reacted by saying Jewish people had a particular gt for the subject.He used Einstein as an example, before asking Dr Bonarshe was Jewish.The lecturer took offence to this and shouted that Mr Lamonby was a racist.In response, he said: I believe that the Jewish are the cleverest people in the world. They are much maligned because of it.I askedyou were Jewish because of your ability with maths [and] physics, which is a speciality of theirs.A few hours later, Dr Bonar emailed Mr Lamonby to say that in the future, she hoped conversations they had would be focused on their studies, rather than their widely dferent views on race and national characteristics,But he replied to say he wasnt used to being smacked down like a schoolboy and called a racist.After an investigation was launched, Mr Lamonby defended his comments again and gave another example of high exposure - of Eskimos being good at fishing.He claimed he was shocked by Dr Bonars reaction and said: My comments were simply stating that, arising from my letime of experience, I have come to believe that certain nationalities have developed a higher level of skill in some areas.This is directly related to the level of exposure to criteria such as industry and education. This is not radical thinking it is simply a view that reflects environmental privilege in general terms.During a final disciplinary hearing he eventually admitted he had been clumsy in his language and apologised profoundly.He said he had no intention of being racist.Despite this, he continued to make inappropriate comments during the hearing, referring to ethnic groups as ‘they’ and to Jews having neurological dferences.Vice Chancellor Julie Hall, who chaired the hearing, said Mr Lamonby did not understand that what he had said was offensive. He was dismissed for gross misconduct following the tribunal, which was held in Bristol.Officials at the hearing concluded that the university had a duty to its multi-cultural, predominantly young student body to protect them from potential acts of racism, and dismissed his claims of unfair dismissal and breach of contract.A judge said: For the avoidance of doubt, I find that it is clearly at least potentially racist to group nationalities, races, ethnic or religious groups, by entire categories and to ascribe certain abilities or talents - or the opposite -to them.Following the ruling, Mr Lamonby said he would be appealing, claiming he was a victim of a woke culture and that universities are totally obsessed with racism.I think the judgement came down to the fact the judge was a woke judge, he said.You cant make any comments [in universities] now because they are totally obsessed with racism and to talk about Jews in the context of racism is crazy because they are not even a race, they are an ethnicity.Free speech is totally dead in universities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ive had to home-school my children for four months while I continue to work! They get so much time off and now a pay rise. Unbelievable!!Teachers across the UK have continued to teach kids online during lockdown and many have continued to look after key workers kids at school.But the Campaign for Real Education suggested those who had refused to go back in didnt deserve a pay rise.The think tanks chairman, Chris McGovern, told MailOnline: The government should have held back and rewarded teachers who have turned up to the classroom and worked hard. Rewarding teachers who acted in their own interest sets a bad precedent for the future.Boris Johnson promised parents last month there will be a massive catch-up operation to try to minimise the impact of the lockdown on childrens education.Many have voiced growing evidence that some kids in the ‘Covid Generation’ are falling behind in their studies may not be able to bounce back.Ministers reasoned that there is no prospect of children making up for lost schooling over the summer, and instead proposed a catch-up programme to be extended into next term, and possibly beyond.A study by UCLs Institute of Education this week found that  million children have done less than an hour a day of schoolwork during lockdown.And nationally, kids are spending on average just . hours a day working.Todays inflation-busting pay rises will take the average salary for a full-time public sector worker to £, - £, more than their private sector counterparts.Doctors and dentists will get a . per cent uplt and police officers will see their pay boosted by . per cent.A constable earning £, will take home £ more a year.The Armed Forces get a  per cent rise under the new pay deal, prison officers will receive a . per cent rise.Judges and senior civil servants will see a  per cent increase.It is the third above-inflation pay rise for the majority of public sector workers following seven years of austerity that saw salary increases capped at  per cent.More than a million NHS workers have already been given a pay rise of about  per cent this year under their three-year Agenda for Change pay deal that ends next April.Nurses will get an average . per cent pay rise this year under that deal.Throughout the coronavirus crisis, more than  NHS workers have died in England while caring for patients.The following public sector workers will see their salary boosted following the new announcement:The pay awards for the armed forces, prison officers, senior civil servants and NHS staff will be backdated to April.The rise for police and teachers starts in September because these professions run on dferent pay schedules.The announcement came after Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted the recommendations of all the independent pay review bodies.Each year, independent pay review bodies recommend pay rises for sectors.Mr Sunak said the boost to wages reflects the enormous effort made by those in the public sector in responding to the unprecedented challenges for the country during the Covid- outbreak.The Treasury said the money will come from existing departmental budgets.Announcing the pay rises last night, Mr Sunak said: “These past months have underlined what we always knew – that our public sector workers make a vital contribution to our country and that we can rely on them when we need them.“It’s right therefore that we follow the recommendations of the independent pay bodies with this set of real-terms pay rises.”However, the government was criticised by national trade union TUC for not making up a decade of real-terms pay cuts for frontline workers.The Conservatives previously enforced a  per cent pay rise cap on public sector workers, but this was scrapped after seven years by then-party leader Theresa May in .TUC general secretary Frances OGrady also called for social care workers to join the ranks of those being offered a pay rise.She said: These rises are welcome, but theres still a long way to go to restore pay after a decade of real terms cuts.Many public sector workers, like job centre staff and local government workers, arent getting these rises. They deserve a decent pay settlement too.And the Government should urgently announce a pay rise for social care workers, who put their lives on the line to care for others during this pandemic.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But mainly about the kids, their future, and the dferent directions they’re going in.“They’ve barely had a ing marriage for the last year and Kim has been finding living with him too dficult.“He’s very demanding and always obsessed with one of his schemes — she’s exhausted.“They live totally separate lives now.“Kanye has surrounded himself with a small group of people who he trusts, and that doesn’t currently include Kim or her family.“He’s paranoid and convinced he needs protection from them.”Kanye is said to be staying in Wyoming.In the tweets on Monday night, he said Kim and her mum Kris Jenner had attempted to “lock him up” with the help of a doctor.Kanye West failed to submit any of the , petition signatures required for his presidential campaign to be added to the states ballot.The deadline was on Monday, just one day after Kanye hosted a rally in South Carolina.No one associated with Wests campaign had delivered any signatures to the South Carolina Election Commission by the time the deadline passed at noon, according to the Post and Courier.Late registration is not permitted.Following an emotional few days of campaigning during which he went on a number of rants that revealed personal details about his family, Kanye West appeared to question whether  was the best time for him to make a presidential run.#vision or maybe ‘,# the rapper tweeted on Tuesday night.#I guess all black people supposed to vote on Biden  Y’all want me to run on nah   #Accompanying the tweet was a photo of an orange piece of paper bearing what appear to be song titles from his forthcoming album with some of the vowels removed, such as #WTH CHLD# AND #GOD BRTHS.#The album, Donda, is named after Wests mother and is set to be released on Friday.In his Daily Show segment on Monday night, host Trevor Noah turned his attention to Kanye Wests #new album-slash-presidential campaign.#Noah played a montage of footage from Wests first presidential campaign event, which took place in South Carolina on Sunday, that showed the rapper emotionally describing almost aborting one of his children as well as criticizing abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman for not doing enough for Black Americans.“Honestly, guys, I don’t know what to make of this,” Noah told his audience. #I feel like someone who cares about him needs to take his microphone away.

Normally Kanye is so private that he won’t let the reality show cameras film in their house and has a long list of rules around filming their children, so for him to say something so private so publicly, something is very wrong. “Originally Kim was happy that Kanye chose to go to Wyoming as he’s always calmer when he’s there.

Jonathan, who also runs four food markets, pays a total of £.million a year to landlords.Only one has offered a reduction — writing off £,, the equivalent of six months.Jonathan’s scheme has been backed by more than , pubs, bars, clubs and restaurants.It is a plan, he says, that will not cost the taxpayer a penny and will save around two million jobs.Here is how National Time Out would work:Jonathan says: “Landlords need to step in and support their tenants.“But surveys show that  per cent of landlords of hospitality premises were still expecting full payment. That is just not realistic.“Landlords need a debt repayment break, too. “Almost all of them borrow money against their buildings, andthey are giving tenants a rent break, we need to give them a debt repayment break.”His campaign group, which includes UK Burger King boss Alasdair Murdoch, celebrity chefs and thousands of owners of small businesses, has had previous success in getting the Chancellor to change the law.In March they persuaded Mr Sunak to ban landlords from evicting tenants during the coronavirus crisis.It was originally for three months but has been extended until the end of September. Jonathan says: “The Government made legislation in days from me suggesting it. “By moving quickly they gave everyone breathing space, which was fantastic.“I think the Government hoped landlords would see sense, help their tenants out and deals would get done.“But that has not happened. We need Government to push landlords to the negotiating table.“It is about tenants, landlords and bankers all sharing the pain.“It cannot all be forced on to the tenants.”Jonathan fears thata National Time Out scheme does not come, there will be a “rents Armageddon”.He says: “On October , all the landlords that are sharks and vultures will be circling around premises ready to change the locks.“If Rishi does not do something about Britain’s rent debt then  per cent of hospitality businesses will not be open and that will mean the loss of two million jobs.”The Milk  Honey landlords were unavailable for comment.PUBLICAN Debbie Lloyd owes her landlords more than £, for the  weeks of lockdown. Her Masons Arms pub in Kemberton, Shrops, is too small to reopen while social distancing rules are in place so she is still not bringing in any money.Debbie, , says: “The landlords said we would still have to pay in full and we’d have  weeks to pay back the rent arrears. They did say thatwe opened on July  they might offer us some discount.“But it’s not worth reopening the doors when I have to find rent plus arrears with only  per cent income. “It’s impossible and they have offered us no help whatsoever. So I have given them a month’s notice and stripped everything out that I paid for. But I will still owe them the rent.“I think the National Time Out campaign is a fantastic idea that would help people like me. I really hope the Government listens.”Debbie’s landlords were not available for comment.PHILIP Carter runs a sandwich shop in Catterick Garrison, in the North Yorks constituency of Chancellor Rishi Sunak.The -year-old says: “We are negotiating with the landlord to see what deal we can cut. “Some landlords have been really good and helpful while others just say a blanket ‘no’.“Tenants near us have said their landlords are not being helpful. “Businesses like ours have been closed for at least four months and we have come back to a very reduced trade. “The campaign to give tenants like us a break would help thousands.”HAIRDRESSER Dennise Smith used some of her £, coronavirus council grant to pay her rent during lockdown.Although her salon in Croydon, South London, has reopened, Dennise, , fears she may struggle to pay her £,-a-month rent as trade is so uncertain.She says: “I haven’t missed one payment in five years. We have reopened but there are so many restrictions you cannot be as busy.“I don’t think I’m going to be taking anything like the same money as I did before Covid.“Anything that could help to reduce the rent while we get up on our feet would be a boost.” As head of the National Time Out campaign Jonathan Downey explains, hundreds of small businesses are closing their doors for the last time just as punters cautiously start to .Why  Because despite being forbidden from making money during lockdown, publicans and bar owners are now expected to cough up their rental payments — ­in full — to their landlords. We know there’s no quick fix. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already been incredibly generous to the hospitality industry. But pub, restaurant and cafe owners are the beating heart of this country.

A few decades ago, we had our defences up, but now we have relaxed defences and they have fully infiltrated Britain.”The report revealed that there is “credible” evidence Russia tried to interfere in the  Scottish independence referendum to break up the UK.It states that Russian spies tried to hack the Foreign Office and Britain’s top secret lab at Porton Down, Wilts, in the wake of the Salisbury poisoning in  of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.And the Government is criticised for not investigating claims Russia tried to tamper with the  Brexit vote — with the report calling for an inquiry.Social media giants are blasted for “failing” to stop hostile states, such as Russia, from using their s to target the West.And the dossier claims the Official Secrets Act is out of date and it is not illegal to be a foreign spy in Britain.The damning -page report paints a shocking picture of the sheer scale of Moscow’s interference in Britain’s affairs.It reveals oligarchs exploited a visa scheme set up in , designed to attract investors to the UK, to live in the capital.A growing army of wealthy Russians used London to launder their dirty money.The report states: “What is now clear is that it [the visa] was in fact counter-productive, in that it offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what is referred to as the London ‘laundromat’.”Russian billionaires pumped their dodgy cash into supporting charities, galleries and political parties, the report found.They have used their phenomenal wealth to set up in business in Britain and send their children to expensive private schools.The super-rich Russians also donate to Britain’s political parties, hobnob with MPs and peers and patronise museums.The Intelligence and Security Committee report states: “A number of Members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia. These should be scrutinised.”The committee also said peers should have to declare all earnings over £, as MPs do.The members’ register shows crossbencher Lord Skidelsky is a non-executive director of Russian oil refining company Russneft.Tory Lord Fairfax of Cameron is a director of Sovcomflot UK while Labour’s Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede is a director of oil and gas firm RNG Joint Stock Company.They were helped in their “nefarious” scheme by an army of “enablers” — UK lawyers, accountants and PR execs who have cashed in on the Russian boom.The report added: “Russian influence in the UK is ‘the new normal’ and there are a lot of Russians with very close links to Mr Putin who are well integrated into the UK business and social scene, and accepted because of their wealth.”Naive ministers in successive governments “took their eye off the ball” when it came to Russia and underestimated the threat the UK was under, the dossier found.Crucial resources were erted from protecting Britain from Russia to focus on terrorism.SNP MP Stewart Hosie, a member of the committee, said the UK was “one of Russia’s top Western intelligence targets”.He added: “Russia poses an all-encompassing security threat which is fuelled by paranoia about the West and a desire to be seen as a resurgent great power. It carries out malicious cyber activity in order to assert itself aggressively, for example by attempting to interfere in the elections of other countries.”Mr Browder, a former fund manager in Russia who now campaigns against human rights abuses, wants laws to freeze the assets of Russian crooks.The PM’s spokesman said Boris Johnson is “absolutely” confident the Brexit referendum result was fair, adding: “We’ve seen no evidence of successful interference.”Kremlin-backed bots and trolls use tech companies to peddle their fake news in a war on the West.Ministers should “name and shame” Silicon Valley giants who fail to defend themselves.The report said: “Social media companies hold the key and yet are failing to play their part.“The Government must establish a protocol with the companies to ensure they take covert hostile state use of their s seriously.”HOW many wake-up calls do we need before we realise the threat posed by new authoritarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin The Russian Report is a damning document, highlighting Whitehall’s inability to counter new forms of malign state activity.The overwhelming evidence is that government failed to grip the more insidious threats linked to the Russian state with its criminality and money-laundering.The report shows our so-called Rolls-Royce Whitehall machine is more like a Skoda from the days of the Warsaw Pact.It has to change.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My sisters baby died, the funeral was very recent.”“Riley was diagnosed with ADHD just before lockdown and weve been struggling with that.”“And our baby has been diagnosed with brittle bone disease, hes broken two legs in the past six weeks.”On top of that we were all just generally getting on top of each other. Ben was sleeping downstairs because the strain was really getting to us.”“Our eldest has to sleep in what should really be the dining room, which he hates and we hate.”Now all the kids will have their own room. They are already fighting over who will get the loft room.”“Weve never really had anywhere stable. Now my two year old will grow up in a stable home. So this has completely saved our whole family.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister – who has surrounded himself with Vote Leave architects including Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove – and his Government were accused of an “astonishing lack of curiosity” over claims of Moscow meddling.But Mr Johnson has continued to resist calls for an investigation. Acting Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said Mr Johnson was giving the Russian leader president a “green light” to interfere in UK politics. Yesterday’s publication of a long-delayed Intelligence and Security Committee report warned “Russia considers the UK one of its top Western intelligence targets”.It highlighted espionage and cyber-attacks, election meddling and money laundering. The report also branded the Kremlin’s influence in the UK the “new normal” after successive governments welcomed oligarchs – giving Putin’s allies links “at the highest levels” of British public le. The committee said: “It has been clear for some time Russia has moved from potential partner to established threat, unwilling to adhere to international law. Millions of pounds have been pumped into the Tory Party by wealthy Russians. The Intelligence and Security Committee said: “Several members of the Russian elite who are closely linked to Putin are identied as being involved with charitable and or political organisations in the UK, having donated to political parties, with a public profile which positions them to assist Russian influence operations.” Lubov Chernukhin, , pictured, whose husband Vladimir is an ex Russian minister has given more than £.million to Tory coffers over the past eight years. She is a British citizen and all her political donations are legal. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. “The murder of Alexander Litvinenko and the annexation of Crimea were stark indicators. “It was the opinion of the committee that until recently the Government badly underestimated the response required to the Russia threat, and is still playing catch-up.”ISC member Stewart Hosie said the committee “found it astonishing” ministers did not try to shield the EU vote from interference or probe claims of meddling. The SNP MP said: “No one in government knewRussia interfered because they did not want to know.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she has “no objection” to an inquiry into interference in the country’s independence referendum. She added governments should not be “complacent” about possible meddling. The ISC report said: “There has been credible open source commentary suggesting that Russia undertook influence campaigns in relation to the Scottish independence referendum in .” Ms Sturgeon said an inquiry was up to the UK Government, but added she did not think the SNP’s values “could be further removed from the values that Vladimir Putin and the Russian regime stand for”. “The UK Government actively avoided looking for evidence. We were told they haven’t seen any, but that is meaninglessthey haven’t looked.” They showed a “lack of curiosity”, Mr Hosie added – especially given claims Russia tried to influence the  US presidential race and Scotland’s vote on independence in . Claims Russian actors were involved in the  EU referendum have dogged the result. Social media firms that fail to tackle the spread of disinformation should be “named and shamed”, the ISC said. “Social media companies hold the key and yet are failing to play their part,” said the committee. “The Government must seek to establish a protocol with the companies to ensure they take covert hostile state use seriously, and have clear timescales within which they commit to removing material.” Ministers said their relationship with social media giants “continues to evolve”. “In the context of the Covid- response, we are learning valuable lessons that will be applied to our future approach to countering disinformation,” the Government said. Yesterday’s heavily redacted, -page report pointed to “widespread” fears about Russian TV channels and web accounts. “Open source studies have pointed to the preponderance of pro-Brexit or anti-EU stories on RT and Sputnik, and the use of bots and trolls,” it said.Ahead of an urgent question in Parliament today, Labour ’s Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the Government had failed “on every level”, to match the “growing threat” from Russia.A furious row reignited over the delay in publishing yesterday’s report. It was drawn up by the previous ISC and sent to Boris Johnson on October . Usually they are published about  days later. This study took another nine months, with No blaming the general election, then the time needed to form a new ISC. But ISC member and Labour MP Kevan Jones blasted claims by the PM it required six weeks to get his confirmation as “categorically not true”. Former ISC chair Dominic Grieve, above, told LBC radio the delay was “inexplicable” and the reasons given by the Government were “just untrue”. Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “The report exposes deep systemic failings in the approach to security. “[It] outlines a litany of hostile state activity, from cyber-warfare, interfering in democratic processes, acts of violence on UK soil and illicit finance. “Little wonder the Government has been so keen to delay publication.” Mr Johnson marks his first anniversary in Downing Street on Friday. Peers’ links to Russian firms come under the spotlight, with the ISC warning they are vulnerable to exploitation by the Kremlin. Second jobs or lucrative directorships with Russian firms have long been seen as evidence Moscow is spreading its tentacles. The report warns: “It is notable a number of members of the House of Lords have business interests linked to Russia, or work directly for major Russian companies linked to the Russian state.These relationships should be carefully scrutinised, given the potential for the Russian state to exploit them.” It noted that MPs must register payments over £ for any work outside Parliament, but “this does not apply to the House of Lords”.Asked yesterdaythe PM believed the referendum result was “fair”, his spokesman said: “Yes. Absolutely.” The Government’s -page response tothe report said: “We have seen no evidence of successful interference in the EU referendum.”Meanwhile Russian IT businessman Aleksej Gubarev, told the High Court he was “stunned” to be linked to a US Democratic Party “hacking incident”.He is suing ex-British spy Chris Steele over a dossier alleging links between Donald Trump and Russia.The murder of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, right, whose tea was laced with deadly polonium- in a Mayfair hotel in , “demonstrated that Russia under President Putin had moved from potential partner to established threat”. The attempted murder of former double agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March  showed Russia was “flouting the most essential of international principles around the prohibition of chemical weapons”. The ISC accused Putin of “flouting UK sovereignty” and “questioned whether the intelligence community has a clear picture of how many Russians there are in the UK who are at risk”. Mr Gubarev said: “I have never been involved with the Russian federal security services or any cyber-attacks on the US Democratic Party.” aposThey focussed on the wrong question,apos says expert An expert who contributed to the report says it has too little evidence of Moscow’s meddling – because it focused “on the wrong questions”. The highly-respected specialist in Russia and its intelligence networks was one of the key witnesses. He has previously advised UK intelligence on how Russia tries to sway public affairs. He believes the report focused too much on “direct” interference such as hacking into systems, largely ignoring attempts to “influence” the UK.

The Home Secretary said the deportation and wrongful detention of people who had lived in the UK for decades after coming to the UK from Caribbean countries was “unspeakable”.She said recommendations from a damning report into the scandal would be implemented in full, including a review of the so-called hostile environment, brought in when Theresa May was Home Secretary.Speaking in the Commons, two years on from the Windrush scandal, Ms Patel said: “What happened to the Windrush generation is unspeakable and no-one with a legal right to be here should ever have been penalised. “I’ve tasked my officials to undertake a full evaluation of the compliant environment policy [hostile environment] and measures iniduallyto make sure the crucial balance is right.  “I have asked them to evaluate the changes that were made to immigration and nationality laws over successive governments to ensure that they are fit for purpose for today’s world.” All Home Office staff will have to do mandatory training to ensure they understand the UK’s history on migration and race. Ms Patel said officials must “see a face behind the case”, adding: “The injustices of Windrush did not happen because Home Office staff were bad people, but because staff themselves were caught up in a system where they did not feel they had the permission to bring personal judgment to bear.” Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds urged the government to “get a grip” on the scheme to compensate those affected by the scandal and said the review must lead to “real and lasting change”. He said: The truth is that the Government has so little trust in this area that itaposs vital that we maintain maximum scrutiny. The Black Lives Matter movement highlighted the need not just to recognise the discrimination and racism that black people continue to face, but to demand action. Looking at the failure to act on so many previous reviews, the Government is falling woefully short on that action and thataposs why we will be holding them to account for delivering the vital changes outlined in this report and to act with the urgency that is required.

Beatrice won praise for up-cycling the vintage gown worn by her beloved grandmother for a grand state dinner back in . The beautul beaded satin gown only had a few alterations to bring it into the st century, with Beatrice adding some delicate sleeves and removing the underskirts and bubble hem elements. But Beatrice isn’t the only bride to have worn a family heirloom as the “something borrowed” for their big day. Here three women reveal why they also said “I do” in their grans’ vintage frocks. Connie Bell never intended to wear her grandma’s dress. But when she took her own wedding dress to show grandma Margaret, she tried on her gran’s -year-old frock and loved it. Connie, , explains: “When Sam proposed we decided to get married quickly so we had just three months. I looked in a few local shops and picked a dress. I took it round to show my grandma and she joked, ‘Why don’t you try on my dress ’. I did and as soon as I put it on, I loved it. I’m a bit taller so I had to get the skirt ened but other than that it was perfect.” The dress was white satin with a lace overlay and when her grandma Margaret unpacked it from the box in the loft it still had petals of confetti in it from her own big day half a century before.  So Connie put aside the £, dress she had bought from a local bridal shop to wear her gran’s dress for her vintage-themed wedding ceremony, then changed into the new dress for the evening reception. Connie, from Wakefield, West Yorks, adds: “Me and my grandma are best friends so she was thrilled that I wanted to wear her dress.” Connie and Sam, , tied the knot in Harrogate on  November  –  years to the day since her grandparents Margaret and Michael wed. And Connie believes the dress and the wedding date turned into a lucky charm for them.She says: “We had been trying to get pregnant but just a few months after I wore my grandma’s dress we found out I was expecting – and the baby was due on my grandma’s birthday.” Baby Max was born the day after Connie and electrician Sam’s first wedding anniversary. Connie said of Princess Beatrice’s choice of dress: “You would expect a member of the Royal Family to have some expensive designer create a new dress. But I think it is really sweet that she didn’t.”  Bride Thursa Lamoon found her grandmother Barbara’s wedding dress stuffed in the top of a wardrobe when she and her mum were clearing out. Thursa tried the dress on just for fun – but it fit her perfectly and from then on she couldn’t imagine wearing anything  for her own wedding day to husband Jasper. The gown, made from parachute silk, is a real family heirloom having been worn by Thursa’s great aunt and grandma before she walked down the aisle.  But -year-old Thursa, from Gloucestershire, explains: “When I tried it on it was asit had been made for me – my grandma and I must have had similar figures.“My great aunt Lil was a court dressmaker and made dresses for the Royal family and she had made the dress for my grandmother’s sister and then it was passed to Barbara.“It was so well made and had really stood the test of time. I took it to a dressmaker to get it tidied up an it hardly needed anything. “I doubt I could’ve afforded to buy anything so beautul.  “It felt really magical wearing it on my own wedding day. Because my grandma had passed away it felt almost like she was with us.” Thursa and Jasper married in an outdoor ceremony in Malta in , and at first Thursa was worried that the dress would be too warm. “Because it was a beautul silk material it felt really cool and light,” she says. The couple had a special nod to Barbara and husband Clford by having a portrait of their wedding day at the reception. “I adored all the beads and, as I aged, I loved art deco and the s style.  Alison Derrick found her grandmother’s s dress in a brown paper bag when she was a child and immediately declared thatshe ever got married she would wear that dress. “I adored all the beads and, as I aged, I loved art deco and the s style,” she says. “When Robin proposed, I asked my grandmotherI could wear her dress and was so disappointed to see it looking so grey and sad.” So Alison, , enlisted the help of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum to see whether the dress could be revived.  It was lucky she did, as she says: “I took it to the VA and asked their advice, could it be washed  Thank God I didn’t DIY as they said that many of the beads were glycerine and would have collapsed! A dressmaking friend of my mother lined it and it came back to le. The silk is very fragile and the weight of the beads is signicant and they swung so perfectly when I walked.” Nana Elsie married Bob Bowman in Leeds in . Granddaughter Alison recreated her nana’s flapper-style look when she and Robin, now , got married in Kendal, Cumbria, in . Alison completed the s look with a lace headdress, silk stockings and shoes. And Nana Elsie was there – even though she couldn’t see her granddaughter wear her dress as she had sadly lost her sight. Alison says: “The dress was perfect! Every part, that it was my grandmother’s, it was so unusual and I did not waste money on something that would never be worn again – as most others.

Bettina Campolucci Bordi, , was given the devastating news that she unlikely to become a mum after she was diagnosed with polycystic oy syndrome and endometriosis. The influencer was told her chances of conceiving were non-existent while her medical conditions meant Bettina was having mood swings, gained weight, lost chunks of her hair and didnapost have a period for months on end. She said: “After five months of no period, I went to the gynaecologist and thought there would be a straightforward explanation. “I was on my own in the doctor’s office and remember bursting into tears when she told me that the chances of me having kids was non-existent. Having a baby is something we take for granted and I was only in my mid-s. “I was shocked as I thought whatever was wrong with me could be easily fixed. Bettina, who has more than , followers on her Instagram page, @bettinas_kitchen , was offered medication to manage her conditions but a baby was still not on the cards.Both Bettina and her husband had given up on the idea of having a family, but she was determined to tackle the painful symptoms of the PCOS and endometriosis so completely changed her lestyle and diet. At the time, Bettina was working in the food and beverage industry, with long hours and an unhealthy diet .  She gave up meat and all animal-derived products, only bought her goods from farmer’s markets and health shops and cooked everything at home – meaning no processed foods or nasty additives. Bettina also quit her job and started working in the wellness industry, putting together plant-based recipes and hosting cooking retreats. Seven months into her new vegan lestyle, Bettina was overjoyed when she fell pregnant. But due to her history of miscarriages, the budding mum wasn’t out of the woods just yet.  She said: “I was seven months into my new career when I found out I was pregnant. I took a test and went to the doctors. “At first I was confused, but also scared that something might happen, like a miscarriage, which I’ve had before and I was worried it would happen again. “The birth was stressful, too. Two weeks before I was due, I had a kidney infection and ended up in the hospital. They later sent me home but I was still in pain and was booked in for a doctor’s appointment - an hour later, my daughter was in my arms.”Bettina’s adorable daughter is now seven-years-old. She said: “Given my situation, we presumed it wouldnapost happen so of course, she was a hugely welcome surprise. “She is beautul, such a blessing in my le. It’s fantastic being a mum – it’s the hardest job in the world but also the most rewarding. “I do think that my lestyle change was part of why I was able to conceive, not just food-wise but it’s everything around that as well. I did a lot of research and re-educated myself on what might help. I took supplements and started exercising.

The Queen received the oath of allegiance from the newly-appointed Archbishop of York during a video call on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace said. Normally, new bishops pay homage to the Queen in person, before they begin their duties, but the coronavirus pandemic has meant the Queen has been carrying out some of her usual audiences online or on the phone.

The act of newly-appointed bishops paying homage to the sovereign dates back to the reign of Elizabeth I, and the Palace confirmed it is the first time this has happened virtually.

Sir Venki said: #xCIf you look at the situation in Scotland versus England today, the total number of cases per capita is about comparable, which means that in the early stages of the pandemic, the two countries had a very similar outcome. #xCButyou look at the infection rate today, Scotland is about  times lower than England.#xDHe added: #xCI think we could be doing more to suppress the virus more completely before we go into the winter, and that would give us much more leeway. #xC#xCIt would also make a lot of the environments safer,for example, schoolshospitals which we were worried about.#xD:Driving tests resume in England on WednesdayDriving tests restart in England on Wednesday with a huge backlog after hundreds of thousands were delayed or cancelled due to the coronavirus lockdown.

In response, local and regional authorities have imposed a string of restrictions, to the fury of some businesses which have been told to close their doors again, including cinemas, nightclubs and gyms in Barcelona. #xCWhy do we have to be closed #xD, said Oscar Simon, the head of a martial arts school, speaking at a protest by sports centre managers and workers. #xCWe cannot cope with this crisis, three more months closed will send us to our death,#xD Simon said, stressing he had spent a lot of money in protective equipment that guaranteed health standards.People enjoying the warm weather in Barcelona :Around , lives may be lost to cancer over the next five yearsAround , lives may be lost to four common cancers over the next five years due to delays in diagnosis caused by Covid-, experts have said. A drop-off in the number of people seeing their GP with symptoms, and lower referrals for scans, could result in cancer being spotted too late, according to research published in The Lancet Oncology. Even when people are referred to hospital, there are growing delays in accessing diagnostic services that could save lives, the study warned. This combined effect means there must be a rapid ramping up of NHS diagnostics to prevent further avoidable deaths.NHS figures show that , urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in May , down from , in May  - a fall of %.At the same time, , more people are now waiting to have key cancer tests in England#xs hospitals compared with the same point last year.:Coronavirus may be more severe in colder monthsCoronavirus may be more severe in colder months than warmer ones, and dry indoor air may encourage its spread, new research suggests. Severe Covid- outcomes decreased as the pandemic progressed from winter to the warmer months, analysis indicates. Experts warn that their findings paint a grim picture for the colder weather, when it is thought the disease may re-emerge.Researchers analysed data from , patients admitted to hospital with Covid- in Croatia, Spain, Italy, Finland, Poland, Germany, the UK and China. They mapped this against local temperature and estimated indoor humidity and found that severe outcomes - being taken to hospital, admittance to ICU or the need for ventilation - dropped in most European countries over the course of the pandemic, covering the transition from winter to early summer. The study, which has not been peer-reviewed, suggests there was a corresponding decrease in the rate of deaths from the disease. There was roughly a % drop in mortality for every one degree Celsius rise in temperature, the King#xs College London researchers say. By contrast, the severity of symptoms and mortality rate remained constant in China during the first wave of the pandemic, which occurred solely throughout the winter. The study also looked at data from more than , UK users of the Covid Symptom Study app reporting symptoms consistent with Covid-.:Children under  to become eligible for coronavirus testsChildren under the age of five with potential coronavirus symptoms will be able to access testing for the virus from Wednesday.

Dr Gregor Smith, interim chief medical officer, told the Scottish Government#xs coronavirus briefing: #xCWe know that young children can become infected with Covid-, but are unlikely to have severe symptoms. #xCAt the current time, the evidence suggests that it#xs very unusual for the infection to be transmitted among children, and from children to adults.#xDMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine could sped up","story":"NewsCoronavirus vaccine could be sped up for Christmas rollout, taskforce boss saysKate Bingham, chair of the Vaccines Taskforce, has said a new coronavirus vaccine could be rolled out by Christmas, bypassing the usual sign-off period of up to  monthsShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video sir-jeremy-farrar-humanity-live-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-vaccine-could-sped-up-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Claire Reynolds and Ben Binks, both , decided to go all in when they saw a detached home in Ossett, near Wakefield, as the prize in a raffle.The couple bought £ of tickets in the hopes of having a home of their own for the first time, Yorkshire Live reported.Now Claire, Ben and their three kids Alfie, , Riley,  and Hudson, two, are due to move into the £, property, which is less than  minutes from their current place. They also will pick up the keys to a plush £, Volvo SUV. The organiser of the raffle, Dale Tate, decided to put the house up for grabs having failed to find a buyer. The -year-old is overjoyed with having sold , tickets for £ each and for who won the top prize. He said: The family is the most deserving family. We met them yesterday and they have been through some pretty hard times as two of their boys have got health issues and we really couldnapost have asked for a nicer family for this to happen to. They live on a council estate and donapost own their own home so this really is just a fairytale ending. It could have been anybody but it was a family who live in Tingley which was just complete pot luck as we had zero influence. We had messages from people in America, Canada, Australia and the draw was done fairly and they are deserving winners. Mr Tate and his we Kathy endured a stressful  days while the raffle was ongoing.They were constantly responding to messages - including those from trolls which accused them of scamming people - and even poured their own money into setting up advertising posts on Facebook to make more people aware of the raffle.It was a massive risk for us because people donapost realise what goes on in the background, Mr Tate said.  We havenapost slept for a month and we have been hounded by people saying this fraud and that the house will go to my uncle or brother. We got it   but we had to shut people down and reply to everyone. It was only when people read our comments they realised that we were real people. We had to put so much work into getting the raffle into Facebook groups and we only had a limited amount of time to sell it so we had to put our own savings into Facebook advertising and that was a massive risk. Now Mr Tate is planning to buy a campervan so he can take his boys, who are two, five, seven and nine, around the UK before they embark on a new adventure in Australia. We are going to purchase a second-hand VW campervan as Iaposve always promised my kids that I will take them camping, he said.  Weaposre going to go around the UK and pull up at dferent locations and see the country for the last time. We leave in early September so weaposre going to go round and see family and say our goodbyes too.

Children under  years of agecollectively form a very small minority of our total audience, thus naturally reducing the number of interactions with staff members and hence lowering transmission risk to an absolute minimum. Please be assured that we believe this additional temporary safety measure to be no less equal to other pre-existing safety measures such as minimum height restrictions and the ability to use safety restraints.On the companyaposs Facebook page criticised the new rules, saying they were unnecessary for young kids. Sophie Gillett wrote: I don’t think my just turned  year old will keep a mask or face covering on - he lasted  seconds in the shop yesterday before he took it off. Debbie Cartwright wrote: I wonapost be visiting with my  year old whilst this policy is in place either. There is no way he would keep one on. And Laura Chapman wrote: This is an absolute joke. Will definitely not be visiting whilst these ludicrous rules are in place.  There is scientic evidence and countless studies against children and masks, and about the potential psychological impact of this on children. Shame on you gullivers world! And shame on the people supporting this! However, others said they were happy about the rules, with one person writing: We visited yesterday and my youngest just turned  never worn a mask but every time we went on a ride asked for his mask and wore it without any complaint. I work for NHS so know under s not required to wear but totally complied with Gulliveraposs requirements and had the best family day out. Highly recommend. Thanks to all the amazing Gulliveraposs staff.  Another family agreed, commenting: We went yesterday and had an amazing day. My kids werenapost bothered about wearing face masks for the rides, hands regularly washed and sanitised.  will not stop us having fun and making memories.Julie Dalton, managing director of Gulliver’s Valley Theme Park Resorts, told Sun Online Travel : Following feedback from our guests and our staff, we have introduced a system for those unable to wear face-coverings, to indicate this at the time of pre-booking."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate middleton congratulated","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton congratulated Beatrice on wedding very dferentlyPrincess Beatrice tied the knot with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in an intimate ceremony at the Royal Lodge, Windsor, with less than  guests, including the Queen -

Prince Andrewaposs eldest daughter tied the knot with property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi during an intimate ceremony on Friday at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor. The wedding was originally pencilled in for May  in a service at the Chapel Royal, at St James’s Palace, with a reception in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, but the lockdown scuppered those plans. Once restrictions were eased, it was then quickly organised on a much smaller scale - with less than  guests - before the royals head off for their annual summer holiday at the Balmoral estate. As a result, while the Queen and Prince Philip were among those on the guest list, Prince William and Kate did not attend, and neither did Prince Harry and Meghan, who are currently living in Los Angeles. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sent their congratulations to Beatrice and Edoardo privately, a source told Hello! magazine. However, no additional details were given. In contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge opted to congratulate Beatrice more publicly.Kate and William’s Kensington Royal Instagram account shared a picture with well-wishes to the newly-weds. The picture came with a caption that said: Congratulations to HRH Princess Beatrice and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi who were married in a small private ceremony at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor on Friday! Just  friends were invited to the reception following the intimate ceremony that was attended by less than  guests, including Mr Mapelli Mozziaposs son Christopher, known as Wolfie. Prince Andrew was omitted from the official photos meaning Sarah, the Duchess of York, the groom’s parents and his son did not feature either. However, Andrew was able to walk his daughter down the aisle.

Ms Samuel, , was a long-time friend of Diana and is godmother to both Prince William and George. She described how she buys aposimpossibleapos toys for the family that William then spends days attempting to put together with cautious assembling. Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making. “William then has to spend days putting together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.” Seeing William putting the toys together with dficult is an endless source of amusement for the family - especially for cheeky George. Watching William struggle to assemble the toys “makes me laugh, and it makes George laugh”, she added.Ms Samuel made the comments as she appeared on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day. Ms Samuel added that George is amazing — Heaposs funny and feisty and cheeky and God she [Diana] would have loved him so much, she said. That is heartbreaking for all of them. The podcast was released on July , on what would have been Princess Dianaaposs th birthday. Ms Samuel also said her favorite memory of the royal was her laugh.  Therapist Ms Samuel was forced to apologise on TV earlier this year as she promoted a new book on ITVaposs Lorraine.She turned the air blue and said a rude word while speaking about how people can cope while having a bad day.

Harryaposs mum Stephanie Rogers said the youngster started screaming after the accident in Exmouth in Devon and needed urgent treatment. She said: I picked him up and couldnapost see anything that could have caused it. My husband recoiled with his hand because the sand was incredibly hot. It was scorching. My husband got a shovel to have a look and it turned out there was a barbecue under there. I have no idea how long it had been there. Itaposs complete laziness and complete stupidity. There must be plenty of ways to dispose of the barbecue or take it home. Harry, of Guildford, Surrey, been playing happy as a sandboy on the beach when he trod on the hidden BBQ left by other people. He had to be rushed to hospital with second-degree burns and large blisters. His parents say he is still in a lot of pain but they hope the wounds will heal and he wonapost be scarred for le. It was awful, really awful. Iaposm a first time parent, he is my only child, and you feel completely helpless said his mum. It was just so distressing. I canapost begin to explain how gut-wrenching these cries were. So many friendly lovely people were coming up askinghe was OK. It was one of the worst things Iaposve ever experienced. The family are now pleading with beach-goers to dispose of barbecues properly. She said I donapost believe whoever did it was malicious or trying to cause harm.  Earlier this summer emergency crews across the region tackled several fires they say were caused by disposable barbecues and bonfires, despite warnings against them. A campaign to ban the sale of disposable barbecues in Dorset has gained more than ten thousand signatures. It follows the devastating fire in Wareham Forest two weeks ago which destroyed hundreds of hectares of heathland. Firefighters found disposable barbecues at the scene. In July last year another toddler was burnt in almost identical circumstances. Rudy Haslam,  months old, who tried to knock down a sandcastle on a holiday beach faced months of painful physio and could lose movement in his hands. He screamed in agony as he was horrically burnt by carelessly-discarded disposable barbeque.  Little Rudy was rushed to hospital and needed emergency treatment for more than  blisters and burns on his hands. He had tried to knock down what he thought was a sand castle on Porth Iago beach near Aberdaron, North Wales. But the aposcastleapos was in fact a crude attempt to bury the barbeque. In their hurry to get away, whoever left it there had simply scuffed and kicked sand over it. Furious dad Joe, speaking from their home in Warrington, said Rudy had aposlooked like he had put his hands in a bucket of acidapos after he was burnt by the red-hot barbie.

Meteorologist Sarah Kent warned those potentially heading away for a UK-based trip with foreign travel complicated by coronavirus that they should prepare for a “disappointing” weekend. She told The Sun that by the weekend, the UK is in the firing line of a “succession of Atlantic fronts” which iniably bring unsettled weather. Conditions on Saturday will be “very showery” with frequent wet spells expected and torrential showers and thunderstorms in the East. There will be some brighter weather in the far North East and conditions will start brightening from the West by the end of the day. There will be some light relief and sunshine in between showers on Sunday but Ms Kent advises there is a risk some of the showers could bring them thunder.Today, conditions are set to be sunny and warm for central and southern England and Wales, but cloud and rain will blight the North. From Thursday, rain and more unsettled weather will start to creep southwards. Today: Wales, southern and central England seeing further sunny, warm conditions. Further north, it will be generally cloudy with rain at times, heavy in places. A few brighter spells are possible, for example across Northern Ireland, perhaps triggering a heavy shower. Tonight: Southern areas hang onto dry weather with a few clear spells. Elsewhere often cloudy, with rain becoming more persistent and heavier through the central swathe. Mild for most parts.

The woman revealed how her “years of savings” disappeared in just  days after her son used a debit card to buy donations and subscriptions.In a Reddit post, the woman appealed for help to recoup the ,.charge after her initial efforts to get the money ed failed .  “When I saw the bank balances were almost gone, my lips started to tingle and I had to put my head down so I wouldn’t pass out,” she told Dot Esports. “I cried at first. I didn’t believe he could’ve done this.” When confronted, the son confessed to transferring her money into his own debit card account using her password, but denied knowing the full figure. Her son is said to have spent the money on the Twitch streamers Tfue, Gorb and Ewokttv.  The mum - who wants to remain anonymous- said she has reached out to her bank, Amazon and even the CEO of Twitch in a bid to get her le savings back, but is yet to hear from them. Reddit users say that many banks will refuse to pay back the money unless she takes legal action against her son.She told Dot Esports : I contacted my bank as soon as I found out and they froze all of our accounts, and his debit card was cancelled."},{"url":null,"title":"mum who gave birth coronavirus","story":"NewsMum who gave birth with coronavirus dies on ventilator after never meeting newborn babyAurora Chacon Esparza, , was given an emergency C-section at North Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn Center and gave birth to baby Andrea  weeks premature while battling Covid-ShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JUL NewsAurora and Juan with their oldest two children \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Aurora Chacon Esparza underwent an emergency C-section at North Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn Center because doctors were worried her unborn baby was not getting enough oxygen. Baby Andrea was then born  weeks premature and remains healthy, but her mum died on Sunday, according a GoFundMe page set up by her devastated family. Husband of seven years Juan Duran wrote that he and their three children will forever miss her. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. He described her as a strong, loving and caring person and said he hoped sheaposd moved on to [a] better le. Aurora began displaying Covid- symptoms in early June, including frequent coughing and breathing problems. As the -year-old mumaposs condition worsened, doctors reportedly said she needed to be put on an ECMO machine that would act as her heart and lungs. However, with NMH not an ECMO centre, she would need to be moved to another hospital - though all transfers were denied, Juan told Fox .The dad-of-three said his we was a healthy woman with no pre-existing conditions, adding: We never thought this could happen to our family. As well as Andrea, the couple shared a one-year-old son and a daughter, seven.  Initially believing Auroraaposs stay in hospital would be short, four days later when he was told about the C-section thataposs when it hit me, he explained. Referring to his baby girl, he told the news outlet: Sheaposs four pounds, two ounces now and her heart is doing great. She can breathe by herself. She eats, she smiles, she cries. North Memorial Health told Fox while it partners with local and regional healthcare systems to provide ECMO, it is a highly specialised service and not offered as a long-term or ongoing treatment which would be required to treat Covid-. It added that it is used for short-term emergency care as part of trauma and cardiovascular surgery programmes when needed, adding that stringent criteria must be met.

Access slopes at a range of buildings, including healing sanctuaries and temples, are the earliest evidence of civilisations adapting to help less-mobile citizens, said Debby Sneed. Examples date from as far back as the early th century BC – but their true purpose has not been recognised till now, she believes. Dr Sneed said that although ramps were common in Greek buildings, their presence has previously been neglected in research. They have wrongly been viewed as a “means of conveying sacricial animals”, she added, and have often been missing from building plans in scholarly articles. While the provision of access to mobility-impaired iniduals may not have been the exclusiveof these ramps, it was a primary factor in their construction, she said. She found such ramps were particularly common at healing sanctuaries, where the disabled sought help from the god of medicine, Asclepius. The Temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus had at least  stone ramps, she noted. Greece was often at war during that era and would have had many wounded soldiers, Dr Sneed wrote in a paper for Antiquity, the journal of archaeology.

Thataposs because two children who visited the Shanghai Museum of Glass broke a £, castle into pieces after chasing each other around the exhibition and climbing over the protective barrier. The Fantasy Castle is the worldaposs largest glass blown castle created by Spanish glassblower Miguel Arribas and is based on the iconic Cinderella Castle at the Walt Disney World Resort. The work weighs kg and is worth about £,, featuring spires made with -karat gold. It had taken the artist  hours to complete and used half a million glass loops, according to Manuel Arribas, co-found of the Arribas Brothers, a chain of glass and crystal shops at Disney Parks around the world. The castle had been presented to the museum in  to mark its fth anniversary but the venue announced at the weekend it had been damaged on May . It said two children visiting the museum had crossed through the belt barrier and bumped into the display while chasing one another, toppling the case and causing the castle to fall. The main spire was broken and other sections suffered ious degrees of damage - but the museum has not revealed the exact cost of the broken exhibit.The venue has contacted the artists to try and arrange for repair works, but they are unable to visit to China at present due to travel restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus crisis.Shanghai Museum of Glass urged visitors to follow the guidelines and refrain from running or crossing protective railings, and apologised to visitors who will not be able to see its collection in its entirety.

In terms of pure squad size, though, cover is needed.We’ve already seen with Siegrist, Butcher and Shankland struggling with injury how short the Terrors could be in crucial early games.A couple of extra bodies would alleviate any concerns of stling.That all but one of their under-contract first-team players accepted a wage cut is cause for optimism for Dundee.The vast majority of the squad making a salary sacrice is testament not only to the players as iniduals but to the togetherness of the club as well.It should reassure Dark Blues supporters they’ll be just fine on the pitch next season under James McPake.He’s clearly built a solid team spirit and bond – one strong enough to see them through the trials and tribulations on and off the park in the months ahead.However, the fact Kane Hemmings is the exception to the rule and could, potentially, be out the door at Dens Park is the last thing the Dee would’ve wanted.Minus the English striker, Dundee are a dferent animal. He, after all, was their marquee signing last summer.The hitman is more than just a goal-scorer, he’s their talisman. Iniably,the -year-old performs well then so do his team.Finding a replacement of his quality would be some task but Dee fans should be hoping all is not lost on No  sticking around.As a proud Scotsman it pains me to say it but Harry Kane truly is a magnicent goal-scorer.He has done it consistently for seasons now butthere was ever any doubt about his ability he has well and truly quashed that by netting his th club career goal against Newcastle on Wednesday.At just ,he stays fit, you wouldn’t bet against him topping Alan Shearer’s Premier League record and Wayne Rooney’s England total.That the Premiership is due toin two weeks and we still have arguments raging between the SFA, SPFL and its member clubs is, sadly, no surprise.Surely this should have been sorted amicably by now PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – Does Kane Hemmings have a future at Dundee and will Benjamin Siegrist be fit for United’s opener \" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – Does Kane Hemmings have a future at Dundee and will Benjamin Siegrist be fit for United’s opener # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street- embed # secretJqBekuS\" data-secret\"JqBekuS\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It had been doing tracing work for NHS England.mdash Lesley-Anne KellyJuly , Mr Swinney said: #If we find ourselves in a situation where we are not able to effectively suppress the virus, then the opening of schools is called into question.“We’re working very, very hard on all fronts to suppress the virus and to make sure we have all of the preparations in place for the restart of schools in August.”First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said all new cases are being looked into and steps taken to trace contacts and break the chains of transmission.She said she was #concerned# at reports of staff breaching social distancing guidelines, adding: “We all have to constantly remind ourselves of the importance of this in our own social interactions.”The SNP leader also addressed the rise in the number of new cases in recent days, with  new cases reported on Saturday,  on Sunday, falling to seven on Monday then rising to  on Tuesday.She said: “These figures are a sharp reminder of something that you’ve heard me say on a regular basis in Scotland – that the virus is still there.“That said, a great deal of work is being done, not least through Test and Protect, to understand all of these cases, follow up contacts of them and make sure that all necessary and appropriate steps are being taken to break the chains of transmission.”She added: “We all have a part to play in keeping this virus under control.”The Evening Express is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Evening Express from just £. a month. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Having raked in over £ billion in revenue from the industry, it’s high time that the Treasury gave back.”Plans are already under way to help the north-east move away from reliance on oil and gas, and an energy transition zone # a business park focusing on renewables # is planned for the area around Aberdeen#s new South Harbour.In response to Mr Flynn, Mr Zahawi said: #It is a manesto commitment of this Government to deliver an oil and gas sector deal.#We are working with the sector and the Minister for Energy has been engaging constantly with the sector to make sure they can actually take the opportunities that are before them in offshore wind generation and all sorts of areas.#Of course, hydrogen is going to be incredibly important to the energy White Paper we publish in the autumn.#Industry body Oil and Gas UKsaid it is in discussions with the Government over a possible deal.Stakeholder and communications director, Gareth Wynn, said: “OGUK is discussing a transformational sector deal with the UK Government. It has jobs, the supply chain and energy communities at its core and will also set out how the UK’s oil and gas industry will play its part to support a green recovery working together with Government.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Low level hedging is also proposed along Pittodrie Street to create a small planted buffer between the street and the proposed building.#The development is designed to a high quality to provide an attractive and sustainable development that will enhance the Pittodrie area.#Permission was granted by council planners, subject to a number of conditions relating to matters such as contamination, building materials and parking.The site for the development is owned by William NicolLimited, and was previously home to a since-demolished warehouse.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They were actually looking leaner because they hadn’t been doing all their power and gym work.”Trying to avoid injuries during pre-season has been key for McInnes and, despite a few knocks, in the main Aberdeen’s players have come through unscathed.Defender Mikey Devlin is the only player set to be missing at the start of the season after sustaining a hamstring injury last week.McInnes said: “It was a case of being kind to them and building them up gradually and being mindful that we didn’t want to pick up too many injuries.“In my conversations I’ve had with other managers in recent weeks, they have all faced similar situations where little aches and strains is having an impact on numbers.“That is to be expected. We were picking up little injuries in the first couple of weeks and we think that is a consequence of getting them moving again.“We are now coming out of that thankfully. We got through the game on Saturday and the numbers were looking more like it in terms of squad strength.“There is no doubt it was a balancing act.“This is the longest these boys would have had in their careers of not kicking a ball and training together.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

There are plenty of places to go and things to do to suit every budget. Here is our guide to the numerous great days out in across our region.WITH BEER gardens entering their second week of opening in Scotland and the five-mile restriction on non-essential travel lted, the country has begun to look forward to a summer of fun.While social distancing measures are still in place and it is important not to take undue risks, there are plenty of things to do safely.Zoos and animal parks around Scotland re-opened on June , and now that the five-mile restriction has eased they canwelcome visitors from near and far. Edinburgh Zoo, Five Sisters Zoo in West Lothian, Blair Drummond Safari Park in Stirling and the Highland Wildle Park in the Cairngorms National Park have all reopened, with customers asked to book in advance. Fe Zoo suffered a devastating fire just days after reopening after the Covid- lockdown, but no animals were harmed and owners have said they hope toto normality as soon as possible thanks to support and fundraising from the local community.Stately homes and gardens have also reopened, with several National Trust for Scotland properties now open to visitors.These include Culzean Castle and Country Park in Ayrshire, Threave Garden in Dumfries and Galloway, Brodie Castle’s garden and grounds, Arduaine Garden in Argyll and Crathes Castle’s garden and estate in Aberdeenshire. Historic Environment Scotland has said that it will monitor the situation and reopen properties in due course.Unstaffed outdoor sites are already open, so visitors can enjoy walks around Edinburgh’s Holyrood Park and West Lothian’s Linlithgow Peel among others.Edinburgh’s historic Royal Mile.Walkers and climbers are now welcome to visit the country’s national parks to enjoy some outdoor exercise. Guidelines remain to avoid touching surfaces or opening gates where possible, to follow signs and avoid coming into contact with farm workers where applicable, and to keep dogs on leads and avoid areas known to be busy. Pubs and restaurants without door space have also been allowed to reopen. Glasgow’s The Cranside Kitchen, near the Rotunda, has claimed to be the country’s largest beer garden, with a free-to-enter area seating more than  guests with social distancing measures in place.The beer garden offers a range of drinks alongside food from five popular Glasgow restaurants, Rioja, Halloumi, Pickled Ginger, Kilmurry  Co and La Rotunda. In Edinburgh the Corn Exchange has billed itself as the largest beer garden in the city, having transformed the car park into a space where people can enjoy drinks as well as play darts, ping-pong, swing ball and watch sport, all while observing the necessary hygiene routines. With hundreds of smaller beer gardens open around the country – including Dundee’s The Kilted Kangaroo and Aberdeen’s Siberia Bar and Hotel – there is no shortage of options for enjoying this summer safely and enjoying good times in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"when inveraray might have had a railway","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle + had a railwayviaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLetters dating back to the first half of the th century reveal that there was once a proposed railway line to Inveraray from Dalmally.Letters in the Inveraray Castle archives, housed at the estate#s Cherry Park, shed some light on why the seventh and eighth Duke of Argyll each opposed the building of this branch line across their lands.In , the seventh duke was #quite confounded at the mania of the people of Inveraray and Oban, proposing a plan of a rail road by Inveraray and Oban to all the world, to carry a few black cattle and salt herring…pray assure them of my unqualied opposition, in and out of parliament to such a wild goose plan##Lord Lorne, his son and the future eighth Duke of Argyll, was also unhappy about #this ridiculous railway scheme#.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

I dont think that we all necessarily want to wear secondhand clothes ndash I mean, I love finding a secondhand bargain somewhere its something I spend a lot of time doing ndash but a lot of people dont like that idea and the important thing is not that you wear clothes that somebody  has owned before but that the fabrics are recycled and we look at how a circular economy works in fashion.\"Ms Shulman believes very strongly that the drive for more sustainable fashion must come from the brands themselves.\"It has to be driven by the brands, the people making the clothes,\" she says.\"Theres a much harsher environment now for people who arent watching out for good practice.\"And that will extend to the production of the clothes but its not yet at a point where you have to prove that youve got a sustainable pipeline.,params: .push\"And, at the end of the day, a big driver for people is what they can afford.\"But, of course, its not only fashion fans but also book lovers who will be drawn to see Ms Shulman speak, and she talks just as passionately of her childhood love of reading as she does her favourite Chanel jackets.\"I loved reading, as a child. Loved it.

That was one of my favourite books.\"And Emil  The DetectivesI loved, as well.\"And all the schoolgirl books, like Mallory Towers... heavenly!\"If you thought the last thing Ms Shulman would have done while running one of the worlds most successful magazines was read books, she insists its important to make time for such a pursuit.\"I always used to say to people who said to me, I dont know how you have time to read, I dont have any time to read ndash you do have time to read, you just dont choose to use your time reading.\"If you really wanted to read, thats what youd do with your time.\"She adds: \"I read a lot ndash I squeeze it in.

Once the island safely reopens to tourism and visitors, it is a must-tick on any bucket list.Chanonry Point, Black IsleThis shingled beach on a narrow spit of land jutting out into the Moray Firth will delight nature lovers.Scotlands east coast is home to almost  bottlenose dolphins and here at Chanonry Point, between Fortrose and Rosemarkie on the Black Isle, is one of their favoured haunts.Even on a dreich and gloomy day, the heart soars watching the pod produce a thrilling show of acrobatics as they play and fish in the strong currents.Loch Morlich, CairngormsScotlandrsquos only freshwater beach lies on the shores of Loch Morlich, surrounded by forest and against a backdrop of the Cairngorms.The sandy bay is popular for sailing, windsurfing, paddle boarding, kayaking and canoeing.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

He would arrive for a few months in the summer, then vanish until the following year.He was always mysterious as to where he came from and where he was going. He had an accent that some said was Irish, but it was mixed with a most definite local Scots dialect. He was an old man with an unkempt beard. He always wore a bonnet a certain way, and wild strands of white hair grew from the sides of it. While he still had most of his teeth, there was one visibly missing, which was revealed when he smiled. When people asked him his name he would be reluctant to say. People called him the Porridge Maker.His most treasured possession was his cooking pot. It was large and heavy and he would carry it on his back with the help of straps he had made. He tied the lid tightly and all his other possessions would be stored in the pot. It became a kind of rucksack as he travelled.He would walk for miles, humming to himself, singing and sometimes playing his penny whistle. Then he would choose a place to settle for the night, and unpack his pot, and start cooking. He would make an evening broth from whatever he had managed to acquire during his dayrsquos travel. Then under the canopy of the stars, or under the boughs of a treeit was raining, he would wrap himself up in the thick blanket that he used during the day as a kind of jacket.Every morning he would make porridge, and always a larger amount than he would need himself. This was the time when people would enquire as to his purpose and origins. Often it was the small children of the village whose curiosity would make them assemble round him and ask questions. Sometimes they would be shooed away by their parents, but often the older members of the community who had more time would engage him in conversation, and then sit with him.The Porridge Maker had tales and riddles, news from far-flung lands and memories of past deeds and events which made his company fascinating for old and young alike. Soon it became apparent why he would make more porridge than he needed: it was to share. He would share it from his one bowl, which he called his Porridge Quaich. It would be passed round in an almost religious ceremony.But to have a taste of his delicious porridge, a price had to be paid. A story or riddle must be told, a memory shared or some wisdom imparted. The Porridge Maker would listen carefully to everything said. This was one way he gained his vast knowledge of the world and of its stories.The other was, of course, in his travels. As he walked he would observe everything: the way the clouds formed, the song of the birds, the landscape and its curiosities, the way people behaved everything. Then he would just be, and allow his thoughts and observations to mingle. This was how new tales and riddles formed in his imagination.And so as he cooked his evening meal, he would tell stories to himself and whisper his riddles, and he would look forward to sharing them with whoever might come his way and sit by his fire.Then one day, someone recognised him.The Porridge Maker had settled himself away from the road by the River Tyne, downstream from Haddington. He had made a small fire and was cooking a trout he had secretly caught when an old man of similar age walked by, stopped, stared at him, and then made his way towards him.The Porridge Maker thought he was now in trouble. But the old man wasnrsquot interested in the fish. He studied the Porridge Makerrsquos features carefully, then he nodded with a grin.ldquoAye, sae it is ye! said the man with an accusing tone.ldquoAye, fir sure I am maist certainly me! replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYe cannae bamboozle me, said the stranger with a triumphant mocking laughter, ldquoI thocht I kent ye by the way ye wear yer bonnet and by yer stooped shudder, but noo that Irsquove seen yer face I ken fir sure!ldquoAnd  asked the Porridge Maker, seemingly unfazed by this sudden attempt to unmask his identity.The stranger sat himself down and looked the Porridge Maker in the eye.ldquoI cannae mind yer exact name, he said, ldquobut I ken ye were a Jacobite.ldquoThose days are lang past noo, said the Porridge Maker, still keeping his calm.ldquoAye, they are, thankfully. And they hanged many orsquo the likes orsquo ye.ldquoThat they did, replied the Porridge Maker.ldquoYer a MacGregor, said the old man, ldquoI mind that, and ye hud blood oan yer haunds ater Prestonpans.The Porridge Maker said nothing. He just stared into his fire.ldquoYe sliced a manrsquos heid in twa by the wall.Suddenly the Porridge Maker looked up. ldquoHowrsquod ye ken that  he asked, now startled.ldquoBecause I wis there!The Porridge Maker now looked the man in the eye.The old man continued: ldquoYe were goanie dae the same tae me. I hud nae weapon sae I punched ye.ldquoAye, said the Porridge Maker, ldquoI remember that weel enough, revealing the gap in his teeth that was the result.The old man laughed.ldquoThat punch saved ma le, said the old man, ldquofir it gied me time tae run as ye stood like a stunned rabbit. But I saw ye ater, greetin like a bairn.The Porridge Maker was silent but pursed his lips and nodded.ldquoYe cudnae thole it cud ye  said the man accusingly.ldquoI wis a lad, and arsquo fired up with rage, said the Porridge Maker. ldquoHe wisnae the only one that day I killt. But I vowed he wud be the last Irsquod kill tae decorate anotherrsquos pride. He hud cried fir mercy sayin he had bairns, but I didnae understand his words till after Irsquod cut him.The old man laughed. ldquoSae much fir the great warrior race! Ye deserted after the battle, didnrsquot ye  Ye ran awa like a coward and cudnae gang hame. If the Redcoats hadnae caught ye, yer ain family wud huv disowned ye fir the coward that ye are!ldquoI did go hame after, but I found ma hoose burnt and ma we and bairns slain. Sae I hud nae family left after that time, said the Porridge Maker with a breaking voice.The old man bowed his head. ldquoAye, it wis a sair time richt enough. But the wages orsquo rebellion are unforgiving.ldquoDae ye ken the name orsquo the lad that I killt by ye  asked the Porridge Maker hopefully.The man was surprised by the question, and looked at the ground as he thought.ldquoWull I think, aye, it wis Wull. I mind he wis really feart, poor lad, he carsquod fir his mither as he died.The Porridge Maker lowered his head, reliving that moment he had tried so often to forget.Neither men had yet exchanged their names.ldquoYou hungry  asked the Porridge Maker, ldquofor ye can share whit I have ye huv earned it by sharing yer memory wi me.And so two men, who once had tried to kill each other, now shared a meal.ldquoWull, the Porridge Maker whispered as he ate.He finally had a name for the young lad hersquod slain all those years ago in  at Prestonpans.The deepest wounds of war are often those unseen, and the stories left out by military historians are the stories of lives traumatised and changed forever.Sadly, whatrsquos left of the Prestonpans battlefield site is now under threat by proposed new developments."},{"url":null,"title":"column-heyday-open-air-pools","story":"Open-air pool lidos in England are already open.If we were back in our former holiday heyday, we could offer a choice of three seaside lidos.Swimming lsquopondsrsquo at Port Seton, Dunbar and North Berwick once buzzed with summer sociability in the sun.For families, they offered entertainment, like galas, ing displays, water polo matches and midnight bathing.A fortnightrsquos lsquobucket-and-spadersquo seaside holiday drove the popularity of lidos between the wars.

family needs.After posting news of the find on social media, they were inundated by local residents eager to get their hands on one of the bricks as a reminder of Wallyfordrsquos brickmaking heyday.Matthew, who works in IT, started the garden project about a month ago on weekends and on a weekrsquos holiday as he was still working during the Covid- lockdown.Caryn said: ldquoA big shed and around  concrete slabs were taken away as we wanted to level the garden, which was on two levels.ldquoWe wanted a new patio area and walls to make it a better space for the family.They found five lsquoWallyfordrsquo bricks, one from lsquoPrestongrangersquo and dozens of lsquoGISCOLrsquo bricks, which stands for the Glasgow Iron and Steel Company .Caryn and Matthew have kept one lsquoWallyfordrsquo brick and the lsquoPrestongrangersquo brick, which will have pride of place for posterity in a new wall they are building in their garden.The rest have now been given away to neighbours as a thank you for allowing the family to borrow equipment for their gardening work and other residents who put out requests on social media, although some of the lsquoGISCOLrsquo bricks have had to be disposed off.Another two bricks indented with lsquoNiddriersquo and lsquoEdinburghrsquo were also found recently during work in a garden at Whitecraig those bricks have also found new

Over time, Wallyford bricks were used in many buildings, including at Boggs Holdings, near Pencaitland, and Wallyford Minersrsquo Institute.Located on the old brickworks site, Wallyford Industrial Estate was established by East Lothian District Council and is now run by East Lothian Council.Mr Cranston, from Jedburgh, was interested to hear about the Wallyford discovery, saying it was likely that lsquoEdinburghrsquo brick was made at Wallyfordrsquos brickworks.He said the lsquoPrestongrangersquo brick would have been made at Prestongrange at Prestonpans, which produced bricks from the s until . Niddrie also had a brickworks and the GISCOL bricks would have been manufactured in one of its many brickworks across the Central Belt.Mr Cranston, who is hoping to establish a museum dedicated to the brickmaking industry, appealed to people who discovered bricks or had other information relating to bricks to contact him via facebook scottishbrickhistory or his website scottishbrickhistoryAlister Hadden, chairman of Wallyford Community Council, said: ldquoIt is so nice to uncover a little of Wallyfordrsquos industrial heritage with this find of local bricks.ldquoThe brickworks gave employment

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-school-return-child-psychologist-reveals-three-top-tips","story":"Schools across the country are set to open from August , with scientic advice published by the Scottish Government last week saying pupils should not have to physically distance when they go back.Face coverings should not generally be needed but staff should stay two metres away from children and other staff where possible.Despite the welcome , a leading teaching union has warned ofthe emotional trauma for children ing to school after a prolonged period off, and said a phasedwould be lsquovitalrsquo for their wellbeing.Alison Murphy, Secretary of the Edinburgh Educational Institute of Scotland local association, said: ldquoChildren will need to be run through lsquoThis is where you wash your handsrsquo, lsquoThis is your bit of the playgroundrsquo, lsquoThis is how the one-way system worksrsquo and so on.ldquoYou wonrsquot be able to do that per cent of pupils are in the building on the first day.ldquoIt would be chaos - it wouldnrsquot be safe.ldquoAnd therersquos the emotional trauma - theyrsquove been away from school for months.ldquoAn adult who had been off work for four months would be entitled to a phasedand for good reasons.Schools have been closed as a result of the virusThe online tutoring service MyTutor has enlisted the advice ofDr. Shreena Ghelani ndash a senior clinical psychologist ndash about how to handle theto school.Here are her three tips:Managing worry and anxietyIf you know your child might struggle with going back to school, try developing a mental toolbox of things they can do when they are worried at school.This might include a song to sing to themselves, visualising a calm place, practising breathing techniques and identying safe staff they can tellthey begin to feel nervous during the day.Speak to your children about the impact of CoronavirusLet children know that it is likely that other families may have been impacted by the virus,whether thatrsquos keyworking parents working hard, or family bereavements.Encourage your child to be patient and kindto other children.Let you child know what they might still be expected to do ndash not hug friends, wash their hands more often, or not share toys.Donrsquot rush to get back to normal too quicklyWhen school restarts in your area, you may find that children are more tired than usual by the extra demands and sensory stimulation placed on them.Ease them back in to their routine gently and allow enough space and time in a new schedule for any hiccups so that yoursquore not having to manage too many demands.When the time comes, yoursquoll find yoursquoll feel less stressedyou know there will be bumps in the road.You can find more tips and online tutoring at MyTutor."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-parking-north-berwicks-elcho-green-put-hold","story":"East Lothian Council announced several temporary changes to the town centre last week as part of its lsquoSpaces for Peoplersquo initiative, which aims to revive towns while helping people socially distance to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Among the changes was the temporary creation of long-stay car parking spaces on North Berwicks famous Elcho Green, which overlooks the iconic West Bay.The announcement of the plans for the car park has outraged many residents in the town, who have shared their objections through a petition set up on Saturday evening in opposition to the plans.

How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections.

If you have a shady corner, make sure you plant shade tolerant options, andyou have sun trap areas, select plants that will flourish there.\"Allens top plants for a tropical sensation...Trachycarpus fortunei - a really hardy palm , this will give your garden the exotic look and feel without the need to worry about whether it will survive through winter. They are rather slow growing, ultimately reaching a height of over m after - years.Canna - any type of canna will bring large juicy leaves and exotic looking flowers in pink, orange, yellow, white or red. Some have iegated leaves such as Canna Stuttgart or Phaison.Passlora caerulea - a hardy semi-evergreen climber with the most striking flowers. This vigorous plant will cover a wall or pergola in no time.Fatsia japonica - a medium-sized evergreen shrub with palmately-lobed leaves to cm in width, and small white flowers in clusters and small black fruits.Dahlia - extravagant and flamboyant flowers, plus they flower all summer long. For drama and colour, try Karma Chocwith dark red velvety flowers, or Edwins Sunsetwith beautul vivid red flowers that almost glow.Use decor and accessories...Blend your tropical-looking plants with exotic accessories and seating to create a holiday feel. Experts at Dobbies Garden Centresoffer five design tips to help you into the holiday mood.... Go totally tropicalFill patio containers with a selection of vibrant bedding or perennial cottage garden plants for an instant display of foliage and flower colour, including Cordyline australis Peko, along with potted palms such as Phoenix canariensis, Chamaerops humilisand Trachycarpus fortunei to add height and interest and look great in groups. Position pots behind garden furniture to create the illusion that they are planted in the ground.. Create a colour popBring a brilliant burst of sunshine and add some zing to your exterior space using an eclectic array of brightly coloured pots, mixing and matching flowers in contrasting shades for maximum impact. Fun accessories will quickly brighten patios or balconies. Choose pots in vibrant primary colours, which will really pop against white or neutral backdrops.. Bring the indoors outBrighten your garden getaway by bringing houseplants outside for the day. Adding your favourite indoor orchid to a bistro table will create a tropical centrepiece - just be sure tothem to their normal home later on to ensure they dont get exposed to too much direct sunlight.An outdoor rug will instantly transform your space and offers protection to patios and decking from sun cream spillages or melting ice creams. They also help to zone an area, adding a stylish decorative touch. Day beds and hanging egg chairs are the ultimate garden getaway luxuryyou have room.. Make it magicalFor atmospheric evenings, accessorise with a iety of lanterns, fairy lights and candles to enhance the mood - it is amazing how magical a space can look at twilight. A stylish lantern, or a solar-powered string of lights draped across trees and fences will stretch out the time spent outside. Use blankets, floor cushions and chunky knit throws to keep warm and curl up under the stars.. And when the sun sets...Take the chill out of cooler evenings by investing in a practical chiminea or fire pit for your patio, adding warmth and light to extend outdoor entertaining.And think about how you are going to protect your plants during the cooler months, RHS expert Allen advises. \"As many domestic gardeners do not have the time or space to bring plants inside over winter, it is essential to protect in situ. If focusing on the tropical look, select hardy options such as trachycarpus, fatsia, eucomis, tricyrtis, schefflera and zantedeschia, which will re-emerge after winter.\"If you want to have bananas or half-hardy palms, try wrapping them throughout the winter using horticultural fleece or hessian and fill the inside with straw for extra insulation,\" she adds."},{"url":null,"title":"books-richard-holloway-finding-spirituality-godless-world","story":"Richard Holloway, the former Primus - or leader - of the Scottish Episcopal Church, may, however, have written a book which lays the first few paving stones on the path to finding some sort of spiritual meaning in a world in which God has long ago died.I had my last flash of believing in God when I was about seven. My grandmother was ill and I remember kneeling and praying at the foot of my bed for her. But even then, as a child, I knew what I was doing was ridiculous. I wouldnrsquot have understood the words ldquointerventionary God in , but I knew innately that there was no great being in the sky who was going to answer my prayers and make my grandmother better. Only science could do that.My grandmother lost her own faith after the death of her husband, but shersquod instilled in me a love for both the stories of the Bible and the poetry of it. By  Irsquod read the Bible from cover to cover. Reading it on your own - with no minister or priest to guide, or misguide, you - is perhaps the surest path to atheism. The biblical God is a monster, a Bronze Age psychopath, and the stories of the Bible are patently just that - stories. The Bible contains truth only in the way that a fairytale contains truth: therersquos wisdom and teaching there, not history or fact.The positive lesson I took from it was this:Jesus really existed then he was one of the most remarkable humans to ever live and we should all try to live by his teachings. He was no God, just a great and wise human being.I spent my twenties sneering at and hating religion. By my thirties, as I found myself growing into fatherhood, I realised that while I still had contempt for religion and faith, the lack of meaning in my le - beyond the love of my children and family - was starting to trouble me.By my forties I understood that while atheism is factually, historically, scientically the only game in town, theres something about the human mind that requires more than pure reason alone. Reason does not provide meaning. It merely explains.Reason tells me God doesnrsquot exist. But then what  Shopping, spending, consumption, gyms, acquiring more money, ambition, work, aimless travel, TV as an analgesic for the soul hellip drink, drugs, food, sex, endless bitter and dark cynicism  What replaces God in a world where God is dead  What holds the centre together Irsquove just turned , and, like most of the world amid the pandemic, my thoughts have been tinged with intimations of mortality these last few months. Then along comes this octogenarian from Glasgow called Richard Holloway and he offers a speck of hope.This is no self-help book, incidentally. This isnrsquot New Age hokum, rather the working out of a manrsquos soul,such a thing exists. Itrsquos the story of Hollowayrsquos intellectual le, its trials, its failings, and how he has come to find spiritual meaning free from the dictum of religion.I struggle to define this book - Stories We Tell Ourselves: Making Meaning in a Meaningless Universe - beyond saying that it represents a first step toward a new form of spiritual thought. Holloway, once one of our nationrsquos leading religious figures, is now ldquoa Christian without God. He does not believe in the fairytales of religion - and he especially distrusts the ldquoruthless optimism of priests and ministers, and the cost they have wrought to human happiness - but he holds the Christian message as close to his heart as any man or woman still wearing the cloth of God.ldquoI follow Jesus, he says in closing his book, ldquoetsi deus non daretur. Or to translate the Latin, ldquoasGod were not there. Science has consigned God to the grave, but we can still live the ideals of Christianity without buying into the ludicrous myths of Adam and Eve and Noahrsquos Ark.What Holloway does most powerfully is dismiss certainty in all its forms - political as well as religious. People have died for certainties, and killed for certainties, whether its how a person prays or how much power a political party has. Today, those certainties are seen rightly as ghastly jokes, absurd crimes, like the war Jonathan Swt satirically imagined in Gulliverrsquos Travels which raged between those who opened their boiled egg from the bottom or the top.We can be certain of nothing, Holloway tells us, but doubt and love. Wersquore surrounded by ldquoruthless optimists on all sides politically - leavers, remainers, Yes, No, left, right - on it goes - others demanding we see the world through their eyes only. Holloway says to hell with that. Nobody knows anything when it comes to the decisions which shape the future - wersquore all taking shots in the dark. What matters is that we acknowledge our limitations, take others into consideration when we make our choices and try to hold a sense of love in our hearts for every living creature.Holloway speaks of ldquoresolute irresolution, the necessity of holding two opposing ideas in onersquos head at the same moment - God may be dead but the message of the man called Christ matters. Most of all, he says, we must not ldquoclose our account with reality. In other words, we must never shut our minds, and think we have found the answers because we havenrsquot and never will.This is a gospel of love, and doubt, that everyone can practice - especially atheists. For that Irsquom truly grateful to Holloway for codying what Irsquove innately felt throughout my le. Itrsquos brought a flicker of light into a darkened world. Holloway brings a message of spiritual hope for all - and for that, a few hundred years ago, this very wise and very kind man would have been burned to death at the stake. That makes him a hero in my eyes, and so and I say, God bless him."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-tvs-carol-klein-shares-top-picks-longer-lasting-summer-plants","story":"Did you buy summer bedding plants months ago, when they first went on sale and panic-buying was all around If so, you might have noticed they look a little tired by now, after the baking sun we had in May followed by endless rain.But, how can you plug the gaps to bring colour into your garden thatll last until the autumn TVs Carol Klein will be offering late summer gardening inspiration to visitors of the virtual RHS Flower Show Tatton Park at Home on July , hosted on the RHS website.\"You should go for perennials, because not only will they look good right through the summer and into the autumn, but they will keep coming back every year. They are much more worth the investment. Its not worth planting bedding plants at this time of year,\" says the BBC Gardeners World regular.You can enjoy a riot of colour with late-summer flowering perennials in shades ranging from zingy yellows to scorching reds and burnt oranges, which will last into October.\"Theres a huge group of plants which are all from the States, but which we think of as common English cottage garden plants, flowering from mid-summer onwards,\" adds Klein.Here are some of her recommendations...ASTERS\"Michaelmas daisies start flowering as we go into August but then they will go right the way through,\" she says. \"Aster novi-belgii is a tough aster which never seems to get disease and is ideal.\"They can be planted in summer, where you have gaps left by early-flowering plants, and grow to around cm. They prefer sun or light shade and should be kept well watered in dry soils. They make good companions with other autumn-flowering plants, including Japanese anemones.HELENIUMS\"These plants, which are vaguely from the daisy family, are superb. If you keep on deadheading, they will flower right up to the end of September,\" says Klein. \"They are just starting to flower. My favourite is Helenium El Dorado, which produces great big golden flowers, and Sahins Early Flowerer. There are lots of traditional ones, including Moerheim Beauty with its dark, copper-red daisy-like flowers, which are also popular.\"When you deadhead, cut down to the next bud on the stem, which will then flower and you can get a show through to autumn. Lt and ide heleniums every few years, which will increase your stock, Klein adds.\"If you split them in the spring, they almost fall apart for you. We do that with ours, planting three little pieces at a time.\"RUDBECKIASRudbeckias, also known as coneflowers because their bright yellow petals hang down, emphasising the prominent dark central cone, are from the same group of North American daisies. \"Rudbeckia fulgida deemii or Goldsturm are both beautul,\" Klein enthuses.Goldsturm has such an abundance of flowers that it has an almost solid effect in the late summer border. Use the smaller ieties with fiery displays of crocosmias and red hot pokers in a border, or put them in a pot to add patio colour, around perhaps a burgundy cordyline. Taller types can be put at the back of a border, framed by late-flowering clematis.PERENNIAL SUNFLOWERThese helianthus are not like the traditional big-flowered annual we know and love, but they do make a statement and come back year after year, says Klein.\"My favourite is Lemon Queen. Its a big plant but even in a little garden, you can have a big plant for impact, that will flower into October and occasionally even further.\"It grows to around m tall, with coarse, deep green foliage and light yellow flowers cm wide, with pale yellow ray florets and a dark yellow central disk.CROCOSMIASAlso known as montbretia, crocosmias are one of the main features at the RHS Tatton show. They may have a reputation for being a bit invasive, but you can just pull up the cormsthey outgrow their space, she says.\"Id put crocosmias with any of the plants weve just mentioned. I have Crocosmia Lucer, which has just started to flower and it is taking over from big euphorbias.\"MISCANTHUSDont just consider colour when youre filling the gaps, because grasses come into their own in summer and beyond. \"Varieties like Miscanthus Flamingo are so useful because they look good now but they will have beautul plumes in September, and then you can leave them all winter for structure,\" says Klein.Many of these plants can be obtained from the nurseries who attend the RHS shows, including Bluebell Cottage Gardens , Morton Nursery , Daisy Roots , Hardys Cottage Garden Plantsand Burncoose Nurseries .For more late summer gardening inspiration, visit rhs.org.uk tattonathome"},{"url":null,"title":"five-scottish-man-made-wonders","story":"Why not use this summer as a chance to explore some of Scotlandrsquos man made wonders ndash therersquos certainly a few bucket list sights here.

Part of the allure of these raids, as I recall, is not just the trepidation of trespassing, but of taking forbidden fruit. Usually we gathered the unripe apples and stone-hard pears as ammunition for our long-running battles, rather than as a source of vitamin C. If kids ever clamber over the fence for our apples, theyrsquod be more than welcome. If they could also pick the crab apples and turn them into jam that would be appreciated.Many aspects of le are very dferent this summer from last, but one thing has not changed. Regardless of the lurgy, fruit is ripening fast on bushes and trees the high season of berries is upon us. One of the most vivid memories of our first August here was sitting in a friendrsquos summerhouse and suddenly seeing three folk emerging from the far end of their garden. Each was clutching a bowl heaped with jewel-like fruits, and as they passed it was aswersquod glimpsed the three Magi.A few days ago, we were invited into the same garden, to help ourselves to raspberries. It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew. Being allowed access to this most beautul, out of the way corner reminds me a little of The Secret Garden. That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense.

The  expiry date stickers covering earlier ones were added in the warehouses in England, by staff employed by a US company profiting from the supply of expired PPE equipment, before they were dispatched to frontline doctors in Scotland. There was no Scottish entity that re-labelled the PPE. This was a UK-wide scheme that failed to protect frontline healthcare workers.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh EH.WE have reached a dangerous juncture in the battle with Covid-. The outcome of this battle will determine whether we endure another lockdown, which would have dire consequences for the recovery of our hospitality and many other sectors of our economy which are dependent on safe personal contact.These sectors are precisely the ones which provide employment for many of our young people and they would suffer disproportionately the economic consequences of a rollback of the present freedoms or another lockdown. Yet this same demographic sector, which has the most to lose economically, is putting at risk the containment or eradication of the disease and the health of their families and friends, by their hedonistic behaviour.

Though curiously, none of this Moscow gold ever found its way into my bank account. Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state.

Though curiously, none of this Moscow gold ever found its way into my bank account. Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state.

Provost Robertson said in his opening speech that the aim was “to keep Stromness very definitely on the shopping map” and he told an old Stromness story: “Said a business man to his neighbour, ‘How’s business the day, William ’ ‘Oh,’ replied he, ‘canna compleen, canna compleen – selt a Christian Herald, changed a penny and shawn a man whar the auld kirk is.#”The week was a resounding success. All the shops decorated their windows and offered prizes and discounts. About  flags filled the street, as everyone hung out what they could find. Merriman’s electrical shop, then half-way up Porteous Brae, hooked up loudspeakers to provide music for the passers-by.Even at such short notice, Stromness managed to get the “showies” to ert to the town. There was an amusement arcade in the Transit Shed, at the top of the North Pier, and the side-shows at the Market Green even included chairoplanes.The mystery bus tour was on Tuesday. Provost Robertson had suggested that the tour might take its passengers to “parts of the mainland you have never seen since you were last carted there to a Sunday School picnic ,  or  years ago”. He urged his audience to book but, of course, this didn’t happen and only one bus was laid on. Another five had to be hurriedly brought from Wishart’s Garage.On Wednesday there were sporting competitions at Ness, which culminated in a five-a-side hockey tournament. The men’s final, won by Dounby, was described in the Orkney Herald as being played “with a speed reminiscent of ice-hockey and an enthusiasm to win that might have been more appropriate on the battlefield”.The week also held the Stromness Regatta, a Swimming Gala, a Football Tournament, the County Sheepdog Trials and a Bring and Buy Sale in the North Kirk that raised £.The week ended, as it always has, with a fancy-dress parade. The -yard long procession was led by the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and followed by hundreds of excited spectators.  spectators lined the Market Green for the judging and presentation of prizes.In , the main attraction was the Wick Girls Pipe Band but there was plenty of home- grown entertainment. Nannie Gowans organised a concert by the youth of the town in the Town Hall. When her brother Johnnie was appointed Shopping Week organiser a few years later she ably assisted him. They are still remembered in Stromness for developing a bigger programme of events and bringing in big attractions, such as tightrope walkers, motorcycle display teams and the Globe of Death.There had not been enough time to organise the suggested art exhibition for the first Shopping Week but it was there in , organised by Stanley Cursiter, in the building now occupied by the Ell  Co Café.The Swimming Gala in the harbour included a water-polo match, “…in which it was dficult to know who was playing who” and a display of water-skiing but the big event was the March of Time cavalcade organised by the Young Farmers at the Market Green, showing how farming had developed over the centuries.“First of all came cultivation, beginning with the man with the spade and pick… We saw the genuine old wooden plough of our great-grandfathers…. The lovely and lovable Clydesdales drawing the long-boarded plough and the  tractor carrying its two-furrow at the tail and jogging along with a jaunty air.Sowing, harvesting, threshing and the farmhouse kitchen went through similar progressions, all with a commentary by JGS Flett from Harray. The final scene was the farmer in his feather bed “where he rests amid all possible blessings of State and personal luxury and indulgence.”The week ended with the parade, open air dancing and the first Shopping Week fireworks: a -minute display from the Inner Holm.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

The public are being encouraged to protect public health and our precious environment.The new Scottish Outdoor Access Code advice includes reminders to:Francesca Osowska, chief executive of Scottish Natural Heritage, said: “We very much want this love affair with Scotland’s great outdoors and nature to continue. But let’s not spoil it for others. We need be kind to nature and respectful to each other by clearing up after ourselves and taking all of our litter home with us. The scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees, human waste, as well as litter, are totally unacceptable and a blight on Scotland’s reputation.”Around half of the people surveyed said that they expect to take more visits to the outdoors after lockdown than before the crisis. It is also expected that many will replace cancelled trips abroad with holidays in Scotland this year, so you may arrive somewhere to find it busier than expected. The advice from Scottish Government is to have a back-up plan, andthis happens to you, move on and find somewhere quieter and safer.All of the latest COVID- guidance can be found on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website. The website includes information about our rights and responsibilities when outdoors, as well as specic guides for a range of activities, from air and water sports, to hillwalking and wild camping.Francesca added: “If we all follow Scottish Government advice and the Scottish Outdoor Access code, we will be doing our bit to ensure that Scotland’s outdoors remains beautul and that COVID- restrictions can continue to be relaxed.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If they do not apply for a registration or stop activities, SEPA will take enforcement action which could see them subjected to fines or criminal prosecution.There is also an important role for the public, with a warning that the use of unlicensed waste collectors could result in waste contributing to fly-tipping and other illegal activity.“Don’t engage the services of people who are not authorised,” Ms Shearer explained.“Remember, services that sound too good to be true often are, and could lead to your waste being illegally fly-tipped or disposed of by other illegitimate means.“Anyone offering to take your waste away should be able to provide a waste carrier registration number and tell you the named facility they will take the waste to –they can’t provide this information, don’t allow them to take your waste.“Now more than ever, Scots are recognising the importance of local services like recycling and the part we all play in correctly managing our waste. You have the responsibility to take care of your waste andwe trace it back to you we can take enforcement action against you too. We don’t want people to be put in that situation so make sure that anyone who takes your waste for disposal is properly accredited.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We want to help them keep it up.“These survey results and the enthusiastic response to the Make Space for Nature campaign gives us confidence that Scotland is well placed to reverse the decline in ersity of animal and plant species in Scotland. As the need for nature is ever more apparent, the way Scotland recovers from COVID- could be one important way we secure a nature rich future for generations to come.”SNH is keen to encourage and support people to develop their interest, learn more and get involved in nature.

But it is a start, and for many youngsters stuck at home for months it will represent another big step towards normality.The lack of social interaction has been one of the big psychological burdens enforced by Covid-.As we continue to move through the lockdown route map, let#s hope that when sports like shinty do eventuallythey are embraced with gusto by players – and their communities – as never before.Research, commissioned by Skye Connect and carried out by Glasgow Caledonian University, revealed that in the year before Covid- visitors to Skye brought £ million to the economy, and helped support , jobs.But Professor John Lennon, Director of the Moffat Centre for Travel and Tourism and the lead author of the report, also had a warning.“Skye is highly vulnerable to the downturn in international visitors that will continue for much of  and beyond,” he said.“Restrictions on access and reduction in air connectivity will impact on visitation.“The island does benefit from direct road access which will hopefully help catalyse greater domestic visitation – which is likely to characterise visitation for the remainder of the year.”In short Skye, and by extension the wider west Highlands, needs tourists and the region’s economy would collapse without them.But as many former industrialised parts of the country would confirm – over-reliance on a single sector can also carry signicant risk.In future years this area will need alternatives.We might also need to question the type of tourism which has come to characterise the region, and ask whether all the benefits are being as widely shared as they could be.To use one obvious example, many of those heading north and west in the weeks ahead will be coming to stay in houses – perhaps rented at upwards of £ a week – that are owned by people who live hundreds of miles away.Meanwhile, small hotels, guest houses and BBs – which provide local employment – are considering closing their doors as they find the burden of Covid-related regulations simply too onerous to make their business viable for the year ahead.If, as seems likely, Covid- accelerates an existing trend for visitors to seek self catering, rather than serviced accommodation, then the question of who benefits is worth scrutiny.A chalet on the bottom of the croft, put in to supplement modest family income, means money flows into the local economy.Houses hoovered up by letting companies, or let for  weeks of the year by someone who might visit for the other two, results in money flowing out, while the availablity and affordability of housing is limited further.In the most dficult of years all those involved in the local tourist trade deserve good wishes for the weeks and months ahead.But let’s hope there are lessons to be heeded for the future.As SkyeConnect’s project manager, Alistair Danter said this week: “We need to reset and reshape tourism for the new world and encourage a more sustainable approach that provides visitors with an immersive experience while ensuring that the island and its communities see the benefits of a tourism economy.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine publishes the text for Ruairidh‘s “Letter to Gaelic Learners” on BBC Radio nan Gàidheal .

Bha athair, air an robh Raibeart mar ainm cuideachd, na mhaighstir-sgoile anns a’ Cheannmhor aig ceann an ear Loch Tatha. An dèidh dha sgoil athar fhàgail, chaidh Raibeart don oilthigh, an toiseach ann an Dùn Èideann, agus an uair sin ann an Cill Rìmhinn. Thàinig e a-mach mar sgoilear air leth de Sheann Ghreugais agus Laidinn.Bha Armstrong a-nise deiseil airson a bhith na mhinistear, agus chaidh e cho fada ʼs gun do dh’fhoillsich e dà shearmon. Ge-tà, an àite a bhith a’ cur a-staigh airson a bhith na mhinistear paraiste, dh’fhalbh e a Lunnainn. Bha e airson sgoil a chur air dòigh, anns am biodh e ag oideachadh mic dhaoin-uaisle.Fhad ʼs a bha Raibeart ann an Lunnainn, chuala e gun robh Comunn Gàidhealach na h-Alba – The Highland Society of Scotland – am beachd faclair Gàidhlig a chur ri chèile. Bha iad air triùir sgoilearan fhastadh airson na h-obrach. Uill, bha ar laoch, Raibeart, dhen bheachd gun dèanadh esan faclair a cheart cho math, agus a cheart cho luath, riutha.Bha e trang leis an obair làitheil aige, agus cha robh cus ùine aige airson faclair a chur ri chèile. Ach, a dh’aindeoin sin, rinn e adhartas math. Ge-tà, nuair a bha e air a dhol cho fada ris an litir ‘M’, chaidh togalach an fhoillsicheir a losgadh gu làr. B’ fheudar do Raibeart an obair aige a thòiseachadh às ùr.Bha e gu math dìcheallach, agus chaidh am faclair aige fhoillseachadh ann an ochd ceud deug, fichead ʼs a còig . Agus ciamar a bha dol don triùir sgoilearan aig Comunn Gàidhealach na h-Alba  Obh obh … bha trì bliadhna eile gu bhith ann mus nochdadh am faclair acasan!Bha fèill air faclair Armstrong, a rèir choltais. Bha e gu math mòr. Bha còrr is mìle duilleag ann. Bha caibideil ann mu ghràmar na Gàidhlig. Agus b’ e a’ chiad fhaclair Gàidhlig a thug sùil air bunachas fhaclan.Sgrìobh an Literary Gazette gum bu chòir don a h-uile cànanaiche anns an Roinn Eòrpa lethbhreac fhaighinn, oir bha Armstrong air a shùil a thoirt air seachdad cànan, agus mar sin gun robh an obair aige airidh air moladh mòr. Sgrìobh an Athenaeum gun robh e na b’ fheàrr na faclair sam bith eile a bhuineadh do na cànanan Ceilteach. Agus chaidh Armstrong ainmeachadh mar am Faclairiche Gàidhlig Rìoghail do Rìgh Seòras IV dhan robh an leabhar aige air ainmeachadh.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin .

Inner Wheel has Clubs right across the island of Ireland including in Ballymena. The local Club recently celebrated its th anniversary, Patricia has been involved in her local Club for around  years and, most recently, was Club President. Patricia said: “It is an immense honour to have the opportunity to lead our organisation. Although somewhat daunted by the responsibility which comes with the role of Chair I am nonetheless excited by the prospect for the year ahead. “The ongoing global pandemic undoubtedly brings enormous challenges for our organisation but by embracing the opportunities which technology offers there are ways in which we can keep the spirit of Inner Wheel alive. “I am immensely encouraged by the way in which our members have already adapted to the new normality. The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months. She is planning to attend the International Inner Wheel Convention in Japur in India next Spring – subject, of course, to easing of travel restrictions. In the meantime she is planning a busy year of events – both ‘virtual’ and ‘physical’ - so that members can continue to give Service while enjoying Friendship. Inner Wheel is an international women’s organisation with over  members in over  countries. It is one of the largest women’s service voluntary organisations in the world.

He was speaking during a visit to a newly established Contact Tracing Centre in Ballymena.The new centre, which opened at the start of the month, is an important part of the wider Test, Trace, Protect programme managed by the Public Health Agency. Speaking during the visit the Health Minister said: “Test, Trace and Protect has a vital role to play in helping us move forward into recovery. This, along with other key public health measures, such as social distancing and ensuring good hand and respiratory hygiene, will help us to reduce community transmission of Covid-.“For Test, Trace and Protect to work, everyone in Northern Ireland must prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and be tested to help protect ourselves, our families and our communities.”The Minister added: “This is likely to become part of everyday le for the foreseeable future until an effective vaccine for Covid- is developed and a vaccination programme delivered.”Olive MacLeod, Interim Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, said: “The initial pilot phase of Covid- contact tracing began in Northern Ireland on  April and as of  May we have been tracing all positive cases. Northern Ireland was the first part of the UK to have this service established and operational. “Our contact tracing team is made up of trained staff who contact the person who has tested positive identy those people with whom they have had close contact and could be at risk of developing Covid- and in turn contact them to advise them on the appropriate next steps.”Mrs MacLeod concluded: “By this stage most people will be aware of Covid- symptoms which are a high temperature a new, continuous cough or a new loss of or change in sense of smell or taste. But people should also be aware thatthey develop any of these symptoms they should get tested for Covid-.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

A further £m has been secured for the grant this time around and only new applicants can apply.Mid Ulster Football League Division One side Annalong FC in Co Down was one of the sports clubs that did not receive support in April.Irwyn McKibbin from the club said they will be submitting an application for the fund and hopes they have better luck this time around. It will be big boost because one of our big fundraisers which takes place every year on the last Saturday of July - the Andrew Burden Memorial Bike Ride - has been cancelled due to the pandemic, he explained.Cycling Ireland won#t sanction it so we can#t do it and we#re losing out because it is the main money spinner for the club.Mr McKibbin added that it costs between £, and £, to run Annalong FC every year but felt more could have been done to support grassroots football during the crisis.Nobody is actually thinking of clubs like ourselves, said Mr McKibbin. There#s not enough thought going into it. They#re talking about Irish League clubs and Intermediate League clubs having it tight. The clubs that play on council facilities are fine becausethe football starts tomorrow they can walk into a council facility with the pitch, the changing rooms and the nets are up but we have to do that ourselves.Commenting on the reopening of the Sport Hardship Fund, Ms Ni Chuilin said it was important to support the sports sector so they can be ready to welcome players and fans back.This reopening of this fund will help those clubs who were unable to apply during the initial funding round and will also help clubs to deal with the social distancing and PPE [personal protection equipment] measures they now have to put in place, she added.Sport NI#s Ms McKeown stated that the fund is critical to helping sports clubs survive.Clubs are at the heart of our communities, as we have seen in their valued community response to the Covid- crisis, she said. Clubs are also central in helping our society emerge and strive once the current lockdown phase ends. We will continue to lead and support clubs to connect and include all people, to give us a sense of belonging and wellbeing in our communities through sport. The fund will close for completed applications at pm on Wednesday, August .Belfast Most ReadNI woman with coronavirus Clionagh Lynch fears she could have her first child without husband being thereHow many would be willing to shell out £m on NI home  You#d be surprised...Heartbroken Co Antrim widow recalls final moments with husband who died hours after first walk at end of weeks of shieldingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and two new Covid- cases confirmedConfusion over Executive rules on foreign trips as MLA cancels holiday to Italy after backlash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The new commissioner will likely investigate complaints concerning the attendance of some Sinn Fein MLAs at Bobby Storey#s funeral.When asked to formally table the motion approving Mr Kennedy#s appointment yesterday, UUP MLA Robbie Butler, speaking on behalf of the Assembly Commission, said it would not be moved at that time. No reason was provided, and MLAs moved on to the next item of business on the day#s agenda.Stormont has been without an Assembly Commissioner for Standards since September , when Douglas Bain#s term in office ended.He had been in post for five years. A replacement was not appointed during the suspension of devolution.Mr Kennedy, a qualied solicitor for  years, is an expert on commercial law. Since retiring from his job, the married father of three has taken on a range of other roles, including membership of the Veterans# Advisory and Pensions Committee for Northern Ireland and voluntary work with a local homeless charity.In the Assembly#s first statement on the matter, a spokeswoman said yesterday: While it was the Assembly Commission#s intention to debate the motion to appoint a Commissioner for Standards today the process has now been paused.The second statement, announcing Mr Kennedy#s withdrawal from the process, means that the other applicants will now likely be considered.The absence of an Assembly Standards Commissioner has been highlighted in recent weeks. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has called on Deputy First Minister, Michelle O#Neill, to report herself to the Assembly standards authorities.Earlier this month, Mr Bain told the BBC that it was frankly ridiculous that the public could make a complaint about Ms O#Neill or any other MLA, but nothing could happen as the post remained unfilled.A new commissioner will likely be able to retrospectively investigate complaints lodged against MLAs before his or her term begins, so long as those complaints were made within six months of the alleged breach of the code.It is understood that there is an extensive backlog of complaints which have come in over the past three years.Belfast Most ReadNI woman with coronavirus Clionagh Lynch fears she could have her first child without husband being thereHow many would be willing to shell out £m on NI home  You#d be surprised...Heartbroken Co Antrim widow recalls final moments with husband who died hours after first walk at end of weeks of shieldingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and two new Covid- cases confirmedConfusion over Executive rules on foreign trips as MLA cancels holiday to Italy after backlash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was a late invitation so I hadn#t much time to buy a dress and I just couldn#t find anything. Eventually I saw this dress but it was quite expensive, over £. It fitted like a glove and I felt like a princess in it. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was meant to be and nothing  compared. My lovely parents splashed out and bought it for me, I was that desperate.At the formal my friend accidentally knocked over a candle and a flame flared up. Everyone jumped back and I caught my dress on something and ripped the netting.Later on I brought the dress to a dressmaker to have it repaired. She was to send away for some material to fix it but somehow time went by and I never picked it up. I lost touch with the dressmaker, so I suppose she eventually had a clear out and gave the dress to charity.She thought that was the end of it - until recently dropping into the Cancer Focus shop in Newtownstewart. There hanging up was my dress with a price tag of £ on it. Apparently it had just been donated, she explained.I recognised it straight away because the tear is still in it. I was totally amazed.Rachael was delighted to get the dress back to keep for its sentimental value. It#s still torn and damaged and it#s a size , so it doesn#t fit me anymore, but I love having it as a reminder of my granny, she added.

Between  and , the victim was subjected to malicious reports, covert filming and a listening device, and her medical records were illegally accessed in a hospital.Alwyn Mageeand Marie Lindsayboth of Hillview Park, Enniskillen, admitted making  reports to police, the NSPCC and the victim#s workplace superiors.In addition, Magee abused his position as a member of staff at South West Acute Hospital to access confidential medical details of the victim and her family, and planted the listening device.Neither defendant appeared for sentencing, but the victim joined by video link from her solicitor#s office, with District Judge Eamon King remarking it was ironic she was present but her persecutors were not.Enniskillen Magistrates Court, sitting in Dungannon, heard the victim and Magee had a child together but separated in . He he had custody two weekends a month, and several afternoons a week.Harassment commenced the following year, with the victim hounded by both Magee and his partner, Lindsay.During this, he made  covert recordings, two of which involved him questioning the child on the victim#s movements.In , the victim discovered a listening device in the child#s schoolbag, which forensic examination established was activated by dialling a number to listen in. Calls were traced to Lindsay#s phone on  occasions, lasting a total of five hours  minutes.During interview Magee denied any knowledge of this until presented with telephone records. He and Lindsay maintained they were concerned for the child#s safety but it emerged he had custody on some of the dates the device activated.However, harassment was well under way long before this. Lindsay had anonymously contacted the NSPCC alleging the victim was physically and emotionally abusing the child, which was fully investigated and dismissed. An allegation of a fraud was also untrue, as were numerous reports to police.Lindsay fabricated complaints to the victim#s workplace manager, and during one stated she would let the community know.For several months in , Magee and Lindsay drove past the victim#s home at the same time every Sunday.A tablet owned by the defendants was found to contain recordings of the victim in her workplace.The offences specic to Magee, involved him accessing the personal medical records of the victim and her family, while he worked as a hospital laboratory assistant. The Western Trust launched an investigation and disciplinary proceedings, but Magee resigned before these were completed.The prosecutor referred the court to a heartfelt victim impact statement. She has had a particularly dficult time as a result of the defendants# actions.A defence solicitor stated his clients have expressed a desire to apologise for their behaviour.Judge King said: In all my years as a judge I have yet to hear such a catalogue of harassment by two iniduals against another person… it beggars belief. Prison is the only sentence and it#s on the cusp of immediate custody.Both were sentenced to five months imprisonment suspended for three years, and placed under Restraining Order for the same duration.

Two companies based in the city have told the Derry News that the primary cause for concern amongst customers is the virus but also the impact of Brexit. Irvine Moving Solutions has been operational for over  years and specialises in international removals. They have relocated schools and colleges, moved homes all over Europe and government employees to European Parliament in Brussels, London, Dublin and Belfast. Director, Kevin Irvine, said there has been a  per cent rise in people leaving England, particularly the south in areas like London. googletag.cmd.push On average ten families a week are ing from England, he added. They’ve moved people back to Derry, Donegal, Belfast, as well as Limerick, Cork, Galway and Dublin. Reasons are mixed but ‘most’ are saying it’s because of the Coronavirus pandemic and the high death rate with people feeling that the British government mishandled the crisis. “People believe it would be better tohome. Other customers are from England who are moving to Donegal because they believe it’s a better way of le. “We’ve also done a couple of big moves from America, places like Texas and Minnesota, and Canada. googletag.cmd.push There are retirees moving back to Donegal. They made the decision around March because they didn’t like the way the US was dealing with it too. “Everybody is coming out with the same answer.” He continued: “Some of these people have been away for over  years. “They’re moving from properties worth half a million pounds or a million pounds and purchasing one for pound, here. “That is also kickstarting the housing market too with cash buyers coming back.” Middle aged couples are relocating, he said, because of the dference in terms of cost of living and childcare. HIGH DEMAND Director and Operations Manager at Foyle International Removals and Storage Ltd, Bernard McGowan echoed those assertions. The Campsie based company is a well-known local and International mover and storer. He said the removal market between the UK and Ireland has been ‘very busy’ since the UK housing market was reopened again in early June. Mr McGowan commented: “We have experienced a high demand for our service. “We offer an already weekly UK London service and every customer we’ve spoken to recently says they are worried about two main issues and want moved ASAP to be resettled. “The main concern is a second wave of the awful pandemic. “The other major concern of people contacting us is now that the UK has left the EU can we still move them for example a cross the border or other European destinations, the answer is yes as we have all our national and international operators licences in place to have your home, office or business moved across the Border or across Ireland UK or Europe. “We have done all we can and hope all governments in London, Dublin and Europe do all they can to support Businesses and people.” The company has sought to allay any customer concerns and assured them that staff have taken every precautionary measure, including the use of responsibly sourced PPE. Customers are either not present during the move or leave instructions or simply stay in a safe area out of the way. Vehicles are also sanitised after each move and on a weekly basis deep cleaned for customer peace of mind.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Coronavirus pandemic has been tough on local businesses and news that Eason closed in Foyleside came as a blow to the city centre. There are however independent businesses who despite the current economic uncertainty are branching out and creating employment in the city. Much loved food truck and eatery Pyke ‘N’ Pommes revealed on social media that it is about to take over a new unit – at the old Primrose cafeacute on the Strand Road. googletag.cmd.push An exciting new project, BROslashN, has also been announced at recently vacated premises on Bishop Street which will house a coffee bar, barista school, restaurant and cocktail bar with locally sourced beer and spirits. Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The first threat came in the rise of out of town shopping centres. I can remember the campaigns fought against them in Derry by local city centre retailers who argued it would suck the le out of the city centre. This battle to stop planning being granted for out of town centres was largely lost and we only have to look at Crescent Link to see the impact its had on retail footfall in the city centre. Then we had the advent of online retail which began nibbling at retail sales about  years ago. googletag.cmd.push This nibble has now become a feast. Prior to Covid-, online retail was certainly taking a big chunk out of disposable income. For anyone under  purchasing online from eBay Amazon and using PayPal was as normal as going up the town. Buying clothes, electronics, games etc on your phone for younger people was the norm rather than the exception. With Covid-, however, online retail has reached into every age group. With shops closed and fear of infection particularly amongst older people the rush online has been music to the ears of companies like Amazon. For Derry city, the problem is amplied. googletag.cmd.push Derry suffers from having an already dficult retail situation. We have the highest level of welfare dependency in the North and still rank the highest in any UK deprivation statistics. We also have the highest level of unemployment in the  council areas. This in turn means less disposable income for the local population so retailers have to compete for a smaller amount of money available. Our city centre is beautul but it really needs huge investment made. Carlisle Roadhas a few vacant sites and a number of vacant shops and really could benefit from some redevelopment.  There is a plethora of charity and pound shops which provide valuable employment and services to the most vulnerable but they also tell a story about our city and its spending power.  And when you see a landmark building like the Austin’s Building boarded up and the old Poundstretchers site on Bishop Street still not developed, it really doesnt bode well. And lets not even talk about the view from the Peace Bridge into Foyle Street which shows buildings with weeds growing out the windows. I could go on, but the city centre has been on a slow decline for the last  years and the financial crisis of  has really accelerated it. If there is not urgent action taken now and led by Derry and Strabane District Council, we might not have a city centre in . So how do we reimagine our city centre   Well one thing for sure is the recent announcement by DCSDC that a shortfall in their budget might have to be met with a -year double digits rates increase is not the answer. Such a move, in my opinion, would completely kill business owners operating in the city centre. And remember having a vibrant city centre is what drives tourism. It also drives student numbers. Students and tourists will only come to Derry is it is vibrant and safe. If we allow it to die then we kill tourism. We have to be very careful of what we do in the next  years. So, what could a post Covid- Derry city centre look like  For starters, I think we definitely need more outside space offered to shops and retailers. The whole vibe seems to be al fresco which is driven mainly by the belief that its harder to catch the virus outside. It also helps solve the capacity issue for many pubs restaurants etc. Of course, in continental Europe it rains a lot less but in Holland it rains  days a year and they have a lot more outside space use than us. Ive been to Liverpoola few times and they have as much rain as us but definitely more outside space.  I just hope council dont charge rates for this space. If we want people back to work and businesses generating profits to afford rates, we shouldnt overload their rates bills. I would also seriously look at taking traffic out of the city centre and creating a huge pedestrian zone from the top of Bishop Street straight down to the River Foyle. I would also pedestrianize from the bottom of Carlisle Road right up and including the whole of the Walled City.I would allow a bike lane. Post Covid-, people will want physical distance and what better way to do it than take traffic out all together from the city centre. Data from Living Streets suggests where the pedestrian experience has been improved, footfall has increased between  and %. Bear in mind there has been a % decline in footfall on the high street across the UK between  and . In Leicester for example, shop vacancy rates were five times higher on streets with higher levels of traffic and turnover in pedestrianised areas generally outperforms non pedestrian areas . Bear in mind that a report done by Sustrans titled ‘Bike Le ’ found that % of residents living in  UK citieswere keen to see more space made available on their high streets for people socialising cycling and walking. This was before Covid- and I would guess the % in now higher. Council government really need to look at the whole business rates issue and attempt to rebalance it. Some work is already being done on this and I know the Minister for Finance Connor Murphy is looking to launch something soon. Derry, however, should look at a scheme to encourage new businesses to take up space which includes a rates free period. We need to encourage new businesses to locate into the city centre. Ebrington is another exciting addition to the solution. We can expand the city centre across into Ebrington where there is plenty of outside space. We should also utilise the Guildhall Square on a permanent basis and its a perfect link to Ebrington. We really need to imagine a new city centre with many uses. We need to also develop more markets across the city. Markets bring football and offer small producers a change to sell their products. Covid offers many opportunities as well as challenges. During lockdown we saw a huge increase in the number of people working from home and living locally. Its likely that there will be less commuting to larger towns and cities so people will be spending more time in their immediate local area. Its up to us now to design a new city centre which meets the needs of people. The new high street city centre cant only be about retail. To think this way would be to ignore the clear trends in consumer behaviour and online retail. Sustans, an organisation which has researched this widely, said in a recent report: Re-establishing the role of the high streets as a hub for social connection and reinforcing and celebrating its roots and unique character could go a long way to encourage people to stay local and spend their money where they live. I would go further than that and suggest it could also attract the visitors and students Derry needs to become the vibrant city it aspires too. We need to reimagine our city centre. We have to repurpose large buildings for new uses and also consider housing provision as well. Public spaces like the Guildhall Squareneed remodelling to make more room for meeting, eating and retail.  All of this might mean changing rules in relation to the use of public space and licensing arrangements but we really have to change before our city centre dies. In summary, the current city centre isnt thriving and hasnt for  years. Consumer behaviour, out-of-town retail, online shopping and now Covid- have each had an impact. Its now time to tear the rule book up and imagine the city centre we want for the next  years and the reality is that it will be less about retail and more about making them somewhere where people want to be. It needs to be accessible fun and an exciting development. Lets hope our council appoint the right experts and design team who can hopefully create and enhance our city centre for social and civic use.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a statement, they said: Testing and contact tracing is being conducted to identy people who may be potentially affected to help prevent any further spread. With lockdown restrictions being eased this type of occurrence is to be expected, which is why the Test, Trace and Protect programme is in place. At present anyone who tests positive for COVID- in Northern Ireland will be contacted by the contact tracing team to be given advice on what to do about managing symptoms and of the need to self-isolate to prevent any wider spread of the virus. googletag.cmd.push They will also be asked who they have been in contact with so that we can follow up with those iniduals to give them advice to help prevent the further spread of infection. Contact tracing is an established method to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-, and we are using this approach to target potential clusters which could spark new outbreaks. Limavady councillor, James McCorkell, appealed for people not to panic, and to co-operate with the contact tracing teamthey are contacted. This highlights the fact that we are by no means over this troubling time and people must take this serious when out and about, he said. googletag.cmd.push I would ask that people dont panic - the Test Trace  Protect system is there to help identy these pockets that will inevitably flare up whilst we continue to go through this pandemic. I would appeal for people to cooperate with the Contact Tracing Team, should they be contacted, as this will help get any clusters under control on the area. Please also ensure you know the symptoms of covid- and take every precaution when out and about to social distance and follow at the guidance the Government has asked us to follow. If the team identies a potential cluster or outbreak this will be reported through the PHA’s normal outbreak management channels and the appropriate infection control advice actions carried out. PHA will continue to monitor all cases of COVID-, look for trends and linked cases and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. We will not comment on inidual cases as this could lead to people being identied and deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested. We would ask everyone to be mindful of this risk. This virus has the potential to make its presence felt in any district. Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in their neighbourhood right now. That’s why following the public health advice on regular hand washing and maintaining a social distance of two metres remains vitally important. We must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bridewell, Magherafelt, Ranfurly House, Dungannon and The Burnavon in Cookstown will light up red and white, the Council colours, over the weekend Friday  to Sunday  July. It comes after a motion, proposed by Deputy Chair, Meta Graham, at the council’s monthly meeting, received unanimous support. Cllr Graham wanted to publicly convey the council’s thanks to the workers who worked tirelessly outside the spotlight during the pandemic. “We all clapped deservedly week after week for our remarkable and brave NHS to show our support and to thank them for the sacrices they made during this dficult time,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “However, I think our thanks and appreciation need to be extended further to include all of those who are sometimes overlooked and quite often taken for granted. Cllr Meta Graham proposed the motion. “We all need to pause and remember that while we may not have had everything we wanted during this crisis, thanks to the work of these dedicated workers, we certainly had everything we needed. “This gesture is a small token of our gratitude, appreciation and thanks to all those who have so selflessly kept Mid Ulster going over the last  months, often at considerable risk to themselves. We owe you all a great debt.” googletag.cmd.push Farmers, factory workers, delivery drivers, lorry drivers, postal workers, retail workers, the PSNI, the NIFRS, small local shops, council staff, volunteers and community groups were among those included by Cllr Graham.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old passed away at his family home in the seaside town on Saturday night, causing widespread shock throughout the community. Fr Ciaran Dallat, who has known the McQuillan family for a number of years, told the congregation to treasure their memories of the popular young man. “You can rejoice in the  years that Michael has been with us,” he said. “Smicko’, for the lads over there, and wee Michael for most of his family, had a great way of gathering people around him. googletag.cmd.push “I know, in the midst of the fun, there was devilment, but wasn’t that what you liked about him  You didn’t know what was coming next, sometimes. “Each of you have your own stories and I’m sure most of the memories you had were good, but suddenly, in the space of a few days, they have become treasured.” Michael in action for his club, Eoghan Rua. Michael was a dual player for local GAA club Eoghan Rua, who have organised a memory box full of photographs and notes to be presented to his family. Fr Dallat said the support of the GAA community had ‘meant so much’ to Michael’s family. googletag.cmd.push “It’s obvious there just how much sport, and the lads and lassies involved, meant to him,” he said. “It meant so much to Margaret, Paul and Joseph this week, just to have them standing alongside them. “That’s what they were doing out there, just standing alongside people who they love and care for and saying, ‘we don’t know what to do here, but we’re going to stand alongside you anyway’. “That, in itself, is beautul, and it’s because Michael gathered people around him.” Michael’s ability to gather people around him formed a central part of Fr Dallat’s homily, and he spoke of how he was always able to make those around him feel ‘important’. “We have been blessed. It has been a joy to know him,” he told the congregation. “You only had to pass through the house over the last few days to see the love that this wee man has engendered in the time he has been with us. Eoghan Rua have arranged for a memory box to be presented to Michaels family. “Michael had some experience as a classroom assistant in Downpatrick, and the children loved him. He had an ability with children to gather them around and make them feel important. “The same is true here in Portstewart. It wasn’t only his peers he knew how to take care of and bring into the centre of the craic, but that was a gt as well.” Fr Dallat concluded by asking those who loved him to remember Michael for the joy he brought to others. “There are photographs and there are memories, but unfortunately, he won’t bound back into the house once more, looking for money to put petrol in the car for the next bit of the journey,” he said. “He was a man, who though small in stature, always dreamed big. He was someone who drew the love out of others. “Whatever name you have known him by, think for a moment about your favourite memory and thank God for the smile he has put on your face and for the love he has put in your heart.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year, the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School because of the low number of pupils at the school. Groarty is the only integrated school on Derrys cityside. The proposal has now been agreed to by the Minister of Education Peter Weir. It had originally been proposed that the school would close at the end of August . However, the closure date has been extended to August . Mr Weir said: Having weighed up all the information, including the fact that  of the  pupils will be exiting P, with no new intake for - or September , it is clear that unfortunately the school is not sustainable, and that provision for any pupils in an integrated setting can be made where in the city. googletag.cmd.push The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained integrated status in . A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and Mr Weir at the beginning of this year. However, the decision was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. Following that decision, numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. googletag.cmd.push The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the Waterside. The school caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack said young people have been holding parties and lighting fires at the former Foyle College site at Northland Road. Cllr Cusack said: This is a large site which unfortunately is very easily accessed. It is due to be the site for the new Ardnashee school with an estimated date of Spring  for the works to commence. We all know what happened with the old building when it had to be demolished last year following an arson attack and it seems the site has again become a magnet for anti social behaviour. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Cusack said that in recent weekslocal residents have reported large numbers of youths trying to access the site with drink. They have set up palettes for seating within the trees at the periphery of the site and can be heard partying into the early hours causing sleepless nights for the residents. The PSNI and the Council Community Safety Wardens have been in attendance and have witnessed evidence of drug taking also. This latest incident, which we all feared shows how these gatherings can escalate and get out of control engendering both themselves, others and surrounding property. I have been speaking with the authorities and directly with the Education Authority at the end of last week who had committed to removing materials and investigate private security to monitor the private site. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, I would ask parents and the public to play their part and either talk to your child about this area or report any trespass you see. While the obvious activities of underage drinking, drugs and now arson are very worrying we cannot forget the silent killer of Covid being transmitted when unmonitored crowds gather.

In the cargo hold, mess halls and exercise areas were also added.Entering service near the end of the war, the Georgetown Victory and  other Victory troopships were given the task of transporting the troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The vessel was operated by the American Export Lines.The ship departed Sydney with , troops steaming to Glasgow, stopping for water and fuel at Fremantle in Australia, Colombo in Sri Lanka and Aden in Yemen via the Suez Canal.On April , , just before midnight, the ship ran aground hard, at near top speed,  yards south of Killard Point.All of the servicemen aboard were rescued by leboats and breeches buoy to a tug started at about am.William said local people can remember some men wading ashore through heavy fuel oil from the stricken vessel to be cared for in nearby homes.

They bind communities together, mitigate against isolation and provide something close to an essential service. It is unthinkable that they would be allowed to collapse.Mr OrsquoToole, who is a former Downing Street press officer, says he also favours a tax on the internet giants.ldquoA number of months ago, I wrote to the Executive to ask them to initiate work on my action plan, which includes a rates holiday for local newspapers, prioritising local media in advertising spend, committing to a poundm journalism fund and to press the British Government to institute a digital information levy on social media giants such as Facebook and Google, he said.The MLA added: ldquoI welcomed the opportunity to engage with the finance minister where I pressed upon him the importance of committing to act to save this vital industry.

We had the most beautul Art Deco Vaudeville theatre for celebrities, actors and directors to view their work. So I always loved it and knew I wanted to create something like that when it came todesigning the cinema, explained Jacqueline.Jacqueline reeled in her professional interior design skills, repurposing household items and getting inspiration from the dance showrsquos judgesrsquo table for her home cinema.She said: ldquoTony and I moved back home from London and built our home where we had a basement constructed. But it became a storage area and the kids were sitting more or less in the middle of it.ldquoWe drove up to Belfast and got wadding to line the walls. When we ran out of wadding, we just used old duvets. We covered the wadding with red velvet. That made the room soundproof.ldquoWe are cocooned watching a movie and a massive thunder storm would pass without us even hearing it. Tony did the building work by and the kids helped. We called them the film crew.ldquoI also got gold paint and mixed that with glitter to give the old-style feel of the movie room. We made a bar thatrsquos inspired by the judgesrsquo  table on Strictly Come Dancing. I was watching the show one night and thought Irsquod like to make something like that.The Art Deco-style columns were Billy bookcases from Ikea that we painted. I had a mirror bought for me that needed a place to hang it and we put that in the bar where it really suits. A relative bought us a popcorn machine for added authenticity.She said that from creating the mood board for the project to when it was completed took four weeks, but it really was not used until lockdown.ldquoBefore the Covid- restrictions, the cinema was something we had started and used a bit. When lockdown came and the cinemas closed, the kids were never out of our cinema, she said.ldquoThe kids can go in there and watch their Netflix and Disney Plus mdash we have Sky, Netflix and every other movie and plus channel going now during lockdown so we can get the newly released movies as they are streamed.ldquoNow therersquos so much satisfaction with it. Itrsquos something special we designed and built as a family and now use as a family. Itrsquos a special place because we all have invested our time, love and effort into it.However, there are no plans to rule out trips to the cinema after they are allowed to reopen.Jacqueline added: ldquoWe will continue to support our local cinema. Our home cinema is great but therersquos nothing like the real thingThe movie theatre, whether it be modern or old-style, is a magical place and I hope we all continue going to the movies and supporting our cinemas for many years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former council chairman  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former SDLP councillor Patsy Toman who sadly passed away last week.

He was a principled man who helped everyone, regardless of their politics and always stood up for what he believed to be right.A passionate defender of the Ballynahinch electoral area, he lobbied hard to secure investment and was a key player in the drive to secure a new bypass around the market town.Mr Toman made a signicant contribution to the district and a number of organisations, including Loughinisland GAC. He was the clubrsquos former cultural officer and treasurer.Leading the tributes to her friend and former council colleague, Lady Ritchie said the community of Loughinisland and further afield had lost a man of ldquoimmeasurable integrity and the epitome of hard work and resilience.

I can recall Patsy working in that shop and sometimes he delivered our groceries, she recalled.ldquoIn our many conversations, he recalled those visits and how I was only ever interested in the lemonade bottles that were in the grocery box. At that early stage of his le, Patsy was in a hurry and, above all, he was super efficient to get the job done. His attention to detail was legendary.Lady Ritchie said that she next met Mr Toman at a meeting of the SDLPrsquos Down District Executive in Dundrum in June .ldquoPatsy obviously knew who I was because he asked meI was still in Belfast.

He was a member of Ballynahinch Credit Union, Magherlegan Pipe Band, the Monday Club in Drumaness and Loughinisland GAC, as well as numerous organisations associated with the former Down Council.

He always stood solidly with the families in their fight for justice and truth, she continued.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman was involved in the politics of the SDLP for a long time and was a founder member and chairman of the partyrsquos Drumaness branch.He was elected to Down Council in  and subsequently re-elected in , , ,  and  and while he retired from elected politics in , he remained active in the community.ldquoPatsy was a stalwart on the East Border Region Committee and the Ards Down Rural Partnership, continued Lady Ritchie.ldquoI fought many elections with him and he kept driving everyone to go the extra mile to achieve better representation. AndPatsy had an issue that required a resolution, he pursued you until he got an answer, applying that same approach for all of his constituents.Lady Ritchie said Mr Toman had been a ldquotrue, loyal friend for many years and was delighted and honoured to attend his th birthday celebrations in April of last year.ldquoPatsy always confronted you with his political problems which were not major at all. Such was the loyalty and bond between Patsy and myself that whenever I was ill with breast cancer, both he and his we Anne arranged a special Mass for me the day before my surgery. I will never forget that and I am eternally grateful to Patsy and Anne for their personal support to me during my political and personal le, she added.She added: ldquoPatsy was an extremely loyal inidual a family man who cherished his we, children and grandchildren.

Their story, along with other couples’,s told in a new online book, Exiles for Love, by charity, the Northern Ireland Mixed Marriage Association .Anne said: “We met at a dance ... a typical boy meets girl kind of thing – not a Prod meets Taig.

It was really horrible time.”Jimmy said: “Mixed marriage was never our problem, but other people made it theirs and we felt that we had to get away from Northern Ireland.”He added: “We’re very happy to do whatever it takes to help others and hope our story does just that. “We’ve had a good le, have no regrets and both know that when the going got tough, we became stronger as a couple.”The Northern Ireland Mixed Marriage Associationhas been providing information and support to couples since  and its chairman Ken Dunn said the charity is delighted to maintain its services despite the effects of the pandemic.“We are here at the end of an e-mail or a telephone as we have always been, to listen, guide and support and our new book Exiles for Love, in which mixed couples tell their stories of leaving the Province, reinforces our message of tolerance and compromise”. The new book, which like its two predecessors is about couples and the children of mixed marriages, has been distributed to integrated schools and shared campuses by the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. It gives five couples the chance to tell why they left home after marrying ‘across the ide’ and is the third part of a trilogy that has put a previously taboo subject under the spotlight. Mr Dunn added: “The project will, hopefully, reinforce the message of reconciliation that our first two books, Mixed Emotions and Both Sides Now are already bringing to local secondary school pupils and also highlight the position of the substantial mixed marriage community in the Province.“We are responding to the constant demand for information about both the logistics of mixed marriage and the actual experience itself.... but the stories of those, who either chose or were forced to leave Northern Ireland as a result of their marriages, are the final parts of an emotional jigsaw.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Who doesn’t Admittedly, over the years there have been a few Fawlty Towers’ experiences, with grisly memories of thunderous plumbing, stained s carpets and food that wouldn’t look out of place in a Bushtucker Trial, but in the main, the majority of my hotel visits have been wonderful.And that is because, evenit is just for one night, a hotel stay is a temporary escape from normality a cocoon where le’s realities and worries are momentarily left behind.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Helen at a hand santising stationThe bliss begins the moment you open the hotel bedroom door and survey the surrounds. The luxury of an expertly made bed with perfectly-pressed sheets and a swaddling duvet. The thrill of an ensuite bathroom with fluffy white towels, dinky shampoo bottles and a shower head the size of a dinner plate. Ordering food to the room and not having to do the dishes. Not having to do anything, in fact. But in a post-lockdown world, what would staying in a hotel be like  Would it be joyless and clinical  Not worth the bother of packing one’s toothbrush To find out, my daughter Maria and I booked into Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Londonderry, a luxurious, boutique establishment within the historic city walls. Having spent the last few months together with the hell-on-earth of home-schooling and not going further than the local park for a walk, we were practically exploding with excitement as we arrived at the exquisite Grade B listed building. Before going through the revolving doors we squirted on hand-sanitiser from a large dispenser, then followed the arrows on the floor to reception, where an exceptionally friendly receptionist welcomed us from behind Perspex.Ourroom key was presented in an envelope, as was a map to the city. None of this seemed weird or impersonal, in fact it was a comfort to know these measures were in place. We were asked to book in for breakfast the following morning, rather than just turning up. Again, absolutely fine.Before taking the lt to our room, we hand-sanitised once more from a wall-mounted dispenser.A quick scan around our beautul room, decorated in muted tones with pops of orange, and it was hard to tell that anything was dferent than from before lockdown. On closer, Columbo-style inspection, I noticed the TV remote encased in a plastic covering there were no tourist leaflets, pens or stationery, menus or information booklets about the hotel - the paraphernalia you wouldnormally find in a hotel room. There was, however, a Bible in a drawer and the usual tea and coffee making facilities. In the bathroom a bottle of hand sanitiser was provided along with all the other toiletries. Before dinner in the Gown restaurant, we enjoyed a pre-dinner drink in the Wig Champagne Bar.A one-way system was in operation, with patrons going in one door and out the other. Tables were spaced apart and there was a convivial atmosphere as patrons sipped extravagant-looking cocktails. The staff were not wearing masks, but kept their distance.Drinks were ordered and served at our table, so no propping up the bar. I noticed staff thoroughly clean a table and seats with sanitiser after some customers had left.None of this spritzing, cleaning and hand-sanitising, dampened our elation: not only were we staying in a hotel, we were going to have wonderful dinner cooked by someone  served to us at our table. After months cooped up together in our home, with humble, uneventful meals, it felt joyous.The safety measures, such as the one-way route, were more reassuring than annoying and the frequent hand-sanitising became second nature. In the dining room, hygiene measures were unobtrusive, tables spaced apart, a waitress spritzing chairs and tables. We settled down, thrilled to be dining out, My daughter delighted to have a choice beyond beans on toast and beans under toast.Her squid starter was a symphony of flavours, my goat’s cheesetart, scrumptious. Our mains, cod for her, hake for me, were substantial andsublime.We rounded off with sticky toffee pudding and a visually dazzling Baked Alaska, me happy at the thought of not having to clear the table and stack the dishwasher .Next day we were planning a stomp around the city walls, so set ourselves up with good breakfasts - an omelette for me, and a pancake stack for Maria. Buffet items, such as croissants, pastries and fruit salads were inidually wrapped on a table, alongside little boxes of cereals. Other than that, the breakfast experience was normal.I noticed diners who hadn’t booked in for lunch, being asked for their names and telephone numbers - a way, I assume, for the hotel to track any customer should any guest later report Covid-. The new safety measures at Bishop’s Gate Hotel do not, in my opinion, impinge on the visitor experience, but obviously a lot of hard work has gone on, and is going on, behind the scenes to ensure customer and staff safety. Ciaran O’Neill, managing director of the hotel, said when the Executive confirmed July  as the date for the reopening of hotels in Northern Ireland, they implemented ious new measures to facilitate a safe reopening.These included the installation of hand sanitiser stations at entry points, the introduction of disinfectant “fogging” machines to sanitise guest bedrooms, a contactless payment policy where possible and reconfiguration of bar and restaurant areas.‘‘It really is like trading in a new world,’’ he said. ‘‘We have embraced the challenges and we have worked to ensure that we have a safe environment for our employees and guests, while still maintaining the Bishop’s Gate magic that we are renowned for.“Feedback from customers to date suggests that the “new” hotel experience looks very like what it was before, albeit with some face masks apparent, increased evidence of cleaning and some changes to the flow of guests through the building.“As the relationship between each brand and consumer starts by building trust, regaining customer confidence will be the first step in overcoming the crisis. Le willto normal. Our industry will bounce back.’’My first foray back into hotels after lockdown was a resounding success.I felt as well-tended to as I would pre-Covid-.Being constantly assured of my safety by the meticulous, friendly staff was a comfort. I only wish I could have stayed longer in this particular bubble. *Bishop’s Gate Hotel, www.bishopsgatehotelderry+  \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a

money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government

expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
