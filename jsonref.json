Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in cross the line at the border village of Panmunjom in Demilitarized Zone Friday (Picture: AP)With a single step over a weathered, cracked slab of concrete, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made history by crossing over the world’s most heavily armed border to greet his rival, South Korean president Moon Jae-in.Mr Kim then invited Moon to cross briefly north with him before they returned to the southern side for talks on North Korea’s nuclear weapons.This panda is just what we want to be like this weekendThose small steps must be seen in the context of the last year – when the United States, its ally South Korea and the North seemed at times to be on the verge of nuclear war as the North unleashed a torrent of weapons tests.The moment must also be viewed in light of the long, destructive history of the rival Koreas, who fought one of the 20th century’s bloodiest conflicts and even today occupy a ided peninsula that is still technically in a state of war.‘I feel like I’m firing a flare at the starting line in the moment of (the two Koreas) writing a new history in North-South relations, peace and prosperity,’ Mr Kim told Mr Moon as they sat at a table, its precise dimension of 2018 millimetres separating them, to begin their closed-door talks.North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests last year likely put it on the threshold of becoming a legitimate nuclear power (Picture: EPA)Mr Moon responded that there were high expectations that they produce an agreement that will be a ‘big gift to the entire Korean nation and every peace loving person in the world’.It was all smiles on Friday as Mr Moon grasped Mr Kim’s hand and led him along an blindingly red carpet into South Korean territory, where school children placed flowers around their necks and an honour guard stood at attention for inspection.Beyond the surface, however, it is still not clear whether the leaders can make any progress in closed-door talks on the nuclear issue, which has bedevilled US and South Korean officials for decades.North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests last year likely put it on the threshold of becoming a legitimate nuclear power. North Korea claims it has already risen to that level.Mr Kim’s news agency said that the leader would ‘open-heartedly’ discuss with Mr Moon ‘all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula’ in a ‘historic’ summit.Mr Kim’s news agency said that the leader would ‘open-heartedly’ discuss with Mr Moon ‘all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula’ (Picture: AP)It is the first time one of the ruling Kim leaders has crossed over to the southern side of the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) since the Korean War ended in 1953.The greeting of the two leaders was planned to the last detail.Mr Moon stood near the Koreas’ iding line, moving forward the moment he glimpsed Mr Kim appearing in front of a building on the northern side.They shook hands with the border line between them.Mr Moon then invited Mr Kim to cross into the South Mr Kim invited Mr Moon into the North, and they then took a ceremonial photo facing the North and then another photo facing the South.Mr Moon stood near the Koreas’ iding line, moving forward the moment he glimpsed Mr Kim appearing in front of a building on the northern side (Picture: AP)Two fifth-grade students from the Daesongdong Elementary School, the only South Korean school within the DMZ, greeted the leaders and gave them flowers.Mr Kim and Mr Moon then saluted an honour guard and military band, and Mr Moon introduced Mr Kim to South Korean government officials.They posed for a photo inside the Peace House, where the summit was to take place, in front of a painting of South Korea’s Bukhan Mountain, which towers over the South Korean Blue House presidential mansion.Nuclear weapons will top the agenda, and Friday’s summit will be the clearest sign yet of whether it is possible to peacefully negotiate those weapons away from a country that has spent decades doggedly building its bombs despite crippling sanctions and near-constant international opprobrium.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (L) signs the guest book in the Peace House for the Inter-Korean Summit (Picture: Getty)Expectations are generally low, given that past so-called breakthroughs on North Korea’s weapons have collapsed amid acrimonious charges of cheating and bad faith.Sceptics of engagement have long said that the North often turns to interminable rounds of diplomacy meant to ease the pain of sanctions – giving it time to perfect its weapons and win aid for unfulfilled nuclear promises.Mr Moon, a liberal whose election last year ended a decade of conservative rule in Seoul, will be looking to make some headway on the North’s nuclear programme in advance of a planned summit in several weeks between Mr Kim and US president Donald Trump.Mr Kim, the third member of his family to rule his nation with absolute power, is eager, both in this meeting and in the Trump talks, to talk about the nearly 30,000 heavily armed US troops stationed in South Korea and the lack of a formal peace treaty ending the Korea War – two factors, the North says, that make nuclear weapons necessary.The two leaders inspect an honor guard after Kim crossed the border into South Korea for their historic face-to-face talks (Picture: AP)North Korea may also be looking to use whatever happens in the talks with Mr Moon to set up the Trump summit, which it may see as a way to legitimise its declared status as a nuclear power.One possible outcome on Friday, aside from a rise in general goodwill between the countries, could be a proposal for a North Korean freeze of its weapons ahead of later denuclearisation.Teenager screams \u0027I\u0027m Jesus\u0027 when he is arrested for leading cops on 106mph chaseSeoul and Washington will be pushing for any freeze to be accompanied by rigorous and unfettered outside inspections of the North’s nuclear facilities, since past deals have crumbled because of North Korea’s unwillingness to open up to snooping foreigners.South Korea, in announcing Thursday some details of the leaders’ meeting, acknowledged that the most difficult sticking point between the Koreas has been North Korea’s level of denuclearisation commitment.Mr Kim has reportedly said that he would not need nuclear weapons if his government’s security could be guaranteed and external threats were removed.Whatever the Koreas announce on Friday, the spectacle of Mr Kim being feted on South Korean soil will be something to behold."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9342836.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"like car drink driver","story":"A drunk teacher’s terrible driving that end with

Albert has been a frontrunner with bookies ever since Kate and William announced they were expecting their third child, as King George VI’s first name was Albert, as well as Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert, who was William’s great, great, great, great grandfather.So if the new royal kiddo is named Prince Albert, there’s a family connection.We have concerns that Kate and William might not know the other connections of the name Prince Albert, though.Friends, royals, the general public, a Prince Albert is a type of piercing. A penis piercing.Warning before you scroll: Below are some illustrations of penis piercings. A Prince Albert is a piercing of the penis, in which a metal ring is pierced through the skin at the tip of the penis.The ring begins almost straight to pierce through the penis, and is then bent with pliers to create a rounded ring shape.(Picture: )The piercing enters at the frenulum and exits at the urethra, going through the urethral meatus. Some people like to attach fun little accoutrements to their Prince Albert ring, such as a Dragonfly – six plastic barbells arranged like the rings of a dragonfly.Yes, it’s painful to have done, and should only be carried out by a professional with a lot of experience in genital piercing.It typically takes weeks to heal and there’s quite a bit of bleeding.Oh, and you do pee out of both holes, so that’s something to get used to.Variations on the Prince Albert include the Reverse Prince Albert, which goes around the top of the penis tip rather than underneath, and the Prince’s Wand, which involves a T-shaped piercing.The theory goes that Prince Albert, as in the husband of Queen Victoria herself, had a penis piercing in his twenties. This hasn’t been confirmed, sadly, but the rumours were strong enough to get the piercing named after him.Some people believe that the piercing helped the prince’s penis hang in an aesthetically pleasing fashion in tight trousers, which were the style of the day, while others suggest that he had Peyronie’s disease, and had the piercing in an attempt to straighten his penis.If Prince Albert did have such a piercing, it seems he wasn’t the first.The Kama Sutra, written far earlier than Prince Albert was around, mentions genital piercing as a way to obtain true sexual pleasure.It really depends on the type of material you use, as well as how your body and your partner’s body responds to the sensation.Generally a Prince Albert piercing will increase sensitivity in the penis, and add a new texture when stimulating the vagina.Additional beads and ridges, such as the Dragonfly addition we mentioned before, can increase sexual pleasure.The main risk you face with any kind of genital piercing is infection – it’s absolutely crucial to keep the piercing clean.There’s also the risk of the piercing causing irritation or injury during sex. Hard rings can bruise, tear, or get caught inside the anus or vagina. It’s a good idea to use additional lubrication.Aggressive sex or masturbation with a Prince Albert piercing could cause injury to the penis too, if it gets caught or yanked too quickly.Stay safe out there, dick ring fans.MORE: ‘Transhumanist’ has gone through hundreds of body modifications to evolve with technology and timeMORE: ‘With a foreskin, I know what I’m doing’: 20 women tell us what makes a good penis and whyMORE: Straight men share what sex feels like when you have a penis"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/05/4B90396D00000578-0-image-a-109_1524718220908.jpg","title":"Chance Rapper defends Kanye West Twitter","story":"    Kanye West fans and supporters have been left ided after he traded adoring tweets with President Donald Trump, but Chance the Rapper has come to his defense          \u0027Black people don\u0027t have to be democrats,\u0027 Chance, who has been one of Trump\u0027s many critics, tweeted earlier on Wednesday.

But if I would\u0027ve voted, I would\u0027ve voted for Trump,\u0027 he said.\u0027We live in a racist country. That is a fact. This world is racist, OK? Let\u0027s stop being distracted to focus on that as much.\u0027  But in a separate tweet on Wednesday, Kanye wrote that he also loved Clinton, who Kardashian publicly supported in the 2016 presidential election.\u0027If your friend jumps off the bridge you don\u0027t have to do the same,\u0027 he began. \u0027Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you.\u0027 Kris Jenner slams claims she is fighting with Kanye West...Kanye West bonds with daughter North in sweet post amid...Kanye West hit by claims he \u0027battled an opioid addiction\u0027......Share this article\u0027For people in my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don\u0027t tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary I love Hillary too.\u0027 The rapper continued to discuss free thought, saying he loves when \u0027people have their own ideas\u0027. \u0027You don\u0027t have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love. That\u0027s free thought,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027I\u0027m not even political. I\u0027m not a democrat or a republican.\u0027           West (pictured outside an LA music studio on Tuesday) recently came under fire for tweets supporting far right-wing media personality Candace Owens           Around 9.30am PST West was discussing free thought, saying he loves when \u0027people have their own ideas\u0027          The rapper declared that he was \u0027not scared anymore\u0027 and \u0027not scared of the media\u0027 eitherWest declared that he was \u0027not scared anymore\u0027 and \u0027not scared of the media\u0027.  \u0027I\u0027m not scared of the past and I\u0027m optimistic about the future,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027This tweet is in love not fear.\u0027 \u0027With love I am invincible,\u0027 he continued in a separate tweet.    \u0027Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.\u0027 ‏\u0027No race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love,\u0027 another tweet read.           West also began tweeting about love, saying it made him \u0027invincible\u0027 and that \u0027no race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love\u0027 West\u0027s Wednesday afternoon tweets began with a proclamation that \u0027traditional thinkers\u0027 were locked in a \u0027mental prison\u0027. \u0027Free thinkers don\u0027t fear retaliation for your thoughts,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison.\u0027  \u0027You are free.

She made the Dutch team as a sprinter and her coach, Jan Blankers, who would later become her husband, encouraged her to enter the Berlin 1936 Olympic trials.At 18, Fanny was selected to compete in the high jump and 4x100m relay at the Games but came in fifth place for both events. Here, she met her idol Jesse Owens and got his autograph, which became her most treasured possession.In 1938, Fanny earned her first world record and won international medals resulting in many expecting her to excel in the upcoming Helsinki Olympic Games in 1940. However, with the outbreak of World War II, the competition was cancelled a week before the Netherlands was invaded.Fanny Blankers-Koen  children and husbandBefore WWII, Fanny had become engaged to her coach Jan and on August 29, 1940, the couple were married.At the time, Jan coached the Dutch women’s athletics team and a sports journalist, even though he originally believed that women should not compete in sport. This changed after his feelings towards Fanny changed.After Fanny gave birth to her first child, Jan Junior, in 1941, it was assumed that her career was over, as at the time, it was unusual for female athletes to be married and even more so, to be mothers. As the war went on, she earned six more world records between 1942 and 1944 in athletics.          After Fanny gave birth to Jan Junior in 1941, it was assumed that her sporting career was overNotably in 1943, Fanny improved on her high jump record by 5cm to 1.71m at a special competition in Amsterdam and she tied the 100m world record but this was not formally recognised as she was competing against men when setting the record.The war meant that food was scarce and the winter of 1944-1945, also known as the Hongerwinter, Fanny and other athletes were forced to take a break from competing. However, at the 1946 European Championship, Fanny made a comeback weeks after giving birth to Fanny Junior.Although she received a lot of backlash for competing and not staying home with her children, she continued. She told the New York Times in 1982 that she ‘got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with - how do you say it? - short trousers’.British team manager Jack Crump also said that she was ‘too old to make the grade’, unaware that she was actually three months pregnant at the time. At the 1948 Olympics, Fanny won four of nine women’s events: 100m, 80m hurdles, 200m and 4x100m relay and became the first to win four golds in a single Olympics.She became known as the ‘Flying Housewife’, the ‘Flying Dutchmam’ and ‘Amazing Fanny’ by the press and was praised on her return to Amsterdam. Reporters described her style as ‘like she was chasing kids out of the pantry’ and ‘racing to the kitchen to rescue a batch of burning biscuits’.She was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange Nassau.          On her return to Amsterdam, Fanny was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange NassauFanny Blankers-Koen controversyHowever, after a period of fame and travelling abroad to promote women in sport, a new talent Foekje Dillema emerged and was dubbed the ‘new Fanny’ after she broke the record for 200m.However, tests on cells obtained from her clothing found that Dillema had a Y-chromosome in her DNA and she was possibly a 46XX46XY woman.This deformation is also known as ovotesticular DSD or true hermaphroditism and many believed that this new development was an attempt by Jan and Fanny to eliminate the competition, but these are just rumours.          Foekje Dillema, dubbed the \u0027new Fanny\u0027 seen here shaking hands with Fanny Blankers-KoenFanny Blankers-Koen cause of deathFanny competed in two more Olympic Games and her last ever winning event was the shot put in August 1955, her 58th Dutch title. She also won the 200m by 0.7 second - the highest margin in Olympic 200m history and a record that still stands today.She went on to serve as the Dutch athletics team team leader and after Jan died in 1977, she moved back to her hometown.In 1981, the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games were established and still held annually to this day. She was also commended at a gala in Monaco, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and was declared the ‘Female Athlete of the Century’.Prior to her death, she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and lived in a psychiatric nursing home. Fanny died at age 85 in Hoofddorp on January 25, 2004.What is a Google Doodle?In the Google Doodle for April 26, 2018, Fanny Blankers-Koen is honoured on what would have been her 100th birthday and is depicted running ahead of the rest on a track.

But then no other senior royals have yet visited the latest addition to the family.The Queen, who is at Windsor, was informed by phone about the birth. She may see her sixth great-grandchild at the weekend, when it is possible that William and Kate will take him to the castle to see her and Prince Philip, who is recovering from a hip replacement and unable to travel.Early visitors to Kensington Palace included Kate\u0027s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, and siblings, Pippa and James, while Princess Eugenie has also dropped in. Mrs Middleton has been seen helping out with George\u0027s school run and generally making herself useful.

Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

In the preceding two hours, received wisdom had gone from 0 to 60. The hanging judges of the lobbies put it about that we were \u0027in resignation territory\u0027.Miss Rudd certainly looked a bit drawn, if not quartered. One of the likeable things about her is that she is not much good at the poker face. You can tell when she is knackered or worried or upset.The Urgent Question was asked by her shadow, Diane Abbott. A good opponent to have. Miss Abbott opened with \u0027another day, another revelation\u0027. She then over-stated her case by comparing Miss Rudd to Lord Carrington, the foreign secretary who quit after the Falkland Islands were invaded.By the time she reached her peroration, calling on Miss Rudd to do the honourable thing and resign, she thus had to shout over Tory mockery. The resignation demand would have been more effective had she been able to say it with cold sorrow.Amber Rudd SCRAPS targets for the deportation of illegal...Oh, Jeremy you do tell wonderful porkies...QUENTIN LETTS on...Share this articleSeveral ministers were present to show support for Miss Rudd. Among them: the Foreign Office\u0027s Sir Alan Duncan, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, the Attorney General, the International Aid Secretary, and Defra\u0027s Michael Gove. On the Tory backbenches were members of the Rudd party.Sir Nicholas Soames (Con, Mid Sussex) said twice that Miss Rudd had \u0027the total support of this side of the House\u0027 (indignant hear-hears) and \u0027was trying to resolve a very difficult, very difficult legacy issue\u0027. Did he mean it was her legacy from the last home secretary? From the Tory Right, Philip Davies (Con, Shipley) urged Miss Rudd to keep deporting illegal immigrants. Apart from \u0027the metropolitan Labour elite\u0027, most people wanted illegals to be removed, said Mr Davies. It just showed \u0027how out of touch they are with working-class communities\u0027 if they used the Windrush saga to block fair deportations. Miss Rudd was probably never happier to listen to ardent Brexiteer Mr Davies.    Ms Rudd said she had become aware of the scandal \u0027months earlier\u0027 but had failed to grasp the gravity of the situation          Amber Rudd appearing in front of the Home Affairs select committee to give evidence David Lammy (Lab, Tottenham), who has had a good Windrush campaign, claimed the Home Office had ignored \u0027impact statements\u0027 on immigration rules.Ah, impact statements. Like targets and equality assessments and cost-benefit analyses and other official gauges, such things are Whitehall tank-traps. They exist chiefly as brakes on executive initiative and despatch.Mr Lammy, like other Opposition MPs, wanted Miss Rudd to quit. The more those calls were made, the more the Tories rallied round her, the more they accused Labour of going soft on deporting illegals – and the more confident she looked.By elevenses she was looking more secure than she had done two hours earlier. The squall seemed to have passed.The only other item of note: in Defra questions, Mr Gove was asked about his illiberal, politically opportunistic proposal to ban electric pet-containment fences.The matter was put with florid grandeur by John Hayes (Con, S Holland \u0026amp The Deepings), who cited TS Eliot on cats and argued that such fences actually prevent animal suffering because they stop pets being run over on the road. Mr Gove confessed he had received a vast postbag from pet lovers and hinted that a part-climbdown may be in the works. One should hope so. It was a wicked idea."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/23/4B786E9B00000578-5662591-image-a-6_1524782465440.jpg","title":"Check French President Emmanuel Macrons hunky security detail","story":"    French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte are escorted back to their car by  their security detail including one particularly stylish agent (second right)  after visiting the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC on Monday          The security detail (right) looks like a mix of Timothy Olyphant and Ricky Martin          The security agent (left) threatens to steal the show from President Macron and his first lady as  wellwishers photograph them on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial          With his skinny tie and perfectly styled hair he complements the elegant French first coupleAnother guard was captured on camera leading the couple wearing a navy suit with a polka dot tie and black shades. Emmanuel and Brigitte joined President Trump and Melania for their glitzy banquet on Tuesday night.The four exchanged kisses and posed for pictures before heading to the dinner party.Other notable guests included Rupert Murdoch and wife Jerry Hall, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Apple CEO Tim Cook, DOD head James Mattis and Speaker Paul Ryan.

Its actions have included organising a sit-in at Waitrose over its stocking of Israeli products.Earlier this year, Israel banned activists from War on Want – nicknamed \u0027War on Israel\u0027 by its critics – from entering the country over its support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) campaign, which encourages consumers not to buy Israeli goods and to put pressure on firms to pull money out of the country.Mr Dearn has tweeted about the boycott, which was branded as \u0027bigotry\u0027 by Labour\u0027s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry last year.

Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

In the preceding two hours, received wisdom had gone from 0 to 60. The hanging judges of the lobbies put it about that we were \u0027in resignation territory\u0027.Miss Rudd certainly looked a bit drawn, if not quartered. One of the likeable things about her is that she is not much good at the poker face. You can tell when she is knackered or worried or upset.The Urgent Question was asked by her shadow, Diane Abbott. A good opponent to have. Miss Abbott opened with \u0027another day, another revelation\u0027. She then over-stated her case by comparing Miss Rudd to Lord Carrington, the foreign secretary who quit after the Falkland Islands were invaded.By the time she reached her peroration, calling on Miss Rudd to do the honourable thing and resign, she thus had to shout over Tory mockery. The resignation demand would have been more effective had she been able to say it with cold sorrow.Amber Rudd SCRAPS targets for the deportation of illegal...Oh, Jeremy you do tell wonderful porkies...QUENTIN LETTS on...Share this articleSeveral ministers were present to show support for Miss Rudd. Among them: the Foreign Office\u0027s Sir Alan Duncan, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid, the Attorney General, the International Aid Secretary, and Defra\u0027s Michael Gove. On the Tory backbenches were members of the Rudd party.Sir Nicholas Soames (Con, Mid Sussex) said twice that Miss Rudd had \u0027the total support of this side of the House\u0027 (indignant hear-hears) and \u0027was trying to resolve a very difficult, very difficult legacy issue\u0027. Did he mean it was her legacy from the last home secretary? From the Tory Right, Philip Davies (Con, Shipley) urged Miss Rudd to keep deporting illegal immigrants. Apart from \u0027the metropolitan Labour elite\u0027, most people wanted illegals to be removed, said Mr Davies. It just showed \u0027how out of touch they are with working-class communities\u0027 if they used the Windrush saga to block fair deportations. Miss Rudd was probably never happier to listen to ardent Brexiteer Mr Davies.    Ms Rudd said she had become aware of the scandal \u0027months earlier\u0027 but had failed to grasp the gravity of the situation          Amber Rudd appearing in front of the Home Affairs select committee to give evidence David Lammy (Lab, Tottenham), who has had a good Windrush campaign, claimed the Home Office had ignored \u0027impact statements\u0027 on immigration rules.Ah, impact statements. Like targets and equality assessments and cost-benefit analyses and other official gauges, such things are Whitehall tank-traps. They exist chiefly as brakes on executive initiative and despatch.Mr Lammy, like other Opposition MPs, wanted Miss Rudd to quit. The more those calls were made, the more the Tories rallied round her, the more they accused Labour of going soft on deporting illegals – and the more confident she looked.By elevenses she was looking more secure than she had done two hours earlier. The squall seemed to have passed.The only other item of note: in Defra questions, Mr Gove was asked about his illiberal, politically opportunistic proposal to ban electric pet-containment fences.The matter was put with florid grandeur by John Hayes (Con, S Holland \u0026amp The Deepings), who cited TS Eliot on cats and argued that such fences actually prevent animal suffering because they stop pets being run over on the road. Mr Gove confessed he had received a vast postbag from pet lovers and hinted that a part-climbdown may be in the works. One should hope so.

The dictator then thanked Moon for meeting at \u0027historic place\u0027, to which he responded by saying the dictator had made a \u0027very courageous decision\u0027 to come to the South. Scroll down for video         Kim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to step into the South for 65 years as he met with President Moon Jae-in for a historic peace summit on Friday       The dictator, wearing his trademark black Mao suit, and President Moon, in a navy jacket, hold hands as they walk side-by-side across the demarcation line inside the truce village of Panmunjom at the start of Friday\u0027s summit         The two leaders shook hands while standing over the world\u0027s most heavily defended border before taking turns to cross over from north to south              Kim and Moon enjoyed the symbolism of crossing the Military Demarcation Line together, which remains the most heavily defended border in the world         Moon  seized on the South\u0027s Winter Olympics as an opportunity to broker dialogue with Kim Jong-un, and has said his meeting with the dictator will serve to set up the summit between Pyongyang and Washington         North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, right, next to his suster Kim Yo Jong) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (centre, left) had \u0027serious, frank\u0027 discussions on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and a permanent peace in their first summit session on Friday         In his opening remarks, Kim said he was \u0027flooded with emotion\u0027 after crossing the military demarcation line, adding that it was \u0027so easy\u0027 making him wonder \u0027why it took so long to do so after 11 years\u0027         The leaders talked unaccompanied on a nearby bridge after their lunch break and they are later expected to resume their summitNorth Korea¿s nuclear test site has collapsed ... and that may be why Kim Jong-un suspended tests | South China Morning Post"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/23/4B786E9B00000578-5662591-image-a-6_1524782465440.jpg","title":"Check French President Emmanuel Macrons hunky security detail","story":"    French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte are escorted back to their car by  their security detail including one particularly stylish agent (second right)  after visiting the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC on Monday          The security detail (right) looks like a mix of Timothy Olyphant and Ricky Martin          The security agent (left) threatens to steal the show from President Macron and his first lady as  wellwishers photograph them on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial          With his skinny tie and perfectly styled hair he complements the elegant French first coupleAnother guard was captured on camera leading the couple wearing a navy suit with a polka dot tie and black shades. Emmanuel and Brigitte joined President Trump and Melania for their glitzy banquet on Tuesday night.The four exchanged kisses and posed for pictures before heading to the dinner party.Other notable guests included Rupert Murdoch and wife Jerry Hall, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Apple CEO Tim Cook, DOD head James Mattis and Speaker Paul Ryan.

Deluded. Emotive nonsense. These are unusually strong terms for a judge to use, particularly in a case as intensely sad and bitterly contested as that of the terminally ill child Alfie Evans. Yet Mr Justice Hayden, referring to some of the campaigners now surrounding Alfie’s parents, did not mince his words, after this most hellish of ethical dilemmas ended this week in a court ruling that the child’s ventilator be switched off against the family’s\u0026nbspwishes.The judge was careful not to attach blame to Tom Evans and Kate James, who cannot accept the settled view of their son’s doctors that his brain has been damaged catastrophically by an as yet undiagnosed condition, or that the intensive treatment required to keep him alive is no longer in his best interest and may be causing him suffering.Alfie’s parents have fought like tigers both in and out of court and no parent – even those whose sympathies in this case are with the doctors facing death threats for doing what they honestly believe is the right thing – will begrudge the family their right to clutch in their grief at every straw there is.But the high court judge is surely right to question the motives of some of those extending straws. The most disturbing aspect of this case is the sense that it is now being exploited by those who see Alfie not as a desperately sick little boy, but as an expedient means of advancing their own ideological cause.That description doesn’t just apply to the pro-life movement, of course. Among Alfie’s viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters, which includes many parents of small children, you will find anti-vaxxers using the story to peddle utterly deluded junk science theories about the Vitamin K injection every newborn gets. You’ll find American gun lobby enthusiasts ranting on about how this is what happens when “the government” runs people’s lives and that’s why everyone needs to keep hold of their weapons never mind that this decision has nothing to do with the government, resting as it does on the independent judgment of doctors upheld by an independent judiciary.Others have sought to use the case to score cheap, wildly inaccurate points over healthcare reform in the US to claim this is where “socialised medicine” gets you, when without the NHS and its daily miracle of providing treatment free at the point of use, Alfie’s parents would now be struggling with medical bills running into the millions.And where far-right conspiracy sites such as Infowars and Breitbart rush in, an army of trolls inevitably follows. Staff at Alder Hey children’s hospital have experienced a horrific barrage of death threats and other online abuse. There have been ugly scenes at the hospital too, reports of over-zealous protesters blocking ambulances or intimidating visitors and patients. It is all too uncomfortably reminiscent of those who harass pregnant women outside abortion clinics and threaten to kill doctors offering terminations, so high on their self-righteous mission to save that all other human lives cease to matter.But none of that is quite what the judge meant. His concern centres specifically on the way the Evans family has been taken under the wing of a hitherto little-known evangelical group called the Christian Legal Centre, which has supplied the parents with a barrister and, somewhat dubiously, the services of a law student named Pavel Stroilov. A statement drafted for Alfie’s father was, according to Hayden, loaded with “vituperation and bile” against the hospital, which had not helped the baby’s case. At one point, Stroilov apparently became party to an attempt by Alfie’s father to have the doctors prosecuted for murder.The family’s former solicitor Mary Holmes has accused activists of seeking to “keep this child alive at any costs and not for the right reasons”, using the case to raise their profile with interventions such as securing Tom Evans an audience with the pope. Most seriously, Stroilov stands accused of giving Evans inaccurate advice in a letter stating that he had the legal right to remove his son from the hospital, despite a court order to the contrary, causing an understandably emotional standoff between the parents and the hospital when it became clear that was not the case. What is compassionate or Christian about giving a desperate man false hope?The judge’s objection to an outpouring of what he called “emotive nonsense” in his courtroom is not to be confused with heartlessness. Rather, it is a recognition that courts are the one place where, in cases like these, reason can still prevail over white-hot emotion that their job is to provide a calm enough environment for doctors facing impossibly difficult choices to explain their clinical reasoning, and for evidence to be considered on its merits. For in British law, what matters is what is in the best interest of the child, not of the parents or the doctors or wider public opinion, and certainly not of organised religion. The court process functions only when the adults involved can be mature enough to put their own interests to one side, which means lawyers in such cases acting as advocates for their clients – not campaigners advancing their own beliefs.And while advocacy may mean fighting to the bitter end, there are times when it means gently introducing a client to the idea that it is time to stop that however unreconciled they are to a painful verdict, it isn’t going to change. It is a conversation that would be familiar, ironically enough, not only to doctors but to priests.The church’s role can be to give hope where secular medicine has none. Light a candle, say a prayer, and just for a minute you might believe in a miracle. Yet that is not its only role at the end of life, when the dying and the grieving are looking as much for comfort as for hope and for help in accepting the inevitable with grace. As Psalm 23: 4 has it, “Yea, though I walk through the shadows of the valley of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.” This family is walking through the shadows of that valley now, and they deserve to be accompanied by people with only their best interests at heart. May they find the comfort and grace they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5691e24f2b959f551cfcba7fd0cb690651772a/0_56_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7d3e572a4f3dc2188a96e362b182eb6","title":"cult of gdp economists production indicators","story":"In this new, hi-tech era, the old production indicators fail to tell us whether the economy is working for peopleThis morning at\u0026nbsp9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will release its latest estimate of UK economic output – gross domestic product, or GDP for short. The figures, which will be revised when better data becomes available, will be endlessly discussed and analysed, and will form the basis for economic commentary and policy in the months ahead.At their best, economic indicators such as GDP can be a viewfinder through which we see the economy. After all, we need statistics to shed light on economic imbalances and unfairness, and help citizens and policymakers understand what needs to be done to put them right.\u0026nbspBut as an economist, I’m always aware that reducing the unimaginable complexity and ersity of the economy to a single number – or even a series of numbers\u0026nbsp – can dehumanise or even misrepresent what is really happening in people’s lives.Getting that full, accurate picture of the economy has always been difficult. But the pace at which disruptive technologies are changing our economy is shifting the nature of the challenge from one year to the next.\u0026nbspThere’s now a real risk that the favoured selection of go-to economic indicators doesn’t capture the impact of those new technologies on economic behaviour and trends.\u0026nbspFor instance, digitalisation – the increasing prevalence of information and communication technologies, and of the internet in work and social life – is having a rapid and profound impact on the economy. One challenge it poses for economists is that it is moving whole swaths of activity beyond what we call the “production boundary”, which is captured by GDP. We need to find new ways of measuring these if we are to obtain an accurate picture of what’s actually happening in the economy.Profit-shifting by companies to minimise their UK tax liabilities is a well-known phenomenon, and it’s likely to be increasing our current account deficit, as it means companies sending income to lower-tax countries. We need to understand the effect of this better, and find ways to measure and account for it. We also fail to properly understand how new forms of “intangible assets” – such as software, databases and knowledge acquired through research – are affecting the economy, while the way in which technology adds value to goods and services is also changing.\u0026nbspPublic policy to steer the economy will succeed in its aims only if it is informed by both accurate economic indicators to provide the macroeconomic context, and credible evidence of its impact via robust evaluation, so we need to keep investing in our public data if it is to remain relevant. But it’s not just a case of improving the statistics we currently focus on. Our reliance on a small number of production indicators narrows economic debate and perpetuates the myth that economic growth encompasses all other economic goals. Simply tracking GDP and a small number of production statistics is not enough and it may even undermine progress towards a more just economy, as it distracts attention from the issues that really matter.\u0026nbspIf we want to understand whether the economy is really delivering for its citizens, we need some new indicators. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), where I am the chief economist, is proposing a dashboard of five outcome indicators, to be updated annually, which would directly measure our progress against the outcomes the public wants the economy to deliver – broadly shared prosperity, justice and sustainability. Our chosen indicators are the distribution of the gains from growth poverty rates among children and adults levels of wellbeing among iniduals at different income levels the gap between the median income of the poorest region of the UK and the richest and the gap between projected carbon emissions and the cost-effective path to decarbonisation.\u0026nbspTogether, these indicators reveal how broadly the economy distributes its rewards, whether it is succeeding at reducing poverty, whether people feel satisfied with their lives, and our progress at moving to an environmentally sustainable model of growth. Our suggested indicators are not the only ways of measuring these goals, but between them, we believe they would capture the current performance of the economy in achieving the outcomes that matter most. If the economy doesn’t show improvement by\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmetrics we have chosen, it isn’t working.• Catherine Colebrook is chief economist at IPPR and author of Measuring What Matters: Improving the Indicators of Economic Performance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e515c0780dee3d4a664d86c43ca5ecbdd37ed281/0_1479_2965_1779/master/2965.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa81f2bd7cb89eb8ed98fdfa3eadf8b","title":"privatisation forests forestry commission commercial development","story":"The Forestry Commission is party to semi-commercial development that could be devastating for our countryside. It should know betterThere is something murky down in the forest. In 2010, the Cameron government was so shocked at the reaction to its planned privatisation of the Forestry Commission that it backed off. It said it had abandoned the whole idea. It lied. It just privatised in secret.Plans have emerged of the commission’s proposals for Mortimer Forest outside Ludlow, an exquisite stretch of woodland in the Welsh Marches. A company called Forest Holidays wants to erect an estate of 70 luxury chalets in the forest. It is, in truth, a scattered luxury hotel, serviced by car parks, toilets, recreation areas and “landscaped lookouts”. The company already has 10 such estates and plans many more, with up to 90 chalets in each. These are not rural communities or compact villages.This might all seem small beer, another example of the oleaginous workings of “parastatal” Britain. The country may have less woodland per acre than anywhere in Europe, but it can surely handle a few private estates of “hot tubs and fluffy towels”. As the company said recently, it is as yet developing only an “infinitesimal” share of the commission’s estate.The Forest Holidays deal, in effect with the government, is extraordinary. The government has granted a private company exclusive access to exploit a public land bank. There will be no competitors, no rival bidders and no limit to its growth. Indeed the company and the commission make planning applications jointly, as if they were one and the same.It is small wonder this whole saga has been shrouded in secrecy. The Mortimer Forest plan has been with Hereford council for three years, only seeing the light of day in February. Doubtless because of the privatisation row, the 2012 deal stipulated that the commission commit itself to secrecy. It would ensure “that the media and the public are not aware of new development site selection”. For a public body explicitly to promise to conceal evidence of its dereliction of duty is amazing.A spokesman for the Mortimer campaigners, Colin Richards, is a passionate defender of forest wildness. To\u0026nbsphim, the chalet development will destroy the tranquillity of what is, in this case, not even a particularly large forest. As a result of the development, he says: “Wildlife habitat on publicly owned land will be destroyed in favour of a busy private holiday park. The whole project is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”The Forestry Commission denies that it is engaged in privatisation, despite actually holding shares in the relevant private company. It argues that “the forests are still publicly owned, and the Forestry Commission retains control of what can happen on the land through the business framework agreement”. But the terms of this agreement are biased in the company’s favour, and they indicate a blatant conflict of interest. It\u0026nbspis like London Zoo going into\u0026nbsptaxidermy.I love forests. I have no objection in principle to their privatisation – a tree is a tree – provided it is subject to objective planning and impartial regulation. There is none of that here. Chalet parks in public forests offend every dictate of rural planning. They are space-hungry, traffic-generating and energy-inefficient. Today, buildings (and jobs) should be concentrated on and around existing settlements, not left to sprawl wherever the money is good. Worst of all, these parks derive their private value by diminishing the public value of where they are located.The future of the British countryside is in the balance. Traditional town and country planning is in abeyance, following David Cameron’s dismantling of structure planning. Whitehall now forces through almost any development application, irrespective of quality or setting. No village or town is safe from a Persimmon 300-unit volume executive estate. There is no requirement to respect local character, once elementary planning\u0026nbsppractice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37815adb76d18772e549176435733cb9ef6d3e01/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba0114deeceeb39506de6e0cb64d748f 465w","title":"english heritage visitor centre cliffords tower in york","story":"Exclusive: Campaigners’ legal challenge could restrict development at heritage sitesArchaeologists fear English Heritage’s plans to build a visitor centre in the mound of the 13th-century Clifford’s Tower in York will cause “substantial harm” to one of England’s most significant monuments.Legal action is being pursued in a test case that could have a major impact on the power of developers to build on heritage sites.Clifford’s Tower, a scheduled monument and all that remains of York’s royal castle, stands on a high mound raised by William the Conqueror. A structure including a concrete and glass shop, ticket office, display area and cafe, as well as an underground administration wing, is to be built into that mound.Campaigners are alarmed that  of the monument is also the developer of such an invasive scheme. They argue the extent of the excavation into untouched ground was not made plain in the planning documents.Warning that the case could set a “disastrous precedent”, they are challenging the validity of the planning consent awarded by City of York council in 2016. Through freedom of information requests, campaigners have obtained crucial documents that show the scale of the intervention, and are questioning why such documents were not submitted in the planning applications in 2016 or the judicial review last year.The Council for British Archaeology (CBA) is so concerned by the omission of such “essential information” that it argues the planning application should not have been approved.Dr Mike Heyworth, the CBA’s director, described the planning decision as “flawed” and criticised English Heritage’s apparent “lack of transparency”. “Why didn’t they draw more attention within the planning application to the fact that there was going to be this substantial excavation underneath the visitor centre?” he said. “Why wasn’t there a section drawing that showed the depth of that? It leads you to speculate as to why that was.”In a formal statement for the legal case, he said: “It is now clear from additional documents which were not submitted as part of the planning application that the proposed visitor centre will impact on the archaeological interest of the scheduled ancient monument. In particular, the proposed construction of a basement for staff accommodation and storage will lead to substantial harm to the monument.”English Heritage’s website states: “We will not be harming any archaeology by installing the visitor centre.” Heyworth said evidence of early cemeteries or human remains, for example, could exist under the mound. “Without an archaeological evaluation, which is really what’s required at this stage, it’s quite hard to see how you could press ahead on the assumption that there would be nothing disturbed,” he added.The campaign against the visitor centre is being led by Johnny Hayes, an independent York councillor, who said the majority of comments received during the public consultation process were “vehemently against” the plans. “But none of this made any difference,” he added.The case will go to the appeal court in July. A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than £17,600 towards legal costs.Campaigners this week submitted a representation to the culture secretary, asking for a revocation of the scheduled monument consent. Backed by the CBA, the representation says “the extent of excavation needed … would be very considerable” and “insufficient drawings and details of the administration wing were included in the submission and the consent to allow the impact on archaeology to be properly assessed”.It continues: “Bearing in mind that the area to be excavated would be roughly 13 metres long by 5 metres wide, this would be a very substantial penetration into important archaeological layers.”In 2015, English Heritage was ided into two bodies: Historic England, as heritage adviser, and the English Heritage trust, which conserves and presents England’s finest historic sites, with a remit to become financially self-sufficient by 2023.Hayes spoke of the irony that English Heritage would likely have opposed such a scheme in the past, yet it was now the developer, with Historic England as the inspectorate. “English Heritage has been aided and abetted by Historic England, which has done its utmost to support this application throughout,” he said. “English Heritage has entered into this new world of commerce. Now it’s about earning money.“They are theoretically separate, but it’s quite clear that they’re still fused together. This is a very dangerous precedent. They’re both poacher and gamekeeper. That’s not a healthy relationship.”Historic England said: “Clifford’s Tower is an iconic monument ... But, in spite of its importance, public access and engagement has always been seen as difficult. In assessing the proposed plans for a visitor centre, we observed that they would cause some harm to the significance of the site, and concluded that there were public benefits of understanding and access that could outweigh the harm. We therefore did not object to the proposal on heritage grounds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69256c815222bb1c3f00da105a114e136bdaff8/0_173_1828_1097/master/1828.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dae7ee293c771e865b8b36d520725450","title":"fracking south korean earthquake","story":"Researchers analysed data from November quake and found main shock occurred near fracking siteOne of South Korea’s largest earthquakes on record may have been caused by hydraulic fracturing – or fracking – according to a study published on Friday in the journal Science.A magnitude-5.5 earthquake hit the south-eastern city of Pohang on 15 November, injuring at least 70 people, temporarily displacing hundreds, and causing millions of dollars of damage. In the aftermath, residents and researchers have questioned whether the quake could be connected to a geothermal plant – the country’s first – less than 2km (about 1 mile) away.A team of researchers from the University of Glasgow, ETH-Zurich in Switzerland and GFZ-Potsdam in Germany analysed data from seismographic stations as well as satellite data to locate where the main shock and 46 aftershocks of the quake occurred. They found that the main shock occurred within 1.5km of where plant workers had been pumping thousands of cubic metres of water into the ground, creating or opening fractures in the rocks to enable water to pass between boreholes. The last of those injections was about two months before the quake.They also found that the main shock and aftershocks all occurred at depths of between 3 and 7km, which are shallow compared to previous quakes in that area, but similar to the depths at which the water was being injected.The researchers have been careful to say only that a connection is plausible. Korean authorities are also conducting their own investigation. “It would be a very a remarkable coincidence if this earthquake were to be unrelated to the activity at the site, given that it occurred so close to it,” said Robert Westaway, a senior research fellow at Glasgow university’s school of engineering, and one of the paper’s co-authors. “My own personal view is that it is highly likely there is a connection.”Westaway said further studies were being carried out to explain the two-month delay between the last round of fracking and the quake.Earthquakes caused by hydraulic fracturing have prompted concerns around the world. Two earthquakes in 2011 led to the UK imposing a fracking moratorium. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, experts have reported a millennium’s worth of quakes in two years because of fracking there.For decades, the Korean peninsula has seen almost no seismic activity. On 12 September 2016, another magnitude-5 quake struck just south of Pohang in Gyeongju. Since then the country has seen hundreds of smaller earthquakes.The study’s conclusions could also change how fracking is studied in relation to earthquakes. Previous theories have focused more on the volume of water used, rather than the pressure at which it enters the ground. In the case of the Pohang quake, a relatively small amount of water – about 10,000 cubic metres – was injected.“No one ever thought that injecting such a small amount of water could lead to such a large earthquake,” Westaway said.

Opponents warn of pollution and bioersity loss, while local officials point to its potential economic benefits. But ultimately the decision will be made thousands of miles across the AtlanticThrough the window of the small propeller plane leaving the capital Cayenne, the jungle’s canopy stretches out as far as the eye can see.Yet this corner of the Amazon forest is awaiting a decision by Emmanuel Macron’s government over the development of a controversial open-pit gold mine that would be the country’s largest. Wedged between Brazil and Suriname and about the size of Portugal, French Guiana is one of France’s lesser-known overseas departments.Its dense primary forest boasts unique bioersity and remains mysteriously wild, with most of the population concentrated along the coast.The territory has attracted shallow artisanal mining of its gold-rich soil for more than 150 years. Now, multinational companies are eyeing up deeper, untouched gold reserves. The company Montagne d’Or is a joint venture between London-based Nordgold, which is owned by Russia’s second-richest man Alexey Mordashov, and Canada’s Columbus Gold. The company is seeking an exploitation licence to dig a mine the volume of 32 football stadiums in a remote part of the forest previously exploited for its gold – a project supported by Macron.Planned over an 800-hectare site between two protected natural reserves, the mine would run along a slope less than 100 metres from the edge of one of the reserves.Environmentalists and indigenous chiefs have vehemently opposed the “mega-mine”, warning of serious risks of pollution in the basin of the Mana river which flows through indigenous land, and damage to the area’s bioersity. Opponents have particularly expressed concerns over the 57,000 tonnes of explosives, 46,500 tonnes of cyanides and 142m litres of fuel WWF estimated the company will use over the mine’s 12-year life. Montagne d’Or has contested the figures.Christophe Pierre, a 24-year-old indigenous activist from the village of Terre Rouge about 100km away from the proposed mine is unyielding.“The project is intolerable and not negotiable,” he said. “It impedes on our living space. There is hunting land nearby and pre-Colombian sites were found next to the proposed mine.“We never gave up our sovereignty on this land. The French state does not recognise our presence prior to its arrival but this has been our land for thousands for years.”A public debate over the mine has started in French Guiana, but a final decision will ultimately be taken by the French government in Paris, 4,500 miles (7,000km) away.Michel Dubouillé, general secretary of the local green party Guyane Écologie, cringed at the thought of a decision being taken “by people who share very little of our daily life here”. “Paris is completely disconnected from us,” agreed Alexis Tiouka, a member of the Kalina people from the village of Awala-Yalimapo, whose family has long spoken up about indigenous rights in French Guiana.“The forest is endangered because of legal and illegal mining. Our environment is completely polluted. We find traces of mercury in the rivers we fish in. People are ill because the whole food chain is contaminated. This shouldn’t just be about economic development,” Tiouka said. The high price of gold continues to attract illegal gold miners from Brazil who pollute rivers and underground water with mercury, which is banned in France, while bringing an explosive cocktail of drugs, prostitution and violence into the forest. France’s forest management body estimates up to 15,000 illegal miners could be working on up to 500 sites across French Guiana.Montagne d’Or has argued its institutional presence in the area would help reduce illegal mining but opponents dismissed the claims as an “illusion”, citing cases of collusion between legal and illegal miners.The company’s president, Pierre Paris, insists the project follows “responsible mining” principles which minimise environmental and social impacts and that the mine will help “the development of a robust economy in French Guiana where gold has always played a part”.“Nowhere in the world have we seen ‘clean’ mines,” said Harry Hodebourg, co-founder of Or de Question, a group of 29 local organisations and 120 international NGOs opposing the project.Denouncing the mine as “social and environmental violence”, Hodebourg criticised the company’s “aggressive” publicity campaign, including its sponsoring of the local cycling tour and this year’s carnival – a mainstay of the cultural calendar.“This project is a Trojan horse,” he added. “If we let this one pass, it will set precedent for at least five other mining projects already in the pipeline and we might not have the energy to fight all of those too.” Alongside the mine, Montagne d’Or plans a major infrastructure project. The company wants to build a new road into the forest and is considering generating its own power with fuel and renewable energy sources to meet its electricity need, estimated to be as much as all of Cayenne. Officials are also accelerating plans for the construction of a new port, necessary for the import of chemical products and equipment.Local mayor, Léon Bertrand, described the project as “an urgent short-term solution” to curtail “a major social crisis waiting to happen”. “This is not just about digging a huge hole on the bark of the planet for gold. The project would be a strong signal that French Guiana is open to investments,” he said.But the mine’s economic benefits are disputed. In a report, WWF France slammed the project as “an economic mirage” saying it would require €420m (£367m) of public finance with few positive economic impacts for French Guyana.For Mary Fleury, an ethnobotanist at the French Research Institute for Development, the project is the symbol of two clashing visions of development.She said thousands of jobs could be created by promoting the territory’s bioersity and local knowledge to boost research, teaching and innovation. “But this must be a political vision,” she said. “For the moment, the only vision officials have is to develop the territory with mining fields.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0024010ef14988f2c6c67717725e4cfe4a8a2079/32_655_1883_1130/master/1883.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba5cd74a2d6f685752fab17d524a8fd5","title":"youre the one that i want grease inspired summer fashion in pictures","story":"Celebrating its 40th anniversary, Grease is still lightning in the style stakes – as these chic Rydell High School-inspired outfits attest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7822574980b43b33fb933a153916f06aa28adffd/710_62_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c040a04e62552ae5233b4ec0a94528e","title":"what if superheroes arent really the good guys","story":"We’ve always thought of them as flawed, noble and on our side – but perhaps they’re just dangerous rightwing vigilantes• Sign up for Film Today and get our film team’s highlights of the day“We’re in the endgame now,” says Doctor Strange, mid-way through Avengers: Infinity War. He’s talking about the epic battle against the mega-villain Thanos, who is threatening to destroy half the universe. Stopping Thanos is going to require every Marvel superhero that Disney’s franchise rights can access. But Doctor Strange is also reminding us that Infinity War is the culmination of the most awesomely ambitious, successfully coordinated crossover project that cinema has ever seen, which has unfolded over a decade and nearly 20 movies.But Infinity War could represent another kind of endgame. Superhero movies are undoubtedly the success story of modern Hollywood. They have been having their cake and eating it, combining lucrative spectacle with social and political relevance. And there’s no indication that their appeal is on the wane. But as time goes on, the superhero genre has been edging ever closer to its own contradictions, and something’s got to give.In the predecessor to Infinity War, Captain America: Civil War, the US secretary of state visits the Avengers HQ and points out the elephant in the room. “What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced iniduals who routinely ignore sovereign borders, who inflict their will wherever they choose, and who frankly seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?” he asks.Like their audience, Iron Man, Captain America and co thought of themselves as flawed but noble superheroes uniting for a cause – until suddenly they were confronted with the possibility they might be dangerous, destructive, unregulated vigilantes. We’ve been seeing these awkward moments of self-awareness more and more in comic-book movies. Another one comes minutes later in the same movie. “In the eight years since Mr Stark identified himself as Iron Man, the number of enhanced persons has grown exponentially,” points out Vision, the Avengers’ cyborg super-being. “During the same period the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.” It’s a bit like the Mitchell and Webb sketch where a Nazi soldier wonders why they all have skulls on their cap badges and asks: “Are we the baddies?”It’s a question worth asking: what makes superheroes the good guys? It’s taken as a given in these movies, but there’s a nagging sense that for all their tales of heroism and sacrifice and vanquishing alien threats to Earth, the superhero moral compass is no longer pointing in the right direction.Traditionally, there was a very simple reason why superheroes were the good guys: they were on our side. “Us” being the US and its allies. DC Comics’ Superman pledged to “fight for the common man”. He took on the corruption and injustice that plagued his post-Depression society. Batman swore to avenge his parents’ death “by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals”. Wonder Woman fought with truth and love. You could argue that Superman was more socialist-leaning, Batman more rightwing and Wonder Woman impossibly idealistic – but they were all on our side. Marvel’s 1960s stable complicated the issue a little. Titles such as X-Men and Black Panther broached civil rights issues and blurred moralities. But still, Captain America socked it to Hitler and Spider-Man knew that power comes with responsibility, and kept his crimefighting to neighbourhood scale. Good guys.They were still the good guys when Sam Raimi’s 2002 Spider-Man kick-started the current comic-book movie era. The attacks of 911 were so fresh in the consciousness that the Twin Towers had to be airbrushed out of the movie’s posters, and its themes of inner courage and community spirit resonated. “You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us,” a random New Yorker yells at Spider-Man’s adversary. The first cycle of superhero movies followed a similar template, especially Iron Man, who took on Middle Eastern terrorists in his 2008 debut.In previous eras, superheroes such as Michael Keaton’s Batman or Christopher Reeve’s Superman operated in more abstract fantasy worlds, but as superheroes began to interact with vaguely here-and-now political reality, their methods came under new scrutiny. Alan Moore’s seminal 1987 comic Watchmen was one of the first to suggest that people who enjoy dressing up in costumes and beating the crap out of people might be in need of psychological evaluation, or a war crimes tribunal. Vigilantism looks a lot like authoritarianism, which looks a lot like fascism.Where does that leave a “good guy” such as Batman, who operates as both judge and jury, even applying the death penalty, with zero tolerance or oversight? Put him in the real world and you get someone like Vladimir Putin or Rodrigo Duterte.As with the Avengers, Batman was called out on this in the recent Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman, is told: “Civil liberties being trampled on in your city, good people living in fear ... he thinks he’s above the law”. The person probing him is the Daily Planet’s ace reporter Clark Kent, AKA Superman.The other change was the direction of US and western politics. That post 911 moral certainty rapidly evaporated as the “War on Terror” and the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan brought torture, extrajudicial killing, “collateral damage”, deception, mass surveillance and other abuses into the court of “the good guys”. Around the same time, superhero movies were entering their team-up phase, with the Avengers and Justice League. Questions of inidual values became more complex questions of collective values – of power and its abuses, of loyalties personal, political, even planetary.As the political soul of the Marvel cinematic universe, Captain America’s movies track the shift. In his 2011 debut The First Avenger, he’s a typical good guy: a Nazi-socking patriot with greatness thrust upon him. By the 2014 sequel, The Winter Soldier, his old-school moral certitude can’t get with the modern-day US government’s plans for universal surveillance and pre-emptive drone strikes. “This isn’t freedom it’s fear,” he assesses, and turns his back on the government (rightly so: it turns out to have been infiltrated by the neo-Nazi organisation Hydra). In the era of Edward Snowden and contentious remote warfare, this was radical stuff for a superhero movie. By part three in 2016, Civil War, Captain America refuses the secretary of state’s demand that the Avengers agree to UN oversight and splinters off with a bunch of rebel superheroes. That sets the scene for a clash of opposing superhero teams.A similar thing happens in Batman Vs Superman. And in both cases, the schism has been engineered by a hostile third party peddling false information and turning superheroes against each other. You could say these clashes reflect the polarised state of politics in the US, the UK and elsewhere, and foreign attempts to widen the isions. Or they are just brazen attempts to sustain interest in the genre by orchestrating a bogus superhero face-off. Either way, the question again needs asking, who are the good guys here?A useful way to examine the question is by turning it around and looking at some of the baddies. Let’s start with the most recent hit: Black Panther. Michael B Jordan’s antagonist Killmonger was widely regarded as one of the best things about the movie and with good reason: he’s not really bad at all. His grievances are actually perfectly valid: how could resource-rich Wakanda stand by and let all these atrocities – slavery, colonialism, world wars, racism – happen to their African brothers and sisters? Wakanda is like a Black Switzerland. It stands aloof and neutral (come to think of it, so does Wonder Woman’s home, Themiscyra). Killmonger is defeated, but he wins the argument: Black Panther realises he’s not the good guy! At the close of the movie, Wakanda begins to engage with the rest of the world, albeit on its own limited terms, which are a far cry from the armed uprising Killmonger had in mind.This seems to be the pattern with a lot of superhero movies: the challenging political sentiments are not coming from the heroes they’re coming from the villains. And the provocative ideas they raise are initially paid lip-service to, then conveniently forgotten in the heat of the third-act battle.It happens again in Thor: Ragnarok. Yes, Cate Blanchett may be the goddess of death, Hela, but she reveals that Asgard’s wealth was built on colonial plunder. “Look at these lies,” she says, contemplating a medieval-looking ceiling fresco, “Goblets and garden parties, peace treaties. Odin, proud to have it, ashamed of how he got it.” She rips the fresco down to expose an older one underneath, showing scenes of violent conquest. “It seems our father’s solution to every problem was to cover it up,” she later says of Odin. Anyway, let’s have a big fight!Take another example, Michael Keaton’s Vulture, villain of Spider-Man: Homecoming. His salvage firm is put out of business when the contract to clean up New York after the last Avengers battle is handed to a public-private partnership between the US government and Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man. That’s Stark, the billionaire weapons manufacturer and corporate predator who inherited his wealth. “A lot of the assholes who made this mess are being paid to clean it up,” one of Vulture’s colleagues observes. He seethes with understandable contempt for Stark, the Avengers and the one percent. “Those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want,” he says. “We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything. They don’t care about us.” It’s a long way from, “You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us.”Taking this idea of class war even further, before backing out of it, was The Dark Knight Rises, the third film of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy. It was made at a time of the anti-globalisation Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, and class war was in the air. “When it hits, you’re all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us,” Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman tells Bruce Wayne (who, like Stark, is a hereditary billionaire arms-dealer).The villain, Tom Hardy’s Bane, bankrupts Wayne, exposes his political lies and provokes a popular uprising in Gotham City. At one point, he literally occupies Wall Street. “We take Gotham from the corrupt! The rich! The oppressors of generations who have kept you down with myths of opportunity, and we give it back to you … the people.” Again, you have to remind yourself that Bane is the bad guy. So does the movie: Bane’s rebellion devolves into show trials, executions and violence on the streets.As usual, Batman gets to be the hero, restoring order and sacrificing himself for the sake of the Gothamites (or at least that’s what they think). The superhero movie’s flirtation with radical politics – also known as “socialism” – turns out to be another red herring. As the philosopher Slavoj Žižek noted at the time: “The actual OWS movement was not violent, its goal was definitely not a new reign of terror insofar as Bane’s revolt is supposed to extrapolate the immanent tendency of the OWS movement, the film thus ridiculously misrepresents its aims and strategies.”This brings us up to Infinity War’s villain, Thanos. With a name like that, you know he’s not a good guy. But nor is he textbook evil. He doesn’t want to build an empire or amass wealth or any of the usual despotic bad-guy things. He just wants to restore balance to the universe, indiscriminately. You could call him a Malthusian extremist. “The universe is finite, its resources are finite.

Human existence is unsustainable. But Avengers gotta avenge. Rather than debating the validity of Thanos’s arguments and acknowledging that something ought to change, the superheroes once again fight tooth and nail to preserve the status quo.Avoiding spoilers, one thing Thanos’s rampage does achieve in Infinity War is to unite the ided factions of the Avengers.

The manager is the eternal optimist, always seeing the good in people and players, and when Alexandre Lacazette headed his team into a 61st minute lead, Wenger could begin to dream.The 68-year-old has not hidden his desire to walk away from his life’s work at Arsenal with the Europa League – it would be a first trophy of any description for him in Europe – and Lacazette, a former Lyon striker, had moved the club closer to the final, which, coincidentally, will be played in Lyon.It was a towering leap and wonderful finish, and it cut through the frustrations that Arsenal had felt against an Atlético Madrid team who played from the 10th minute with 10 men. Wenger’s players had created a fistful of chances during a barnstorming opening quarter only to lack a cutting edge and there was the sense that they were running out of ideas.At 1-0, the evening seemed a whole lot better for Wenger but it would come to feel a whole lot worse. He would later describe 1-0 as the “perfect” scoreline from a home first leg and all Arsenal needed to do was see it out. Wenger noted that Atlético could not get forward with their combination play and so their best chance was the long ball. Arsenal had to guard against it. But they could not.Laurent Koscielny had the position on Antoine Griezmann but he mucked up his attempt to hook the ball away in darkly comic fashion. It ricocheted off Griezmann and, suddenly, the striker was in.When his shot was saved by David Ospina and it broke back towards him, Shkodran Mustafi had taken up a good covering position. Then Mustafi slipped. The target looked a little bigger for Griezmann and he squeezed his shot home. Wenger has seen this movie before but its ability to traumatise is undiminished.“We can only look at ourselves,” the manager said. “We had the chances to be in the final tonight, we were not clinical enough and it’s a bitter taste. We created the anticlimax by giving the goal away and we’re now in a very difficult position.”Sime Vrsaljko’s early dismissal had shaped the tie, setting a combustible tone, and the Croatia right-back was certainly guilty of a rare form of recklessness, even if both of his cautions were defined by the strictest application of the law.The first was for a lunge at Jack Wilshere and with that in mind he ought to have thought twice about stretching into a tackle on Lacazette in a non-threatening area. He did not.Vrsaljko was late and trod on the top of Lacazette’s foot. He gave Clément Turpin a decision to make and the referee duly made it. The notion of a final warning so early in such a big game did not appear to enter his thoughts.David Ospina Had barely anything to do. Good in possession. Was the only one who did his job on the goal. Unlucky 6Héctor Bellerín Consistent outlet on the right. Made the visitors work, though delivery could have been better. 6Shkodran Mustafi The last man between Griezmann and goal, the German fell over. Always looked vulnerable. 4Laurent Koscelny (c) Had a decent game for the most part, maybe unlucky his clearance came back to him. But still. 5Nacho Monreal Matched Bellerín for an attacking presence and involved in goal. Also played Griezmann onside. 5Granit Xhaka The odd half-decent set-piece, but that was about it. Not nearly assertive enough. 4Aaron Ramsey Could have scored twice from headers, the rest of his game a bit loose. Worked hard. 6Mesut Özil The only forward who looked anything near sharp, but still did not deliver the end product. 6Jack Wilshere Assist for the goal, everything else was tidy to the point of inconspicuous. 6Danny Welbeck Imposed himself initially but ultimately never delivered the quality. Lost the ball for Griezmann’s goal. 5Alexandre Lacazette Scored with a powerful header but should have had more, especially in the first half. A frustrating night. 6Ratings by Paul MacInnesDiego Simeone was incandescent and moments later, after Héctor Bellerín had hacked at Lucas Hernández, the Atlético manager took his protests too far in demanding censure for the Arsenal right-back. Simeone was banished to the stands.Thereafter, he would pace about the back of the directors’ enclosure, a study in pent-up fury until the release of Griezmann’s equaliser. Simeone would refuse to criticise Turpin but he still managed to get his feelings across. He did not agree with the sending off.Jan Oblak Two fantastic saves from Lacazette and Ramsay. Everything else looked easy for the Slovenian. 8Lucas Hernández Came off second best in his duel with Bellerín but held his shape and kept his cool. 6Diego Godín (c) When Atlético were wobbling Godín stood firm with block after block. He has done this many times before. 8José María Giménez Followed the lead of his captain. One fantastic stretch to stop Özil, launched the ball for the goal. 7Sime Vrsaljko Earned two deserved bookings within 10 minutes of a crucial European fixture. Nothing more to say. 2Thomas Partay Went from midfield to right‑back after Vrsaljko’s departure and acquitted himself well. Assertive. 7Koke Saw little of the ball but ran his legs off to keep Arsenal from penetrating through the middle. 6Saúl Ñíguez Another display more about commitment than technical contribution, but that was what was needed 6Ángel Correa An irritant in the first half, as much for his theatrics as anything, disappeared in the second. 5Antoine Griezmann Far from his best game, but swung the tie. Willed his way past a wilting defence when it mattered. 7Kevin Gameiro Struggled to get into the match. Never properly linked up with Griezmann. 5Subsitutes: Gabi (for Gameiro 65) Calming presence from the old head proved important\u0026nbsp7.\u0026nbspFernando Torres (for Griezmann 85) NA.\u0026nbspSavic (for Correa 75) NARatings by Paul MacInnesArsenal had 28 shots to Atlético’s six and in the final analysis, they were left to rue their profligacy – together with the enduring excellence of Jan Oblak – particularly during their purple patch early on. Lacazette had two clear chances before the sending off – a volley that grazed the outside of a post and a header that extended Oblak.After Vrsaljko and Simeone had departed, Aaron Ramsey saw a shot blocked by Diego Godín Wilshere headed tamely at Oblak Danny Welbeck shot at the goalkeeper from a tight-ish angle and Koscielny, in yards of space after Lacazette had flicked on Granit Xhaka’s corner, stretched and sliced wide.Nacho Monreal also miscued a volley on 31 minutes as Atlético began to tighten up, but the visitors might have hurt Arsenal in the final part of the first-half. Twice Griezmann drew saves from Ospina.The breakthrough came after Griezmann ill-advisedly tried to play out from the back and was robbed by Monreal. Wilshere crossed and Lacazette scored his seventh goal in seven games. It was merely the prelude to heartache.Oblak produced a world-class save to keep out a Ramsey header at the end and Simeone was left to purr over a defensive performance that will “go down in Atlético’s European history”. Wenger and Arsenal are not out. Yet they most assuredly feel down."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b417b36fe67d1690ea7ef4f8031dd7ad57715983/0_342_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb40ecea39ea9be227c8f262ffb05b0d","title":"efl work with government safe standing","story":"The EFL has upped the ante in the continuing debate over safe standing, insisting it can work with the government to “bring it to fruition”.The Football League has long supported sections of stadiums being converted to allow fans to stand throughout matches. But a new survey of supporters, to be compiled before the end of the season, aims to build on a mandate already provided by Football League clubs. While the Premier League has described the topic as “complex and nuanced” the EFL’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, is now calling on the government to change its position on safe standing.“The EFL would like to see current legislation reviewed by the government and ultimately amended,” Harvey said in announcing the League’s new approach. “We would like clubs to have the opportunity to provide standing accommodation to their supporters at all matches played in the Championship, League One and League Two, should they wish to.”The EFL’s new emphasis on giving clubs the choice is an attempt to win the approval of Tracey Crouch, the sports minister. Crouch recently rejected a request by West Bromwich Albion to test safe standing and called the clamour for its introduction the opinion of a “vocal minority”.“We appreciate the pressure the sports minister is under and caution is natural,” Harvey said. “We need to establish an alliance, otherwise a disproportionate amount of the responsibility will fall on her. A partnership approach will commence with our survey, to demonstrate that those who attend fixtures want to see the change and be offered a choice, even if they still choose to be seated.“It’s not a new message, but it’s about structuring our approach to safe standing putting us at the front door with evidence that this is what the majority of fans want delivered. What we’re actually doing is starting the campaign to bring it to fruition.”Under current legislation, clubs in League One and Two that do not have fully seated stadia are allowed to let supporters stand. But since the Taylor report, clubs in the top two isions must have all-seated stadiums. An exception to this rule is that a club promoted to the Championship for the first time is granted a three-year grace period in which to convert the facilities.This means that, for example, Burton Albion currently have a standing terrace in the Championship.Other concerns over the implementation of safe standing include whether the allocation should be made available for away as well as home fans and what to do about persistent standing in areas that would remain designated as being seated. The survey launches online on 27\u0026nbspApril and will run until 10\u0026nbspMay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca1335753d8a7de4a83c8ad6783b402c2ee6757/0_95_2979_1788/master/2979.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86d6b893b17453931e6ca3269de029be","title":"fa sale wembley stadium shahid khan sign of the times","story":"Times change and the idea of an overseas billionaire taking over is now being seen as a workable solution to the FA’s money problemsThe Football Association’s proposed sale of Wembley stadium to the US car parts billionaire Shahid Khan was not greeted by a widespread shriek of patriotic indignation, perhaps illustrating how accustomed British people are now to crown jewels being sold overseas. Liverpool, thrillingly reconnecting with their European Cup-winning heritage and rampaging towards the Champions\u0026nbspLeague final, are owned by US sports franchise billionaires, as are Manchester United, Arsenal and other grand clubs including Fulham, which Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team, bought from Mohamed Al Fayed in\u0026nbsp2013.Fayed sold his other London landmark, Harrods, to Qatari state funds, which also owns the Shard and many prestigious chunks of the West End. The Premier League champions and large tracts of east Manchester are owned by the Abu Dhabi ruling family after decades in which no British investors could be found to arrest economic decline.At the same time, government investment in its own public responsibilities has been relentlessly cut, with sports facilities, swimming pools, public parks and playing fields inevitably falling victim. Before the 2010 general election, the then shadow Conservative sports minister, Hugh Robertson, expressed displeasure at a  article in which the Labour sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, proudly presented his government’s record of investment in school and public sports facilities and warned that the Tories would initiate cuts. Eight years on, as Sutcliffe predicted, hundreds of millions of pounds have been scythed from local authority budgets now struggling to maintain existing sports facilities, let alone modernise or build new ones.This is the context to the FA’s acknowledgement that it is considering a £500m-plus proposal from Khan to buy Wembley, and presenting it as a positive plan because it would spend the money on improving grassroots facilities. The new Wembley was built for £757m after serious financial difficulties, after the FA took ownership because its England matches and FA Cup semi-finals and finals provide the bulk of the income, and it has been a financial and administrative burden. Eleven years since the stadium finally reopened, with its new arch, 90,000 seats, Bobby Moore statue and girth of Club Wembley Club Wembley corporate feasting, the FA still owes £140m and Wembley makes a loss after paying the interest.The FA’s own history since it took charge of the Wembley project in 1999 has been turbulent, working through a series of chairmen and chief executives and repeatedly coming off worse in battles for governance authority with the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore. Gradually, however, the FA has focused more on the abject conditions in which the public has to play football and begun to explore the potential for improving\u0026nbspthings.Hence this proposed deal to sell Wembley and the FA’s careful presentation of it as an opportunity to release substantial, transformational money for public\u0026nbsp facilities.The argument is that having sweated for years to pay off the enormous debt on the new stadium, the FA has a prime asset in north London, still sucking in time and effort and whose value could be put to better use. If Khan, who has nursed a long-term project to bring the NFL and his Jaguars franchise more regularly to Wembley, were to buy it, the £500m-plus would be released for good works. This commitment at the outset of negotiations, that the bulk of the millions will go towards upgrading facilities, is the promise to which the FA must be held and against which it should be judged.The FA is making it clear it will still look to earn valuable money from playing matches at Wembley, retaining the Club Wembley receipts. In its most recently published accounts, for the year to 31 July 2016, the FA recorded £56.5m revenue from Club Wembley, 10-year packages having been sold to City firms and other corporate clients from the stadium’s opening. Last year Club Wembley packages were revamped to provide more luxury, reduce tenures to three seasons, and prices are now running from £2,148 for a seat per season to £11,064 in the One Twenty club and £37,200 – per person, per seat – in a private box.The FA is saying it will retain all this income and revert to playing matches on the basis it used to and on which most national teams do: pay rent to use the stadium and keep the money from the tickets. Khan will buy out the stadium itself, take the food and beverage revenue from the rest of it, and take on the burden of its\u0026nbspupkeep.The public money provided for Wembley’s rebuilding and the infrastructure around it: £79m from Sport England, £18m from the government, £17m from the London Development Agency and further smaller amounts making a total of £119m, will have to be repaid or an accommodation reached.For Khan, the attraction appears to be expanding the NFL into London and ensuring the Jaguars have pre-eminent rights to be the team who play there. While the NFL season is on, from September to January, the FA has accepted that England matches will not be played at Wembley and move around major club grounds instead, a prospect many fans are likely to welcome.During those months, traditionalists might avert their gaze from the goings-on within England’s national football stadium. But it is a sign of the times that the FA’s proposal itself is being entertained as a potentially workable idea to husband scarce resources, rather than dismissed with a cry of betrayal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e63af440e825a01960d11acc62b39926c5b5e2b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beb1b27d363688ced47dba98a0c7f201","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"There may be more pain for Wenger at Old Trafford, while Kane needs a rest and Saints look to ignite their survival bidArsène Wenger has experienced his fair share of unforgettable moments at Old Trafford, from that Marc Overmars winner in 1998 to Sylvain Wiltord’s title-clinching goal in 2002 – via his farcical adventure into the stands in 2009 – and it feels right that the Frenchman will get to enjoy one last bout with the team who shaped the greatest rivalry of his Arsenal career. Sir Alex Ferguson won’t join him on the touchline, of course, so Wenger will have to make do with his Portuguese best friend for company and there is bound to be plenty of nostalgia before the game. Yet it would be very out of character for José Mourinho to let any sentimental thoughts cloud his mind. United’s manager will not want his players to be merciful towards a team without an away point in 2018 – the kind of statement that underlines why Wenger is leaving. Mourinho will surely tell Alexis Sánchez to demonstrate why he had to leave Arsenal in January. Wenger, without a league win at Old Trafford since 2006, could be in for a long afternoon. JSSouthampton fans live in hope – not much, but a little – of extricating themselves from their current pickle, but the timidity of their team’s recent performances suggests relegation is a formality. A win against Bournemouth would give them some much needed confidence and a small chance of dragging themselves out of the abyss, but given the porousness of their defence, the glacial speed of their build-up play and reluctance to play a passing game in favour of slinging hopeful balls in the general direction of Charlie Austin andor Shane Long, it is difficult to see them troubling a Bournemouth side with little or nothing to play for. If Southampton are going to go down, they might as well go down swinging. If Mark Hughes is to avoid the ignominy of steering two different teams towards relegation this season, he needs to release the handbrake and just let his players play. Well, that or pray for a Stoke miracle. BGThere are certain managers who would instruct Stoke’s players to give their Liverpool counterparts a few meaty clatters early doors on Saturday to see whether they fancy a rumble before the second leg of the Champions League semi-final. Paul Lambert would surely not issue such an order but Jürgen Klopp may choose to keep many of his key players out of harm’s way all the same. Resting Mohamed Salah seems an obvious precaution but his most difficult decision is in midfield, where Liverpool have only three senior players available – which is why they should preserve them for the duel in Rome. That would be a boon for Stoke, whose best outfield players are all midfielders (Badou Ndiaye, Xherdan Shaqiri, Joe Allen and Moritz Bauer, a right-back who has been deployed in midfield in the last two matches). If Stoke were to muster their first league win at Anfield since 1959, that would be a fine thing for neutrals, simultaneously adding fresh intrigue to the race for the top four and the battle against relegation. PD Is the Carlos Carvalhal revival grinding to a halt at the worst possible moment? Swansea have picked up three points from five games since beating West Ham on 3 March and have failed to take advantage of a few winnable fixtures. They could find themselves just a point above the bottom three if results go against them this weekend, and perhaps the biggest concern before they host Chelsea is that the goals have dried up. With Tammy Abraham ineligible against his parent club, the onus is on André Ayew to show why Swansea paid £20m to bring him back to the Liberty Stadium in January. The Ghanaian forward has not scored since his move from West Ham. JSShould Swansea and Southampton embark on ridiculously implausible winning streaks, Huddersfield Town could need as many as seven points from their remaining four matches to guarantee the Premier League safety many “Einsteins” (but not this one) presumed would elude David Wagner’s promoted side. Last gasp Houdini acts are rare but not unheard of – in 2008, Bolton and Fulham electro-shocked themselves out of the bottom three at the expense of Birmingham City and Reading, despite having been in all sorts of bother with just a few games to go. Three points would almost certainly see Huddersfield safe, but they cannot afford complacency. With matches to come against Manchester City (a), Chelsea (a) and Arsenal (h), they will scarcely find three points easier to come by than those on offer at home against Sam Allardyce’s much and justifiably maligned Everton. BGThe emergence of Declan Rice has been a rare positive in a dreadful season for West Ham, but the teenage centre-back was the villain in Sunday’s 4-1 defeat at Arsenal. West Ham looked good for a point until the fatal moment when Rice chose to duck below Aaron Ramsey’s 82nd-minute cross, leaving a surprised Joe Hart with no time to stop the ball from drifting past him. David Moyes was unsparing in his criticism after the game, but mistakes are to be expected from young players. The Republic of Ireland international is regarded as an assiduous and eager character, which is just as well given that West Ham’s ridiculous lack of depth has forced the inexperienced 19-year-old to learn on the job. Rice is likely to keep his place when Manchester City visit the London Stadium on Sunday – mainly because there is nobody waiting to take it – and it will be fascinating to see how he fares against the rampant champions. JSNine days after the disappointment of their FA Cup semi-final defeat to Manchester United, Tottenham return to Wembley and must rouse themselves for the meat-and-potatoes drudgery of a league match against Watford. While radio phone-ins are probably not the most accurate barometer of fan opinion, Mauricio Pochettino will hope the general feeling of end-of-season ennui permeating the airwaves isn’t echoed in the performance of players who haven’t yet guaranteed their top four status. Harry Kane looks to be in dire need of a rest, whether it is through fatigue, a lack of fitness, a lack of form, or all of the above. After becoming the subject of much ridicule over his successful attempts to claim that goal against Stoke City, Kane’s obsession with winning the golden boot is in little doubt. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if he starts against a Watford side that has long since decamped to the beach, intrigued observers could be justified in asking who exactly has the final say when it comes to picking this Tottenham team. BGIt is a commonly held opinion that Southampton deserve to go down because they got ideas above their station when they jilted Claude Puel last season. But an increasing number of Leicester fans – and some players – are beginning to see what Southampton fans were complaining about. After an impressive start by the Frenchman there have been curious recurring features to Leicester’s performances in the last couple of months, including awful first halves, puzzling team selections (though recent omissions of Wes Morgan and Danny Simpson were understandable) and a tendency to leave Jamie Vardy isolated (which makes his scoring streak all the more impressive). If that form continues, then Leicester’s trip to Selhurst Park represents an excellent opportunity for Crystal Palace to gain the win that would effectively make them safe. For that to happen, James Tomkins and Mamadou Sakho will have to play as well as they did at Watford last week when Leicester stage their probable late rally. PDBrighton’s visit to Turf Moor constitutes something of an old boys’ reunion. Between them, Burnley players Stephen Ward, Chris Wood, Ashley Barnes and Sam Vokes played over 230 times for Brighton in the lower tiers before establishing themselves as valuable members of a squad threatening to upset the Premier League’s big-six hegemony. Eight of Brighton’s most recent starting XI helped the team secure promotion to the top tier last season, and look likely to keep them there. Both teams could do with all three points but they are unlikely to be crucial for either in the cosmic scheme of things. If nothing else, this encounter will go a long way towards proving that when the coaching is good enough, massive spending is not a pre-requisite for thriving in the Premier League. BGAt least West Brom have managed to salvage a smidgen of pride from this miserable campaign. Everything feels brighter now that Alan Pardew has left, which is strange, and the Premier League’s bottom side have taken five points from their first three matches under Darren Moore. Last weekend’s comeback against Liverpool probably only delayed the inevitable, but the belated discovery of some fight has lifted the mood before the summer and boosted Moore’s hopes of being given the job on a permanent basis. He deserves a chance, and another strong performance against Newcastle will make his case even more convincing.

Atlético Madrid were on the ropes, Diego Simeone was growling in the stands and for once it seemed that Wenger was not going to regret talking about a team with the potential to win the Europa League before this match.Yet the awkward truth for Arsenal’s eternal optimist is that the best teams show no mercy when the odds are stacked so heavily in their favour. This was an occasion that ought to have been remembered for a thrilling Arsenal performance, Alexandre Lacazette’s deft header and one of the most raucous atmospheres in the Emirates Stadium’s short history. Instead, it will live in the memory because of the generous defending that allowed Antoine Griezmann to steal a potentially decisive away goal and expose the fragility that explains why Wenger is leaving.This one could end up being even more painful than the Uefa Cup final defeat to Galatasaray in 2000 and the Champions League final defeat to Barcelona in 2006. Arsenal played against 10 men for 80 minutes and they could have killed the tie with sharper finishing and more maturity. Now, having burgled a 1-1 draw, Atlético will fancy their chances of reaching a fourth European final under Simeone.Wenger’s insistence that Arsenal deserved better was a familiar lament and his players will have to do it the hard way in next week’s second leg at the Wanda politano, where Atlético are a formidable proposition.It is not over yet, but a team without an away point in 2018 will need to produce a feat of tremendous defiance at one of Europe’s most intimidating venues.Will Arsenal rise to the occasion? It is hard to trust them. Their big players cannot hide. They will need more incision from Mesut Özil and more poise from their forwards. They cannot afford any more laxity from Laurent Koscielny and Shkodran Mustafi. Diego Costa, an unused substitute here, must be champing at the bit.There can be no more naivety. For while it is true that there was plenty to admire about the way Arsenal set about Atlético with ferocious intent in the early stages, it all felt a little too vague after Sime Vrsaljko’s red card for two rash fouls inside the first 10 minutes, with Wenger’s side guilty of not paying enough attention to detail in the key moments.Arsenal fed off the crowd’s emotion in their first European semi-final since 2009, but the killer touch eluded them. Lacazette had missed two glorious opportunities before Vrsaljko’s dismissal and Wilshere and Danny Welbeck both fluffed their lines when in front of the goal.Champions League finalists in 2014 and 2016, Atlético were there for the taking during the first 20 minutes, and Simeone’s mood was as dark as his outfit after seeing Clément Turpin dismiss Vrsaljko. When he erupted after Héctor Bellerín’s foul on Lucas Hernández in the 13th minute, the coach was sent from the touchline by the French referee.Yet Atlético relish these rearguard actions and the longer the game stayed goalless, the more anxious Arsenal grew. The Spanish team crept forward and Griezmann fired two warning shots before half-time. Arsenal had to regain their composure and they finally found a crack in the yellow wall just after the hour, Lacazette heading Wilshere’s cross past Jan Oblak. But disaster was on the way.“The task was clear for us,” Wenger said. “Not to be caught on the long ball.”And still Arsenal were caught by one hopeful punt in the 82nd minute. Griezmann won the chase with Koscielny and although David Ospina blocked the striker’s first attempt, he converted the rebound when Mustafi, the £35m German defender, fell over.The muted applause at the end spoke volumes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e42d885c5d5ba90acb65db97deb2e556cfa2b313/0_0_7150_4808/master/7150.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af7eb3dd473a58197f7d7ac33f10d606 1400w","title":"is it weird to eat the same sandwich for lunch every day","story":"Housing minister Dominic Raab’s food habits have sparked debate, but surveys show UK workers are repetitive eatersDid you eat the same thing for today’s lunch at work that you ate yesterday? We ask because a detail about sandwiches was one of the odder elements of a story about a Westminster security alert. A woman accused of meeting men via a “sugar daddy” website while working for parliament told the Daily Mirror that the housing minister, Dominic Raab, has exactly the same thing for lunch every day: a Pret a Manger chicken caesar and bacon baguette, with a pot of fruit and the same smoothie.But is this really that unusual?The statistics we have on how people choose to eat lunch at work are usually gathered by surveys, which can be unreliable, but all the indicators are that a significant proportion of the UK workforce eat the same thing for lunch every day. Whole Foods Market carried out a similar exercise four years earlier. It found that a third of Britons ate the same lunch daily, and half said they had been doing so for six years. Cheese sandwiches and ham sandwiches are apparently the favourites of a nation stuck in a lunchtime rut.There are upsides to repetitive eating. There’s a theory that because you become subconsciously bored of the meal, you eat smaller portions as a result. It can also help with budgeting: those purchasing the same thing each day can anticipate exactly how much they are going to spend on lunches. Another reason to stick to what you know might be to do with allergies – repeatedly ordering the same thing avoids the risk of unexpected ingredients. This may not be the case with Raab’s sandwich, however, since it contains seven items listed by Pret as possible allergens: gluten, sesame seeds, dairy, egg, celery, mustard and fish.Still, regardless of what you have for lunch at work, your habits will never be as eyebrow-raising as the man who claims he eats Christmas dinner every single day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8908436488bf99f8f3659b3ecfc42a57d3626829/892_1454_6214_3728/master/6214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704f47910abfed3ef413be0dbe1a98c0","title":"no stir risotto recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"Think risotto is all about endless stirring? Think again…I’m going to let you in on a little secret: despite what every nonna and Italian cookbook will tell you, you don’t need to chain yourself to the hob to make a decent risotto. The method below, which involves a mere two minutes of stirring, comes from a fourth-generation rice grower from the Veneto. And if it’s good enough for him …125ml white wine550ml stock3 tbsp butter ½ onion, peeled and chopped200g risotto rice, carnaroli or vialone nano ideally, though arborio will do25g parmesan, gratedBring the wine and 400ml of the stock to a simmer (chicken or vegetable are the most versatile, but ham, fish or beef may work better, depending on your choice of ingredients: if you’re using a stock pot or cube, which can be salty, taste and dilute as necessary before use). Red wine is sometimes used for risottos featuring beef or sausages.Over a medium-low heat, melt two tablespoons of the butter in a wide, shallow pan for which you have a lid (a wide pan means that more of the rice will come into contact with the stock, so it will cook more evenly). If you’re making a seafood risotto, or would simply prefer to keep the dish dairy-free, use extra-virgin olive oil instead.Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until it’s soft and golden make sure it doesn’t brown. Depending on what kind of risotto you’re making, once the onion has begun to soften, you could also chuck in finely chopped garlic, carrot, celery or pancetta, but leave any fresh herbs and other delicate ingredients until the end.Turn up the heat slightly and tip in the rice. Stir to coat with the butter and fry until it’s hot to the touch, without letting it colour. Use arborio rice, if that’s all you can find, but carnaroli and vialone nano are starchier, more robust varieties that are harder to overcook, so will produce a creamier result.Pour in the hot stock and wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and leave to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes – a good time for the cook to pour a glass of wine and put your feet up: once you’ve warmed the remaining stock, cut the rest of the butter into pieces and grated the cheese, that is.After 15 minutes, the rice should be almost tender, with just a hint of bite, and have absorbed all the cooking liquid. Add the butter (or oil) and the remaining 150ml stock to the pan, then stir for a couple of minutes, until the risotto is creamy but the consistency is still fairly loose.Stir in the grated parmesan (or pecorino, or any hard, dry cheese, or leave it out altogether, if you prefer, or if you’re making a seafood risotto). Either way, turn off the heat, cover the pan again and leave to sit for two minutes, then season to taste (a touch of nutmeg works well) and serve.This basic risotto is delicious on its own, or with cooked veg stirred through it (I had mine with wilted spinach and baked squash), but it’s easy to adapt. A classic Milanese risotto, say, is made with beef stock and a good pinch of saffron (add it to the final 150ml stock as it warms) and served alongside osso buco.Mushroom risotto can be made along the same lines, with meat or vegetable stock and the soaking liquid from dried porcini. As can, in just a few weeks’ time, asparagus risotto made with vegetable or chicken stock and a glug of asparagus cooking water. Note that fragile ingredients such as asparagus or seafood are best cooked separately and stirred into the risotto just before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e388b9953aec2cd0a8ba5ce2225dce95c1bcf2f/0_8_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b57ffa2aa732172ef2a9df84b84cc93","title":"etihad passport ticket name hyphen airline","story":"I have a hyphenated surname which is run together without the hyphen on airline tickets.This has never caused problems before, but recently I’ve been harassed at airports by Etihad Airways staff who have threatened to deny boarding because the name on the ticket does not match the hyphenated version on my passport.

Which? said its undercover investigation found that customer service representatives from Whirlpool and retailers AO, Argos, Co-op Electrical, Currys PC World, John Lewis and VeryLittlewoods were not giving the full safety advice when contacted about tumble dryer models subject to a safety notice. The six retailers’ customer service departments received 12 calls from Which?, asking for advice about burning smells coming from either a Hotpoint or Indesit model. Despite there being a known fire risk attached to these tumble dryers, the watchdog said the customer service representatives gave “inadequate, inconsistent and potentially dangerous advice”. Not a single call elicited what it would consider to be an acceptable response to a serious safety issue, it claimed.In nine out of 10 inquiries, the caller was not asked for a model code, despite safety alerts relating to the fire risk of these models. In the same percentage of cases, the customer service member failed to give the correct safety instruction, which is to unplug the device.In six out of 10 calls, the staff member also failed to advise the caller not to use the dryer until it had been repaired or replaced. In three out of the five calls transferred directly to Whirlpool, the customer service member incorrectly implied or explicitly stated that there would be a charge for repairing the machine. In only one of the five calls to Whirlpool did the operator give the correct safety advice, which is to unplug and not use the tumble dryer until it has been modified. Whirlpool issued a safety warning in 2015 after it found Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit dryers had a fault making them a fire risk. Earlier this year, a parliamentary report found that up to 1 million defective dryers were potential fire hazards in British homes due to Whirlpool’s “inadequate” response to the discovery of the defect. Which? is calling on the government’s office for product safety and standards to take action against Whirlpool, while demanding a full product recall of the affected tumble dryers, both modified and unmodified. “Whirlpool has admitted that there could be at least a million fire-risk tumble dryers in homes across the UK,” said Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services. “To discover that both retailers and Whirlpool are failing to give correct safety information to affected customers is shocking. We’ve been asking for these machines to be recalled for two years now and we have yet more evidence that Whirlpool and the government are not taking people’s safety seriously.”Whirlpool said in a statement that it had no evidence of any such calls and was therefore unable to verify them.“The instructions Which? claims were provided in these calls bears no resemblance to our advice on this product safety campaign, or the high standards we expect of our call centre staff. We take our responsibilities on product safety matters extremely seriously and all members of our customer care team are thoroughly trained to ensure they provide consumers with the correct advice.”It said it had a team of more than 300 professionals dedicated to taking over 3 million calls annually, “all of whom take great pride and care in providing advice and assistance to our valued customers”.AO said: “At AO, our customers’ safety is of paramount importance. We are surprised by the results of this research. We have contacted Which? for further details of these calls to help us better understand the context of each, so that we can investigate fully.” Argos said: “We have processes in place to support customers who call about product safety issues. We have asked Which? to provide the transcripts for the calls so we can understand if process was followed in this case.”Co-op Electrical said: “We have reminded all colleagues that should they receive any calls of this nature that they are to advise the caller to unplug the appliance.”” Currys PC World said: “We are disappointed to hear that Which? found our responses fell short of their benchmarks and have launched an urgent investigation. The safety of our customers is our top priority.” John Lewis said: “we take product safety and advice very seriously. When official advice was changed about these products at the start of 2017, we issued detailed guidance to all affected customers and also to our contact centres and shop partners. However we are disappointed that, in this instance, the recent advice given fell short of the high standards we set ourselves. As such, we are ensuring our contact centre partners are reminded of the process around handling calls relating to this issue.” VeryLittlewoods declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff6879f7de8e9323ce71a14c5b2f36fed477f50/0_0_2048_1365/master/2048.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60cf0e0e557435c48f50495c68548bb2 700w","title":"bulldoze the business school","story":"Visit the average university campus and it is likely that the newest and most ostentatious building will be occupied by the business school. The business school has the best building because it makes the biggest profits (or, euphemistically, “contribution” or “surplus”) – as you might expect, from a form of knowledge that teaches people how to make profits.Business schools have huge influence, yet they are also widely regarded to be intellectually fraudulent places, fostering a culture of short-termism and greed. (There is a whole genre of jokes about what MBA – Master of Business Administration – really stands for: “Mediocre But Arrogant”, “Management by Accident”, “More Bad Advice”, “Master Bullshit Artist” and so on.) Critics of business schools come in many shapes and sizes: employers complain that graduates lack practical skills, conservative voices scorn the arriviste MBA, Europeans moan about Americanisation, radicals wail about the concentration of power in the hands of the running dogs of capital. Since 2008, many commentators have also suggested that business schools were complicit in producing the crash.Having taught in business schools for 20 years, I have come to believe that the best solution to these problems is to shut down business schools altogether. This is not a typical view among my colleagues. Even so, it is remarkable just how much criticism of business schools over the past decade has come from inside the schools themselves. Many business school professors, particularly in north America, have argued that their institutions have gone horribly astray. B-schools have been corrupted, they say, by deans following the money, teachers giving the punters what they want, researchers pumping out paint-by-numbers papers for journals that no one reads and students expecting a qualification in return for their cash (or, more likely, their parents’ cash). At the end of it all, most business-school graduates won’t become high-level managers anyway, just precarious cubicle drones in anonymous office blocks.These are not complaints from professors of sociology, state policymakers or even outraged anti-capitalist activists. These are views in books written by insiders, by employees of business schools who themselves feel some sense of disquiet or even disgust at what they are getting up to. Of course, these dissenting views are still those of a minority. Most work within business schools is blithely unconcerned with any expression of doubt, participants being too busy oiling the wheels to worry about where the engine is going. Still, this internal criticism is loud and significant.The problem is that these insiders’ dissent has become so thoroughly institutionalised within the well-carpeted corridors that it now passes unremarked, just an everyday counterpoint to business as usual. Careers are made by wailing loudly in books and papers about the problems with business schools. The business school has been described by two insiders as “a cancerous machine spewing out sick and irrelevant detritus”. Even titles such as Against Management, Fucking Management and The Greedy Bastard’s Guide to Business appear not to cause any particular difficulties for their authors. I know this, because I wrote the first two. Frankly, the idea that I was permitted to get away with this speaks volumes about the extent to which this sort of criticism means anything very much at all. In fact, it is rewarded, because the fact that I publish is more important than what I publish.Most solutions to the problem of the B-school shy away from radical restructuring, and instead tend to suggest a return to supposedly more traditional business practices, or a form of moral rearmament decorated with terms such as “responsibility” and “ethics”. All of these suggestions leave the basic problem untouched, that the business school only teaches one form of organising – market managerialism.That’s why I think that we should call in the bulldozers and demand an entirely new way of thinking about management, business and markets. If we want those in power to become more responsible, then we must stop teaching students that heroic transformational leaders are the answer to every problem, or that the purpose of learning about taxation laws is to evade taxation, or that creating new desires is the purpose of marketing. In every case, the business school acts as an apologist, selling ideology as if it were science.Universities have been around for a millenium, but the vast majority of business schools only came into existence in the last century. Despite loud and continual claims that they were a US invention, the first was probably the École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris, founded in 1819 as a privately funded attempt to produce a grande école for business. A century later, hundreds of business schools had popped up across Europe and the US, and from the 1950s onwards, they began to grow rapidly in other parts of the world.In 2011, the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business estimated that there were then nearly 13,000 business schools in the world. India alone is estimated to have 3,000 private schools of business. Pause for a moment, and consider that figure. Think about the huge numbers of people employed by those institutions, about the armies of graduates marching out with business degrees, about the gigantic sums of money circulating in the name of business education. (In 2013, the top 20 US MBA programmes already charged at least $100,000 (£72,000). At the time of writing, London Business School is advertising a tuition fee of £84,500 for its MBA.) No wonder that the bandwagon keeps rolling.For the most part, business schools all assume a similar form. The architecture is generic modern – glass, panel, brick. Outside, there’s some expensive signage offering an inoffensive logo, probably in blue, probably with a square on it. The door opens, automatically. Inside, there’s a female receptionist dressed office-smart. Some abstract art hangs on the walls, and perhaps a banner or two with some hopeful assertions: “We mean business.” “Teaching and Research for Impact.” A big screen will hang somewhere over the lobby, running a Bloomberg news ticker and advertising visiting speakers and talks about preparing your CV. Shiny marketing leaflets sit in dispensing racks, with images of a erse tableau of open-faced students on the cover. On the leaflets, you can find an alphabet of mastery: MBA, MSc Management, MSc Accounting, MSc Management and Accounting, MSc Marketing, MSc International Business, MSc Operations Management.There will be plush lecture theatres with thick carpet, perhaps named after companies or personal donors. The lectern bears the logo of the business school. In fact, pretty much everything bears the weight of the logo, like someone who worries their possessions might get stolen and so marks them with their name. Unlike some of the shabby buildings in other parts of the university, the business school tries hard to project efficiency and confidence. The business school knows what it is doing and has its well-scrubbed face aimed firmly at the busy future. It cares about what people think of it.Even if the reality isn’t always as shiny – if the roof leaks a little and the toilet is blocked – that is what the business-school dean would like to think that their school was like, or what they would want their school to be. A clean machine for turning income from students into profits.What do business schools actually teach? This is a more complicated question than it first appears. Much writing on education has explored the ways in which a “hidden curriculum” supplies lessons to students without doing so explicitly. From the 1970s onwards, researchers explored how social class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality and so on were being implicitly taught in the classroom. This might involve segregating students into separate classes – the girls doing domestic science and the boys doing metalwork, say – which, in turn, implies what is natural or appropriate for different groups of people. The hidden curriculum can be taught in other ways too, by the ways in which teaching and assessment are practised, or through what is or isn’t included in the curriculum. The hidden curriculum tells us what matters and who matters, which places are most important and what topics can be ignored.In many countries, a lot of work has been done on trying to deal with these issues. Materials on black history, women in science or pop songs as poetry are now fairly routine. That doesn’t mean that the hidden curriculum is no longer a problem, but at least in many of the more enlightened educational systems, it is not now routinely assumed that there is one history, one set of actors, one way of telling the story.But in the business school, both the explicit and hidden curriculums sing the same song. The things taught and the way that they are taught generally mean\u0026nbspthat the virtues of capitalist market managerialism are told and sold as if there were no other ways of seeing\u0026nbspthe world.If we educate our graduates in the inevitability of tooth-and-claw capitalism, it is hardly surprising that we end up with justifications for massive salary payments to people who take huge risks with other people’s money. If we teach that there is nothing else below the bottom line, then ideas about sustainability, ersity, responsibility and so on become mere decoration. The message that management research and teaching often provides is that capitalism is inevitable, and that the financial and legal techniques for running capitalism are a form of science. This combination of ideology and technocracy is what has made the business school into such an effective, and dangerous, institution.We can see how this works if we look a bit more closely at the business-school curriculum and how it is taught. Take finance, for instance. This is a field concerned with understanding how people with money invest it. It assumes that there are people with money or capital that can be used as security for money, and hence it also assumes substantial inequalities of income and wealth. The greater the inequalities within any given society, the greater the interest in finance, as well as the market in luxury yachts. Finance academics almost always assume that earning rent on capital (however it was acquired) is a legitimate and perhaps even praiseworthy activity, with skilful investors being lionised for their technical skills and success. The purpose of this form of knowledge is to maximise the rent from wealth, often by developing mathematical or legal mechanisms that can multiply it. Successful financial strategies are those that produce the maximum return in the shortest period, and hence that further exacerbate the social inequalities that made them possible in the first place.Or consider human resource management. This field applies theories of rational egoism – roughly the idea that people act according to rational calculations about what will maximise their own interest – to the management of human beings in organisations. The name of the field is telling, since it implies that human beings are akin to technological or financial resources insofar as they are an element to be used by management in order to produce a successful organisation. Despite its use of the word, human resource management is not particularly interested in what it is like to be a human being. Its object of interest are categories – women, ethnic minorities, the underperforming employee – and their relationship to the functioning of the organisation. It is also the part of the business school most likely to be dealing with the problem of organised resistance to management strategies, usually in the form of trade unions. And in case it needs saying, human resource management is not on the side of the trade union. That would be partisan. It is a function which, in its most ambitious manifestation, seeks to become “strategic”, to assist senior management in the formulation of their plans to open a factory here, or close a branch office there.A similar kind of lens could be applied to other modules found in most business schools – accounting, marketing, international business, innovation, logistics – but I’ll conclude with business ethics and corporate social responsibility – pretty much the only areas within the business school that have developed a sustained critique of the consequences of management education and practice. These are domains that pride themselves on being gadflies to the business school, insisting that its dominant forms of education, teaching and research require reform. The complaints that propel writing and teaching in these areas are predictable but important – sustainability, inequality, the production of graduates who are taught that greed is good.The problem is that business ethics and corporate social responsibility are subjects used as window dressing in the marketing of the business school, and as a fig leaf to cover the conscience of B-school deans – as if talking about ethics and responsibility were the same as doing something about it. They almost never systematically address the simple idea that since current social and economic relations produce the problems that ethics and corporate social responsibility courses treat as subjects to be studied, it is those social and economic relations that need to be changed.You might well think that each of these areas of research and teaching are innocuous enough in themselves, and collectively they just appear to cover all the different dimensions of business activity – money, people, technology, transport, selling and so on. But it is worth spelling out the shared assumptions of every subject studied at business school.The first thing that all these areas share is a powerful sense that market managerial forms of social order are desirable. The acceleration of global trade, the use of market mechanisms and managerial techniques, the extension of technologies such as accounting, finance and operations are not routinely questioned. This is a progressive account of the modern world, one that relies on the promise of technology, choice, plenty and wealth. Within the business school, capitalism is assumed to be the end of history, an economic model that has trumped all the others, and is now taught as science, rather than ideology.The second is the assumption that human behaviour – of employees, customers, managers and so on – is best understood as if we are all rational egoists. This provides a set of background assumptions that allow for the development of models of how human beings might be managed in the interests of the business organisation. Motivating employees, correcting market failures, designing lean management systems or persuading consumers to spend money are all instances of the same sort of problem. The foregrounded interest here is that of the person who wants control, and the people who are the objects of that interest can then be treated as people who can be manipulated.The final similarity I want to point to concerns the nature of the knowledge being produced and disseminated by the business school itself. Because it borrows the gown and mortarboard of the university, and cloaks its knowledge in the apparatus of science – journals, professors, big words – it is relatively easy to imagine that the knowledge the business school sells and the way that it sells it somehow less vulgar and stupid than it really is.The easiest summary of all of the above, and one that would inform most people’s understandings of what goes on in the B-school, is that they are places that teach people how to get money out of the pockets of ordinary people and keep it for themselves. In some senses, that’s a description of capitalism, but there is also a sense here that business schools actually teach that “greed is good”. As Joel M Podolny, the former dean of Yale School of Management, once opined: “The way business schools today compete leads students to ask, ‘What can I do to make the most money?’ and the manner in which faculty members teach allows students to regard the moral consequences of their actions as mere afterthoughts.”This picture is, to some extent, backed up by research, although some of this is of dubious quality. There are various surveys of business-school students that suggest that they have an instrumental approach to education that is to say, they want what marketing and branding tells them that they want. In terms of the classroom, they expect the teaching of uncomplicated and practical concepts and tools that they deem will be helpful to them in their future careers. Philosophy is for the birds.As someone who has taught in business schools for decades, this sort of finding doesn’t surprise me, though others suggest rather more incendiary findings. One US survey compared MBA students to people who were imprisoned in low-security prisons and found that the latter were more ethical. Another suggested that the likelihood of committing some form of corporate crime increased if the inidual concerned had experience of graduate business education, or military service. (Both careers presumably involve absolving responsibility to an organisation.) Other surveys suggest that students come in believing in employee wellbeing and customer\u0026nbspsatisfaction and leave thinking that shareholder value is the most important issue, and that business-school students are more likely to cheat than students in other subjects.Whether the causes and effects (or indeed the findings) are as neat as surveys like this might suggest is something that I doubt, but it would be equally daft to suggest that the business school has no effect on its graduates. Having an MBA might not make a student greedy, impatient or unethical, but both the B-school’s explicit and hidden curriculums do teach lessons. Not that these lessons are acknowledged when something goes wrong, because then the business school usually denies all responsibility. That’s a tricky position, though, because, as a 2009 Economist editorial put it, “You cannot claim that your mission is to ‘educate the leaders who make a difference to the world’ and then wash your hands of your alumni when the difference they make is malign”.After the 2007 crash, there was a game of pass-the-blame-parcel going on, so it’s not surprising that most business-school deans were also trying to blame consumers for borrowing too much, the bankers for behaving so riskily, rotten apples for being so bad and the system for being, well, the system. Who, after all, would want to claim that they merely taught greed?The sorts of doors to knowledge we find in universities are based on exclusions. A subject is made up by teaching this and not that, about space (geography) and not time (history), about collectives of people (sociology) and not about iniduals (psychology), and so on. Of course, there are leakages and these are often where the most interesting thinking happens, but this partitioning of the world is constitutive of any university discipline. We cannot study everything, all the time, which is why there are names of departments over the doors to buildings and corridors.However, the B-school is an even more extreme case. It is constituted through separating commercial life from the rest of life, but then undergoes a further specialisation. The business school assumes capitalism, corporations and managers as the default form of organisation, and everything else as history, anomaly, exception, alternative. In terms of curriculum and research, everything else is peripheral.Most business schools exist as parts of universities, and universities are generally understood as institutions with responsibilities to the societies they serve. Why then do we assume that degree courses in business should only teach one form of organisation – capitalism – as if that were the only way in which human life could be arranged?The sort of world that is being produced by the market managerialism that the business school sells is not a pleasant one. It’s a sort of utopia for the wealthy and powerful, a group that the students are encouraged to imagine themselves joining, but such privilege is bought at a very high cost, resulting in environmental catastrophe, resource wars and forced migration, inequality within and between countries, the encouragement of hyper-consumption as well as persistently anti-democratic practices at work.Selling the business school works by ignoring these problems, or by mentioning them as challenges and then ignoring them in the practices of teaching and research. If we want to be able to respond to the challenges that face human life on this planet, then we need to research and teach about as many different forms of organising as we are able to collectively imagine. For us to assume that global capitalism can continue as it is means to assume a path to destruction.\u0026nbspSo if we are going to move away from business as usual, then we also need to radically reimagine the business school as usual. And this means\u0026nbspmore than pious murmurings about corporate social responsibility. It means doing away with what we have, and starting again.Shut Down the Business School: What’s Wrong with Management Education will be published by Pluto Press in May• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f63823ad1284afb5490ebd6fb21fc0207988b45e/0_0_5988_4016/master/5988.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc99152467417f6a0e66072d46593212","title":"cabinets brexiters push theresa may to drop customs partnership","story":"Boris Johnson among those who fear option would allow Britain to rejoin the customs union Theresa May’s Brexit inner cabinet are preparing for a showdown over the customs union next week, as leading Brexiters including Liam Fox and David Davis try to force the prime minister to ditch the “customs partnership” model.This so-called “hybrid model”, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, is regarded as cumbersome and impractical by Brexiters, who fear it would leave open the option that Britain could rejoin a customs union. It would also require the UK to access EU IT systems to levy duties, something Brussels is unlikely to accept. “The hybrid model is the unicorn model”, one senior Brexiter said.The group, backed by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, hopes to persuade the prime minister to throw her weight behind the alternative, the maximum facilitation (“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks.The customs union has become the most contentious issue in the debate about what kind of Brexit should be pursued, with many MPs regarding it as the only way of successfully avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland. Countries in the customs union levy tariffs on goods made outside the EU, but member countries trade with each other tariff-free and negotiate trade deals as a bloc. It is this “common commercial policy” that Brexiters are particularly exercised about, since it would prevent Britain from striking the sort of independent deals with non-EU countries that Fox, the international trade secretary, is pursuing.The government’s options have initially been rejected by Brussels negotiators, though Davis has insisted his team is ready to answer the EU27’s concerns.Leavers hope the Brexit inner cabinet will decide which of the two customs union options the government will adopt when it meets next week. The decision could then be ratified by the full cabinet, but proponents of the hybrid model are likely to try to keep it on the table.On Thursday, cabinet Brexiters were alarmed by comments from the home secretary, Amber Rudd, which appeared to leave open the possibility of remaining in the customs union.As MPs debated the issue in the House of Commons, Rudd was asked whether she would vote to remain inside if she were still a backbencher. “I am committed to the government’s position, which, to some extent, we are still working on,” she replied.Pressed on whether she thought it was more or less likely that the UK would stay in the customs union, Rudd said: “I’m afraid I’m not going to be drawn on that we still have a few discussions to have, in a really positive, consensual, easy way, among all my cabinet colleagues, in order to arrive at a final position”.One Whitehall source said: “Everyone knows where Rudd stands: there is a large part of the cabinet who see Brexit as a damage limitation exercise – and if they win the customs union battle, they will move on to the single market”.The home secretary quickly retreated, tweeting an hour after the lunch ended that she “could have been clearer” and “of course” the UK would leave the customs union.May’s spokesman later said: “It’s the position of the prime minister, the cabinet and the entire government that we will be leaving the customs union and be free to sign our own trade deals around the world.”But as a series of Conservative MPs stood up in the debate to express concerns about leaving the customs union, Rudd’s comments appeared to suggest the issue remains unresolved at the highest level of government.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “Amber Rudd appears to have let slip that discussions around the cabinet table about negotiating a customs union with the EU have not in fact concluded.“If that is so, then the prime minister should rethink her approach and listen to the growing chorus of voices in parliament and in business that believe she has got it wrong on a customs union.”The former education secretary Nicky Morgan warned the Conservatives against putting economic growth at risk: “This country is being asked to experiment at other people’s pleasure with a free trade policy when we do not know what the costs will be for constituents and businesses in this country.“And I say to my party – if we undermine and ignore the evidence for peace in Northern Ireland, and we undermine the business and financial security of people in this country, we will not be forgiven for a generation.”The debate has no direct influence on government policy, but was regarded as a gauge of Commons opinion before potentially crucial future votes on amendments to the customs and trade bills committing the government to trying to negotiate a new customs union.Some Brexiters are keen for May to force the issue to a vote in parliament, blaming the delay on over-cautious whips. One said that the chief whip, Julian Smith, was reticent to hold a vote too soon as “he doesn’t want to lose a career-ending vote”.They suggested that the government would, instead, wait until it was in a stronger position once the Brexit white paper had been published, the local elections were out of the way and they could see how May’s poll ratings were holding up.A senior Tory source acknowledged there would be some Tory remainers who would never be won over. “You could promise them free sex and chocolate and they still wouldn’t vote for Brexit.”No 10 said there was “a discussion around the issue of which two customs options the government opts for – but are we leaving the customs union? The answer is categorically yes.”Both options set out in May’s Mansion House speech in March were still on the table, the spokesman said. “But as we move forward, you can expect there to be a single option,” he said. “Neither of the options are a customs union.”Asked about next week’s Brexit war cabinet, he said: “The strategy and negotiations committee is the government’s steering group in relation to Brexit. I won’t discuss that committee in advance.” understands that a white paper setting out the government’s negotiating position for the future economic partnership will be published next month in a bid to unblock talks in Brussels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/063f064f00017bda37769e99203863e68dad8e63/118_335_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=501cd4f8de5635f26ab6e571d8e65fe9","title":"salford st helens super league match report","story":"After less than a year in a St\u0026nbspHelens shirt it is already clear Ben Barba’s time in Super League could be limited – which perhaps makes it important on nights such as this to sit back and marvel at what a magnificent talent has blessed British rugby league.Barba, 28, may well have arrived on these shores in auspicious circumstances last June, with a 12-match drug ban to serve before he could even make his debut for the club – but whenever he leaves, be it at the end of this season or next, he will do so having established himself as one of the competition’s finest talents.St Helens have not been short of outstanding Australian recruits down the years with the likes of Mal Meninga and, more recently, Jamie Lyon representing one of the game’s most famous clubs with real distinction. Barba’s position among that company appears to be more and more likely, with this latest masterclass tempered only by a shoulder injury which led to the full-back being withdrawn with seven minutes remaining. By then the job had long since been done.Barba’s first hat-trick as a St\u0026nbspHelens player – which lifts his try tally to 15 for the season – told only half the story in terms of his all-round performance, as he not only further helped to underline the Saints’ position as mid-season favourites for the title but also shortened his own odds for the Man of Steel award. Right now it is fair to argue nobody is even close to him in that race.Salford will undoubtedly attribute a large portion of this thumping scoreline to Barba and St\u0026nbspHelens, but this was a frustrating evening all round for the home side. Unable to take advantage of the fact they played with a man advantage for the second half after Matty Lees of Saints was shown a red card, the Red Devils were ultimately well beaten here.“They’re playing outstanding,” the home coach, Ian Watson, said of the Super League leaders. Even with the dismissal of Lees for a dangerous tackle four minutes before the interval, by then the game was as good as won for the visiting side.There were six St\u0026nbspHelens tries in the first half, with Barba having a major hand in almost all of them – including the pick of the game when, with Salford pressing to reduce the 22-6 lead, the Australian plucked an errant pass from Josh Wood in midair and raced the length of the field.Eight minutes later he had scored his first following a fine break from Regan Grace, who epitomised Saints’ dominance on proceedings even with a man disadvantage, when he raced over on the stroke of half‑time to open up a commanding 32-6 lead.For Salford there was no let-up from Barba and St\u0026nbspHelens after the interval. The Australian and Grace combined yet again shortly after half-time to feed the talented Welsh winger for his second try, and after Jonny Lomax and Mark Percival combined to send the latter over Barba sealed his hat-trick by touching down Lomax’s kick.There were further tries for Theo Fages and Ryan Morgan but before those scores, Barba was withdrawn after falling awkwardly on the shoulder while trying to offload. Both he and Saints face a nervous few days to determine the extent of that injury. It was the only sour note from another resounding victory for the Super League leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc53d0bea78910c8135fe256d87d0c51153b5d1f/0_427_4962_2978/master/4962.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d606def35715646182678e0001a8dc2","title":"nfl draft baker mayfield ryan shazier","story":"The Cleveland Browns used the first overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft to select Oklahoma Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Baker Mayfield.“The guy knows how to play, knows how to win,” Browns general manager John Dorsey said on Thursday night after his decision to go for Mayfield was given a tepid reception from the Browns’ live draft party patrons. Meanwhile, in the evening’s most memorable moment, injured Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier announced Pittsburgh’s first-round pick, limping slowly onto the stage with help from his fiancee. Shazier sustained a serious back injury and underwent surgery in December with concerns about whether he would walk again. He called out the name of safety Terrell Edmunds of Virginia Tech. Shazier, whose future in football is uncertain at best, was introduced by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and received strong applause from the fans. Edmunds’ younger brother, linebacker Tremaine Edwards, also of Virginia Tech, was selected 16th overall by Buffalo. It’s the first time brothers have gone in the first round of the same draft. “That’s a huge lift not only for him but for us,” Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert said of Shazier’s appearance. “To see where he has come from to where he is and knowing where he might be able to go, it’s beyond inspirational.” Cleveland threw a curveball with their No4 selection, taking Ohio State cornerback Denzel Ward. Dorsey said Ward’s excellence in press-man coverage is the perfect fit for Gregg Williams’ defense. A shake-up in the draft order occurred after the Colts’ drafted sixth. Tampa Bay traded the No7 pick to Buffalo – who drafted Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen – for the Bills’ first-round pick and two second-round selections. The Bills also got the Buccaneers’ seventh-round pick.With the No2 pick, the New York Giants selected running back Saquon Barkley. Barkley, considered by many analysts as the top player in the draft, will join an offensive unit that includes Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. At No3, the Jets went for a quarterback, choosing Southern Cal’s Sam Darnold, who before only a few days ago appeared to be a lock as the top overall choice. Jets general manager Mike Maccagnan said Thursday night he saw Darnold play live five times last season. Darnold was the first quarterback drafted this high by the Jets since Joe Namath went first overall in 1965. Darnold will go to a team desperately in need of a quarterback as a building block. Thought to be a Heisman Trophy candidate entering the season, Darnold’s performance suffered in 2017 while playing behind an inexperienced line and with young wide receivers.Another trade put the Arizona Cardinals at No10, in position to select UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen. The Cardinals made a trade with the Oakland Raiders to move up six spots. Perhaps the most surprising move came from New Orleans, who moved up – sacrificing next year’s first-round pick – in a deal with the Green Bay Packers to select UTSA pass rusher Marcus Davenport. The Packers traded again to rise from the 27th pick received from the Saints to 18th and select Louisville cornerback Jaire Alexander. With the final pick of the first round, Baltimore traded with Philadelphia and took the fifth quarterback and second Heisman Trophy winner of the first round. Lamar Jackson was selected No32 overall. Jackson won the Heisman in 2016 and finished third in the voting last season. 21) Cincinnati (from Buffalo), Billy Price, C, Ohio State 22) Tennessee (from Kansas City through Buffalo and Baltimore), Rashaan Evans, LB, Alabama 23) New England (from LA Rams), Isaiah Wynn, G, Georgia 24) Carolina, DJ Moore, WR, Maryland 25) Baltimore (from Tennessee), Hayden Hurst, TE, South Carolina"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3363574f14efc121f0c18c74c82da23e335cba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=850523f72bf7d18eb6b4a604a7018ea5","title":"shahid khan buying wembley would move nfl london team step closer to reality","story":"On the morning Shahid Khan increased his profile in the London sports scene, he sat in the headquarters of the Jacksonville Jaguars and laughed into the phone. It was a great roaring laugh that lingered even as he began to speak.“If you know the NFL, you know you don’t choose them they choose you,” the Jaguars and Fulham owner told the  on Thursday.He was speaking about the elite society of 32 NFL team owners who form one of the most exclusive clubs in sport, overseeing a $14bn operation. Their selectivity in who they allow to buy a franchise is legendary, as evidenced by their famous refusal of Donald Trump’s bid to buy the Buffalo Bills. Each owner must add something to their group – many of whom are part of families that have owned their teams for years. Khan’s, it seems, is in the dual lives he has planted in the US and UK.For more than a decade the NFL has been serious about expanding globally, fearing that while it is the most lucrative league in the world its popularity does not stretch much beyond the US. Several league executives and team owners have told the  in recent years they are committed to seeing whether a franchise could be placed in London full‑time.Given that Khan – who was raised in Pakistan and the US and spends considerable time in London – also owns a precarious NFL franchise with limited resources, he has been viewed as an obvious link to make the NFL’s aspirations come true. The fact he has embraced London, committing the Jags to an annual game at Wembley, has only raised that perception.The announcement of his £500m-plus proposal to buy Wembley stadium immediately sounded alarm bells that he may be looking to move the Jaguars to London, which has become a regular host of NFL games.While he did not make a promise to keep them in Jacksonville, he was quick to say “it is too early” to determine whether an NFL team would work in London full-time. He then added “this is a step to stabilise the Jaguars” in Jacksonville. He said he hopes to have them play a second game each season at Wembley and believes doing so will be key to the team’s success in Florida, which is home to two other NFL franchises. “How do we grow?” the 67-year-old asked. “Most football fans in north-west Florida are not Jaguar fans because they are from somewhere else. We have to work hard to find football fans.”London, he believes, offers an opportunity to grow that base. He added that the team’s international profile has grown, especially since the Jags ended years of losing with a run that left them just short of this year’s Super Bowl. He said the team is “one of the five most recognisable” NFL franchises overseas and their merchandise outsold the other 31 teams internationally in November and December. He said these gains offset the limits of Jacksonville, which is the NFL’s seventh-smallest market.Khan has been speaking with the FA for more than a year, ever since worries arose around the Jaguars that a sale of Wembley to a group uninterested in the NFL may take away the one obvious spot for the league to play most of its London games. As talks expanded, team officials realised the potential of keeping the revenue from food and beverage sales of not only Jaguars games at Wembley but also from all events. They also liked the idea of no longer paying rent at the stadium.But his interest in London makes Jacksonville fans nervous he intends to move the team. He was something of a mystery when he bought the Jags in 2012. He had not been a major player in US sports. Forbes Magazine has labelled him the NFL’s fourth-richest owner – with an estimated worth of anywhere between $5bn and $7bn, grown through his ownership of the car-parts company Flex-N-Gate – a firm for which he worked as a student at the University of Illinois.His purchase of the Jaguars for $760m was not a surprise. He had tried to buy a majority stake in the Rams, then in St\u0026nbspLouis, two years before. He became the league’s first non-white and Muslim owner. And he immediately gained a profile as an American comfortable in London, establishing the Jags as the NFL franchise regularly playing in the UK. “I love sports,” he said on Thursday, gushing repeatedly about Wembley’s prestige, calling the stadium’s name “holy” to him. He also said Wembley is “underutilised” and promised to bring renovations that would make it a more desirable facility.Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, has made figuring out London a priority and one source told the  that several years ago, before Khan bought the team, Goodell had expressed concerns about Jacksonville’s viability as an NFL market in private meetings.While Khan and Jaguars officials were careful to say a Wembley purchase will only help the market, an NFL team owning a London stadium makes the whole idea of a full‑time London team a bigger possibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a292a09b2bf9f66c0577e8c5b5e371b7d33d2b/159_0_2785_1673/master/2785.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2862d0b8497dc525a2568b36df5af206","title":"snapchat new spectacles launch","story":"Only 220,000 units of wearable gadget were sold first time around, with the tech firm writing off $40m in the processSnap is doubling down on its hardware business, launching a new version of its Spectacles camera-glasses today with a better camera, the ability to take still images and water resistance.The new model comes as Snapchat attempts to recover from the disappointing long-term fate of the first generation, which gathered attention – and long queues – when they were launched in extremely limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell in large numbers when they were eventually released on general sale. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap sold just 220,000 units, the company says, eventually writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40m.This time round, the new Spectacles will be available from Snap’s website, at a price of £149.99, and are launching simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and France, and more widely across Europe the following week.Snap’s decision to recommit to Spectacles has come as a surprise, as many competitors are shifting away from smart glasses in general. Intel launched its own product, a pair of specs that use lasers to shine information directly into wearers’ eyes, in February this year, but had cancelled the project by April, noting that new technologies “sometimes require tough choices when market dynamics don’t support further investment”. Similarly, the Google Glass smart spectacles, launched in 2013, famously earned its wearers the sobriquet “Glasshole”, and the company eventually stopped producing the device in 2015.Snap says the focus on hardware is a critical part of its future. Co-founder Evan Spiegel describes Snap as a “camera company” first and foremost, and Snap argues that that doesn’t just mean tools for taking photos and videos, but also features that enable “augmented reality” technology, and new ways to interact with digital elements in the physical world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba44d330d9e3e834d9b5131aead59dca854a3934/0_0_3924_2355/master/3924.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=940c43f9f13fbe31c3343232caa6e299","title":"kim dotcom seeks top notch chef and counter intelligence staff for new house","story":"Dotcom, a German national with New Zealand residency, has moved from Auckland to the tourist hub of QueenstownKim Dotcom, the founder of file-sharing company Megaupload, is advertising for live-in staff in his New Zealand mansion and the eclectic team, including a chef and counter-intelligence officer, he is recruiting will make for a lively household.Dotcom, a German national who has permanent residency in New Zealand, shifted south from his longtime base in Auckland to the tourist hub of Queenstown in the lower South Island last year, citing a desire to get away from “spies” and raise his children among mountains and lakes.Last year a decision by Hong Kong’s high court meant Dotcom was able to access frozen assets, property and cash, which he credits with funding his family’s relocation. Dotcom has five children and a new wife, 22-year-old Elizabeth. Queenstown and the southern lakes region, a longtime playground for the rich and famous, have also become popular with silicon valley entrepreneurs and billionaire preppers.The PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel owns land by Lake Wanaka, and former Today show host Matt Lauer owns a farm an hour’s drive from Queenstown.Dotcom said Queenstown and New Zealand generally were appealing refuges from the increasingly turbulent and unstable global environment. “The main reason I decided to move to New Zealand over a decade ago was because of the global danger and New Zealand’s distance from potential global conflict,” Dotcom told the .“I think New Zealand is greatly positioned far away from all of the trouble in the northern hemisphere and I am a believer that we are going to have another great war at some stage because history repeats itself and humanity hasn’t really learnt much from its past mistakes.”Since settling in Queenstown Dotcom has been tweeting regularly, and is now recruiting for a range of positions.“Who wants to come and live with the Dotcoms in Queenstown?” he said in a twitter post seeking a Michelin-starred chef, a German teacher and security personnel.Dotcom said he had received “several hundred” applications for the positions, and his shortlist would now be vetted by his security team. Unsurprisingly Dotcom had received the least number of applicants for the Zeppelin pilot position, a job he was trying to fill for a possible tourist venture in the scenic southern lakes.The DJ and sound engineer was being hired to work with Dotcom on an upcoming album: “it is not a DJ for partying purposes, it is a DJ for music production”. The post attracted hundreds of retweets and comments on Twitter. One said he was “a very good carpenter”. “I can also double as a bodyguard as I’m efficient with a nail gun. You’re welcome.” Another said: “Executive protection is the only thing I have extensive experience with. However I do make a mean lasagna.” It is six years since Dotcom, a self-described “internet freedom fighter”, was arrested in a dramatic police raid on his mansion near Auckland after the FBI shut down Megaupload’s servers.Dotcom claimed Megaupload was a genuine file-sharing site that did its best to police copyright infringement but had 50 million daily users and could not control every aspect of its activity.Dotcom has accused US authorities of pursuing a vendetta against him on behalf of Hollywood studios.The FBI alleges Megaupload netted more than US$175m in criminal proceeds and cost copyright owners more than US$500m by offering pirated content.

In 1892 three black men, co-owners of a store giving white businesses a run for their money, were attacked, fought back and were arrested. They never stood trial. A white mob broke into the jail, dragged them away and lynched them.The murders were grieved by their friend Ida B Wells, an African American teacher, journalist, civil rights pioneer and suffragist about whom it was once said: “She has plenty of nerve she is as smart as a steel trap, and she has no sympathy with humbug.” Wells was galvanised to count, investigate and report lynchings in America as no one had done before, hurling her 5ft frame into hostile territory with all the fearlessness of a war reporter.For a century she has languished as an unsung heroine, overshadowed by more familiar giants of the civil rights movement. In recent years, however, her crusading activism and muckraking techniques are being rediscovered. A society for investigative reporting bears her name the New York Times – which once branded her “a slanderous and nasty-minded mulattress” – just published a belated obituary, and there are moves to name a street after her in New York and build a monument in Chicago.“I consider her my spiritual grandmother,” says Nikole Hannah-Jones, an investigative journalist covering civil rights. “She was was a trailblazer in every way ... as a feminist, as a suffragist, as an investigative reporter, as a civil rights leader. She was just an all-around badass.”Wells was born into slavery in Holly Springs, Mississippi, during the civil war. She was orphaned at 16 after her parents – as well as a younger brother – died from a yellow fever epidemic. She found work as a teacher to support her five remaining siblings, then moved to Memphis, where she became a leading journalist and civil rights activist.At 21, Wells clashed with a white train conductor who ordered her to move from the ladies’ car to the a section designated for black passengers, despite her having bought a first class ticket. When she refused and the conductor tried to forcibly move her, Wells “fastened her teeth on the back of his hand”, as she wrote later. Wells sued after being ejected from the train and won the case (a newspaper headline declared “Darky damsel gets damages”), though the decision was later reversed in court.By the time Wells turned 25, she was the co-owner and editor of the Free Speech and Headlight, a local black newspaper, a platform she used to skewer racial inequality. Then came the People’s Grocery Lynching. She denounced it in print, armed herself with a pistol and spent months traveling alone in the south, researching more than 700 lynchings from the previous decade.Some 4,075 African Americans were lynched in 12 southern states between 1877 and 1950, according to the Equal Justice Initiative’s 2015 report, Lynching in America. Some were witnessed by big crowds who brought children and picnic baskets, as if at a public entertainment.Wells’s great-granddaughter, Michelle Duster, an author and public speaker, says: “They would torture people before they were killed and dismember them afterwards and pass around the body parts. It was shocking to me that people would take bones as souvenirs. The more I learned about the level of violence, the more I appreciated what it took for her to do what she did. I am just amazed.”Wells visited places where people had been hanged, shot, beaten, burned alive, drowned or mutilated. She examined photos of victims hanging from trees as mobs looked on, pored over local newspaper accounts, took sworn statements from eyewitnesses and, on occasion, even hired private investigators.It was astoundingly courageous work in an era of Jim Crow segregation and in which women did not have the vote. Hannah-Jones, who writes for the New York Times Magazine, says: “There was no protection from the law for a black woman who was going into territories where black people had been stolen from the jail and lynched with the help of law enforcement. “These places would have been hostile to a black person questioning these communities at all, but think about the types of emotion in a community that has just lynched someone and strung their body up for public display and then to have a black woman come in there asking questions. One has to ask: ‘Would I have the courage to do that?’ There was no help that was going to come for you. There was no protection from the law. Black folks didn’t even have a lot of legal rights and they certainly didn’t have much protection from law enforcement.”Wells, however, was a force of nature who once said, “One had better die fighting injustice than die like a dog or a rat in a trap.” On another occasion, she wrote: “I had already determined to sell my life as dearly as possible if attacked. If I could take one lyncher with me, this would even up the score a little bit.”She destroyed the mainstream media’s narratives that suggested lynching victims were criminals – often rapists of white women – who got their just desserts. Her reporting showed that rape had not been alleged in two thirds of the lynchings or was only alleged after a covert, consensual, interracial relationship had been exposed.Duster says: “She was putting names to stories and names to statistics. She was putting context into what was happening. Without what she did, it was pretty much ‘OK, this person committed a crime, they got what they deserved.’ She said, ‘No, they did not commit a crime.’ The narrative of the mainstream media at this time was very different from the reality she found on the ground.”Hannah-Jones adds: “Much like the killing of black people by police today, the ‘official’ story of lynchings was just largely accepted, which was that black men were rapists and that unknown vigilantes were just meting out justice to black brutes. You can look at the way that newspapers covered these things and that was just accepted and Ida B Wells exposed the reality behind lynchings, which is that they were often used as economic retaliation.“They were used to sow fear in black communities so that black people would stay in their place and she exposed the truth about that. She also exposed that while law enforcement would often say they these lynchings occur ‘at the hands of parties unknown’, everyone in town knew who committed them and often law enforcement took part.”While Wells was out of town, a mob destroyed her printing press in Memphis and threatened to kill her if she returned. She stayed away from the south for more than three decades but toured the US and UK, raising awareness through public speaking. In 1895 she published a pamphlet, the Red Record, the first statistical record of the history of American lynchings, a forerunner of data journalism projects such as The Counted, the ’s project to document people killed by police.Hannah-Jones says: “She was one of the first people to actually tally the number of lynchings that were happening. We like to say she was one of our early data reporters. She began to collect data on this to show how actually vast the scope of the problem was.”When Wells died in 1931 at the age of 68 from a brief illness due to kidney failure, her influence was waning, her autobiography was unfinished and her ambition of a federal anti-lynching law was unrealised. Duster muses: “She went out with a whimper. She was almost obsolete. She writes in her autobiography that there was a generation who didn’t know who she was and didn’t know about lynching. She wrote the book to stop it being forgotten.”“I think her being a woman, and a black woman, were things that pretty much guaranteed her obscurity. She was also written out of the suffrage movement even though she played a huge role in it and was trying to push the white suffragists on racial equality. Both her gender and her race are the reasons why she was largely written out of history.”But now she is inspiring a new generation of women in journalism.

As they inspected a guard of honour, a military band played Korean folk songs familiar to people on both sides of the border and South Korea’s version of Hail to the Chief.In early accounts of the closed morning session given by South Korean officials, Kim told Moon that he “won’t interrupt your early morning sleep any more” with ballistic missile tests. Moon said there had been “very good discussion today”.After entering the Peace House, the venue for the talks, Kim wrote in the guestbook: “New history starts from now, at the historic starting point of an era of peace.”Moments later, in an adjacent meeting room, he said he wanted to hold “heartfelt, sincere and honest” talks, and hoped the summit would produce a “good outcome”. “I hope to write a new chapter between us, this is the starting point for us. We will make a new beginning,” added Kim, seated next to his increasingly influential sister, Kim Yo-jong.“It has taken 11 years for this historic moment to happen. Walking here, I wondered why it has taken so long.“Through today’s meeting, I hope we won’t go back to square one again and that there won’t be a repeat of the non-implementation of what we agree,” he added, referring to failed past deals on nuclear weapons and inter-Korean co-operation. “I hope we can live up to people’s exceptions.”Earlier a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, as well as spraying what appeared to be disinfectant in the air, on the chairs and on the guest book, according to Reuters.More substantive talks got under way behind closed doors in a room that was specially refurbished in anticipation of Kim’s visit. The two leaders sat exactly 2,018 millimetres apart – in a nod to the year of their historic summit – on opposite sides of a specially designed table with gentle, rounded edges. They sat on chairs with backrests that feature a Korean peninsula design.Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will join her husband, Moon and his wife, Kim Jung-sook, for the dinner after the talks have ended, South Korean officials said. Ri, a former singer who was recently given the title of first lady, will be making her second appearance at a leadership summit, having accompanied Kim on his trip last month to Beijing, where they met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.Moon, a left-leaning liberal who has long supported engagement with the North, said the whole world was paying attention to the “spring” that had arrived on the Korean peninsula, and described their meeting as both an “opportunity” and a “burden”.“People around the world have high hopes,” said Moon, who was elected president last May promising to defuse the growing nuclear crisis on the peninsula. “Your visit makes the military demarcation line a symbol of peace, not ision. I thank you very much for your courage. Our dialogue and talks today will be very frank. We will finally have the dialogue we haven’t been able to have for the past decade.”The details of their talks will not be clear until later on Friday, and some analysts predicted the meeting, while highly symbolic, would produce little of substance on denuclearisation and a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that brought a halt to the Korean war 65 years ago.“It’s high on symbolism and definitely exciting, but you have to ask yourself what does the symbolism amount to?” said Van Jackson, a former policy adviser to the US secretary of defence who focuses on Asia. “Both men have a strong desire to make this look good, but I don’t see anything coming out of this except building momentum for a Kim-Trump meeting.”Kim wants to be a normal, upstanding and respected member of the international community, but wants to do that while having nuclear weapons, Jackson said, adding any meeting with Trump would aid in furthering that goal.“It’s great to have good vibes going into the Trump summit, but you need to put emotion aside and wonder what this means on the question of nukes, which is not much,” he said. “Kim says he wants peace and denuclearisation, but what that means to him won’t be acceptable to South Korea or the US.”Other countries welcomed the first meeting between the countries’ leaders for more than a decade. The White House said in a statement: “We wish the Korean people well. We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress to where a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean peninsula. The US appreciates the close coordination with our ally, the Republic of Korea and looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong-un in the coming weeks.”Japan’s defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said Tokyo hoped the summit would lead to demonstrable progress on North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes, and a resolution of the regime’s cold war abductions of Japanese nationals. “Japan will be watching closely for signs that North Korea is taking action on these issues,” he said.Kim Chang-su from the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses, said the leaders’ greeting made him optimistic about the summit. Referring to the leaders’ brief moment on North Korean soil, he said: “It’s very surprising, but that’s a sign of harmony, rather than just one side forcing these talks on the other. It was a bold gesture by Kim Jong-un.“So far these seem to be very open minded discussions, a sign that we are heading to a new era of peace.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3ae3c3602149591a9b448a4828a1dae3cba87f/0_0_3500_2342/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5ee493f20a6908341baae9edecca007 700w","title":"north and south korea summit leaders prepare for historic inter korean meeting live","story":"Kim Jong-un and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, come face to face at the inter-Korean meeting in the demilitarised zone.

Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs said in response to questions at a press conference, “We have all seen the summit on television. We applaud the leaders of DPRK and South Korea for this historic step and express appreciation for the decisiveness and courage they displayed.”“Through difficult times and conflict, we are still brothers. All the past resentment goes away after we smile at each other,” Hua said. Hua said China looked forward to this historic meeting as an opportunity to further long-term peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.An editorial from Chinese state news agency Xinhua was in contrast quite florid, calling on the need for both sides to “keep talking.” “The historic scene brought the dawn of peace. The related parties will need to show kindness, sincerity, patience, and caution. Complete sincerity can break even metal and stones.”The editorial added, “As long as we work hard, the issues will be resolved. If we continue to talk, the ice will melt. The day of spring and flowers in bloom will come.”The two leaders are still talking seriously but animatedly, even though the eyes of the world are on them. Against the leafy backdrop and with the serene atmosphere, you would never know that the DMZ is usually one of the most dangerous and hostile places in the world.Moon and Kim have gone for a stroll through the gardens and are now sitting privately, deep in discussion but out of earshotA plaque has been unveiled next to the tree stating: “we plant peace and prosperity,” signed by both leaders.This is significant gesture of peace in the demarcation zone, an area which is usually hostile and heavily fortified by both sidesKim has crossed back over to South Korea and met with Moon to start the tree planting ceremony.It seems they are not actually planting a tree but adding soil to a pine tree dating from 1953, the year that the Korean War armistice was signed.The soil is from both the South Korean mountain, Mt Halla, and the North Korean Mountain, Mt Baekdu- a symbolic combining of the two nationsThe optics of this morning’s summit are all extremely relaxed and even joyful between the two leaders Every course at this evening’s dinner has been diplomatically thought out to cause no offence to either side. Dishes will include a “Korean reinterpretation of the Swiss rosti”, a nod to Kim’s school years spent in Switzerland.The grilled beef on the menu will even come from the South Korean ranch which became famous in 1998 when the Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung sent 1,001 cattle from the ranch in two separate convoys across the border to the North to aid reconciliation between the rivals.The guest list is not just officials either. The wives of both Moon and Kim will be attending the meal, as well as famous cultural figures from both countries, including the North’s Hyon Song Wol, the leader of Kim’s hand-picked Moranbong girl band, and South Korean pop star Cho Yong-pil.In the meantime, here is a summary of the main events of the morning:Korean media is reporting that officials from North and South Korea are now hashing out a joint statement, which will be signed by both Kim Jong Un and President Moon.The two will resume talks at 4:30pm local time when they will plant a symbolic tree together, and then pick up discussions again before dinner at 6:30pmOther than the leaders themselves, one of the few people allowed in on this morning’s intimate meeting was Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, proving how much of a close confidante she is to him.Kim Yo Jong has already become something of a celebrity in South Korea after she attended the Winter Olympics in February, making her the first member of her family to cross the border to the South. Moon mentioned this her celebrity status his opening comments, which apparently made her blush.Kim Yo Jong was also by her brother’s side during his inaugural visit to China to meet Xi Jinping, and it is very likely she will also attend the summit with Trump next month.Here’s footage of what Kim Jong Un’s human motorcade looked like as it crossed back over the border for lunch.

But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

So why do does a degree in business deserve your precious business, and what exactly are these colleges trying to sell you?Professor Anthony Brabazon is the interim dean of the college of business at University College Dublin. We asked him to make his pitch.“I’d always advise people to study what interests you the most,” says Brabazon. “But many do know when they’re filling out that CAO form that they want to pursue a degree in business. It provides an excellent education that prepares people for a wide range of careers and is proven to be a good choice.”Brabazon, who worked as a chartered accountant with KPMG before moving into academia, says that he has seen major changes in the world of business over the past 25 years and that a degree can prepare graduates for the changes that will come. “The biggest changes I’ve seen are globalisation, an increase in the role of technology in the workplace and a transformation in how people view their career with people no longer expecting to have one job for life. These changes have big implications for the design of business education. We need to prepare students for the world they will face so that they can thrive in this environment, so business education has moved from concentrating on the technical aspects of business to a broader focus on communication, teamwork, problem-solving and leadership skills. Cultural awareness is also really important, because careers are so global these days: if you are working for an Irish firm you will be competing internationally and will also work with different people from all over the world.”Robert Mac Giolla Phadraig is chief commercial officer and founding director of Sigmar Recruitment, which recruits hundreds of business graduates every year. He has a keen insight into what employers want, so are business graduates on their wish list?“The real benefit of a business course is that it uses case studies to give a broad awareness of a business, and it also helps students to build a network of contacts,” he says. “The world of business is broad, vast and varied and won’t always neatly align what is learned in a module. But what is being assessed when a graduate enters employment is their competencies in areas such as communication, teamwork and problem-solving. The ever-important soft skills are being developed. It’s less about what is learned than how it is learned: with case studies, complex problems to be solved, guest speakers and examples which help to develop an entrepreneurial subculture among students.”It’s not all about grades and academic learning, Brabazon agrees: a business course helps students to grow into the well-rounded people that employers value. “There is a war for talent, and companies want the highest-calibre talent they can get. If you are going to have an impact in the workplace you need to be able to communicate well, work in teams, lead teams and collaborate with international colleagues. The best way to show you can have an impact is to show that you have made an impact in the past, so I advise students to go beyond their academic studies: get involved in a sports club or student society, volunteer and take on part-time work. It’s about being able to show you have made a difference in what you have done, not just getting high grades for yourself.”Increasingly, major firms are less concerned about graduates having high grades and much more interested in assessing their competencies in these key areas, with a range of psychometric tests now common for job applicants. That said, Mac Giolla Phadraig is far from dismissive of the intrinsic value of the academic content on a business course. A broad business course may contain a selection of modules across a range of areas such as sales, marketing and supply chain management as well as more formulaic classes on finance and business maths, which can help students to pivot and multitask across the full range of a company’s operations. The alumni network which students build up on a business course is really important, says Brabazon. “As you pass through a degree, you are automatically building up this contact base of your classmates, and that alumni network will mean that you know people all over the world. In our courses, we offer a mentoring programme which connects every student with a panel of experienced alumni which can really help their career progression.”When it comes down to it, what makes one business course stand out over another? “An internship or placement can be really valuable,” Mac Giolla Phadraig advises. “It’s really helpful if a graduate has an understanding of what it is like to work in a certain industry, because it helps them to focus on the right fit once they have left. The more examples of experience and relevant skills that a job applicant can bring to an interview, the better. It’s particularly valuable when an applicant can show what they have learned on the placement instead of just coasting through it. We had a management buy-out of Sigmar about nine years ago, and I learned so much of that through doing business learning does come from real experience.”No college graduate, of any discipline, can expect that graduation will be the end of their education. Continuous professional development is increasingly important and a good business course should help prepare students for a world where they need to constantly pivot, says Mac Giolla Phadraig. “I’d advise graduates to compete on merit and to show their merit through work, academia and extracurricular activity.”Would he advise students to opt for a broad, general business degree, or to hone in on a specific area like marketing or accounting? “Decisions are often driven by influencers such as peers and, in particular, parents. But if someone knows from a young age what they want to do, that is a gift, so they should go for it. For the other 95 per cent of us, it’s probably the case that a broader degree is better.” Panel: How a business course helped me: Julie Bothwell, National Used Car and Internal Fleet Manager at BMW Ireland“I decided on business and marketing because these were the subjects I really enjoyed in schools and where my strengths were. I wanted a course that would allow me to go into an area where I had lots of different opportunities, so I chose marketing at the Dublin Institute of Technology.“When choosing my degree, I researched a lot of courses, and I found it really beneficial to speak to friends and family who were already studying business or marketing this can sometimes tell you a lot more about a course than any prospectus can. “A business course gave me an academic grounding in the field I wanted to pursue. It was an intense course which was challenging at times, but this gave me great experience on how to prioritise, plan and deliver in the timeframes we were given, and these are the foundations of what you need to do in your daily job. The course covered a wide variety of subjects with a great mix of theory and more practical case study projects. We worked as a team on a projects and this is valuable experience for the workplace. I was also grateful for the level of support and interaction we had with our lecturers at DIT, and lecturers pushed us hard but were always there to guide and support us. The course taught me prioritise, plan and deliver on work.“In 2008, I joined BMW Group Ireland as a sales and marketing assistant. In that role, I supported the various different sales and marketing functions in the business. Then, in 2010, I took up the position of product manager, which involved product pricing, communication, online management, product training analysis and organisation. In 2012, I became national parts manager which required me to manage all the commercial aspects and the strategic development of the retailer network parts performance and manage the marketing and promotional campaign for parts most importantly, I ensured that customers were well looked after. From here, I took up my current position of national used car and internal fleet manager in 2015, and I’m responsible for the strategic development of our used car programme for the retailer network, retailer support and used car marketing. “I was lucky that I chose I course I loved and was able to do it well. The key is to have a consistent approach to working hard to ensure you keep on top of what you need to do. Some of the most important attributes in business are good logic and a lot of cop on. It also helped to have a strong network of friends around me on the course, because we all supported each other - and, in business, your personality and communication skills shouldn’t be underestimated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Siptu will only take part in public service negotiations if two-tier pay is endedWoman with one lung and congenital cardiac condition unable to obtain terminationVicky Phelan row: Simon Harris orders review of screening to ensure best practiceCervicalCheck director and Limerick doctor clashed over who should tell affected womenRelic stolen in 2012 and found wrapped in plastic at the Phoenix Park two weeks agoInterim document identifies \u0026lsquourgent need\u0026rsquo for remedies in primary care and fundingTeams of garda\u0026iacute raided homes of 31 suspects across 12 counties in FebruaryTalks between Government and unions on lower-pay arrangements to start on FridayThis week\u0026rsquos verbal skirmishes show main parties are squaring up for an election battleInternet Safety Advisory Committee no more than \u0026lsquoa talking shop\u0026rsquo, claims Barnardos chiefRenewal scheme will benefit up to 200 places around country, says Michael RingTrips to France made Stephanie McCorkell ineligible under \u0026lsquosix week rule\u0026rsquoMinister for Justice risks D\u0026aacuteil defeat over decision to set 13 as age of online responsibilityHow a business course can help make graduates more employableAsk yourself these questions to help you decide on the right course for youOne in every seven 2018 CAO applicants for a level 8 degree lists a business course as their first optionUSI \u0026lsquocautiously\u0026rsquo welcomes statement from Mary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor that issue is parkedFormer Anglo chief David Drumm denies defrauding investors and false accountingAnti-abortion group launches online petition calling on chairman to step down from role"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476273.1524817102!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"civil servants want equal pay scales says union ahead of talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDoreen Doggett and Peg O’Meara from Dublin at the Fórsa conference last weekend. Photograph: Domnick Walsh Eye Focus LTD The Government and public service trade unions will commence talks on Friday on the two-tier system of pay across the public service.A spokesman for Fórsa said Friday’s meeting would likely be the first of a series of engagements dealing with the practicalities of equalising the length of pay scales.The union said the term “new entrants” referred to those employed in the civil and public service since January 2011. It said their pay scales were currently two points longer than those of other staff, which meant it took them two years longer to get to the top of their pay scale.It said negotiators had to deal with the technical challenges presented by the fact that the length of pay scales varied widely across the civil and public service. Fórsa also said that in addition unions wanted to ensure that any solution was fair to all new entrants, regardless of how long they have been employed.It said no money was budgeted to deal with the issue in 2018, and the Government had not yet conceded Fórsa’s call for some money to change hands next year. Fórsa spokesman Bernard Harbor said: “This is an equity issue and, while no money has been allocated to resolve it in 2018, Fórsa believes that Ireland’s strengthening economic and exchequer recovery means it should be possible to start funding it next year, rather than delaying until 2020 or beyond. That would require funds to be allocated in October’s Budget.“Pay equity is a priority for all trade unions, and every bit of progress in addressing this injustice has been achieved by unions collectively, through national pay negotiations and public service pay agreements.”The country’s largest trade union Siptu said it will not be party to a new public service agreement unless the Government moves to end the two-tier arrangement which sees those appointed after 2011 paid less than more longer-serving colleagues.The Government had previously stated that while a review of this arrangement could take place, there would be no funding to end the two-tier system before the end of 2020 when the current public service pay deal expires.However, it now seems likely that the Government is prepared to accelerate the ending of this pay system although when and how this will take place remains to be finalised."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475675.1524766183!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fg ff ramp up the insults it s all about the election stupid","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPut ’em up: Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Fine Gael TDs want to go to the polls at a time of their own choosing, not Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin’s. Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReuters“We have to expose them for what they are,” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told his parliamentary party, in the course of a barrage of criticism of Fianna Fáil on Wednesday night.Fianna Fáil, he told his TDs, would “bankrupt the country, as they have done in the past”.Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath (not the leader, noticeably) issued a spirited response, which he repeated on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland: it was “political mudslinging”. He trumpeted Fianna Fáil’s record on supporting the budgets and pointing out – not unfairly – that it was Fine Gael who made the biggest promise of the last election: to abolish the Universal Social Charge.As ever, senior political figures in both parties were more frank,\u0026nbspspeaking privately. The barbs were sharper, profane and more personalised.That’s not unusual. But the exchanges this week are part of a trend of hostility between the two parties that has been growing in recent months.In the Dáil earlier that day, Varadkar accused his partners in the confidence and supply agreement of dishonesty: “when people go around the country promising every interest group they will do everything they ask this year . . . As is always the case, the truth hurts. That is what Deputy Micheál Martin’s party is doing and I am keeping a record of all the promises his spokespersons are making as the weeks go by. Hundreds of millions in extra spending are being promised every week for every interest group and it is all being promised now. That is exactly the kind of philosophy that landed this country in the hole out of which we had to take it a number of years ago.”His backbenchers stiffened with excitement – they love this stuff – while the Fianna Fáilers slouched sourly.“They believe Fianna Fáil’s job is to shut up and let them do whatever they want,” said one senior figure. The rest of his observation was colourful, indicating an unwillingness to follow this course of action.Varadkar does not do this kind of thing by accident. And Fine Gael sources close to the thinking of the leadership say that this marks a deliberate departure: the party wants to get back talking about the economy, and get back to attacking Fianna Fáil’s record on it.So Fine Gael has produced a dossier of Fianna Fáil promises, and is stacking up the numbers to throw back at them. Some of the Fine Gael numbers are speculative, to say the least, but they have a point about Fianna Fáil showing plenty of leg to interest groups of late. That tends to be what opposition parties do, of course.But there’s another dynamic at play here too: the deterioration in relations between the two parties, and their leaders, has been evident for some time.In a way, this is not surprising. Varadkar was elected leader by his party partly on the promise to stand up to Fianna Fáil, which many Fine Gaelers inside and outside Government felt was pushing Enda Kenny around.Since then, relations have soured considerably. Enda Kenny and Micheál Martin did not click on a personal level, but they had shared experiences, shared understandings and established a passable modus operandi between them. Varadkar and Martin, by contrast, are from different planets.Martin has had the better of their face-offs so far. Varadkar backed down on Frances Fitzgerald, and again on the Strategic Communications Unit. But he is a quick student, and better at ruffling Fianna Fáil’s feathers than he sometimes realises.Fianna Fáil TDs like to think they have his measure but they’re not sure. The rivals circle each other warily and suspiciously.Underpinning all this is the common realisation that the confidence and supply arrangement between the two parties is coming to its end. There is at present zero appetite in Fianna Fáil for it to be renewed, and little expectation in Fine Gael that it will be. If that stays the same – and there’s little sign that it won’t – then we are in the ante-room to a general election.So the question becomes about timing. Fine Gael is acutely aware it got the timing of the last election wrong, and is very, very keen not to make that mistake again. Within Government circles, there is a dread of concluding the budget, and then finding themselves at Fianna Fáil’s mercy.Varadkar’s people are keen to go at a time of their choosing, not of Micheál Martin’s.Stephen Collins’s column in Thursday’s , arguing that Varadkar should go to the country after the abortion referendum, caused a wobble of excitement in Leinster House. In truth, few people in either of the big parties expect a pre-summer election. But they expect one pretty soon after that.That is what is at the root of the skirmishing of recent days. It also suggests it will not let up until voters go to the polls.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.

Photograph: EPAKim Jong-un has become the first North Korean leader to enter South Korea, stepping across the military line iding the peninsula to warmly shake hands with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, before the two walked briefly back across the border in a surprise move.Wearing his signature Mao Zedong-style suit, Mr Kim appeared bemused by the large number of photographers on the southern side but his debut in South Korea was brisk and confident.“I am happy to meet you,” Mr Kim said shortly before sitting down with Mr Moon for talks, which are expected to deal with denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, as well as economic issues.The exchange between the two leaders appeared warm and they held hands as they crossed the military demarcation line.“I say this before president Moon and many journalists here that I will hold good discussions with president Moon with a frank, sincere and honest attitude and make a good outcome,” said Mr Kim, who is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea.The two men were then escorted by an honour guard clad in brightly coloured traditional costumes to the meeting venue.Mr Kim inscribed the visitors’ book with the message: “New history starts now age of peace, from the starting point of history.”Later, as they sat at a table for the start of the summit, Mr Kim said he wondered why it had taken so long for talks to take place. He also said he had brought naengmyeon, a Pyongyang cold noodle dish, for them to enjoy at dinner.The meeting took place at Panmunjom, which is 50 kilometres north of Seoul, and is home to a peace centre as well as a military barracks.The truce ending the Korean War was signed here in 1953, although the two countries remain technically at war as no formal peace treaty was ever signed.“The moment chairman Kim crosses the military demarcation line, Panmunjom became a symbol of peace, not a symbol of ision,” Mr Moon said, referring to Mr Kim by his official title as chairman of North Korea’s state affairs commission.“I wish to again express my respect to chairman Kim Jong-un’s decision that made today’s discussions possible,” Mr Moon said.The meeting is the third inter-Korean summit, following two previous meetings in 2000 and 2007, and it is the first to take place in South Korea. It comes after months of easing tensions between the two Koreas and is expected to lay the groundwork for a meeting with US president Donald Trump in May or June."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475713.1524770096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"conservatives can hide from customs union debate but can they run","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Brexiteer Kate Hoey: “I feel a little alone today,” she said to a nearly deserted House, as MPs stayed away from a debate on the customs union. Photograph: Andy RainEPAIt is acknowledged on all sides as the crunch question surrounding Brexit right now, but when MPs held a debate about the customs union on Thursday, most of them didn’t show up. The government benches were almost deserted, with empty rows of green leather where the loudest Conservative Brexiteers usually sit, and junior treasury minister Mel Stride manning the front bench.None of the DUP’s 10 MPs were present, leaving North Down’s Sylvia Hermon to represent Northern Ireland – and unionism – alone. Antrim-born Kate Hoey, a Labour Brexiteer, referred to her absent friends as she spoke in favour of leaving the customs union.“I feel a little alone today,” she said.Instead of risking defeat on a non-binding motion, government whips told their MPs to abstain on the vote and to feel free to take the afternoon off. It’s a technique they have used a number of times in response to opposition motions since Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority last year, and it annoys the Speaker but saves the government’s blushes.On its own, Thursday’s vote changed nothing, but the debate will have alarmed the whips as they watched hitherto shy Tory rebels speak up in favour of the customs union. Ten Conservatives have already put their names to a pro-customs union amendment to a Bill next month, and Thursday’s debate suggested that more could join them – possibly enough to ensure the government’s defeat.May reassured Eurosceptic backbenchers this week that she remains committed to leaving the customs union, a red line she laid down in her first Conservative conference speech as leader in October 2016. She repeated the pledge in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017 and it has survived each major iteration of her government’s Brexit policy. The backbenchers said they were reassured by the prime minister’s latest renewal of the vow, and Jacob Rees-Mogg said this week that it would be political suicide for a Conservative government to agree to remain in a customs union.\u0026nbspMay’s problem is that she has promised to keep trade as frictionless as possible, partly because of the impact on British industry of any friction in the EU-wide supply chains used by big manufacturers. She has also promised to avoid a hard border in Ireland and ruled out any new trade barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.The EU has rejected both of May’s customs proposals, and many in her own government are contemptuous of the option she is believed to favour – a customs partnership that would mean Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU on imports destined for the European market.The second option, a customs arrangement now known as maximum facilitation or “maxfac”, would use technology and trusted trader schemes to make customs controls less intrusive and time-consuming.Brexiteers are suspicious of the customs partnership, which they fear could be adapted into a customs union in all but name. Under one scenario, Britain could agree to adopt a common external tariff with the EU for manufactured goods only. Services, which account for 80 per cent of the British economy, are not covered by the customs union, but new potential trade partners would probably want access to the British market for their agricultural exports.The island of Ireland is already treated as a single territory for phytosanitary standards, and passengers flying into Belfast from London often remark on agricultural hygiene notices at the airport. The DUP insists that Northern Ireland must not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in matters of trade after Brexit.But could they be persuaded to accept an arrangement that is close to the status quo on agriculture? And if not, how plausible is their threat to topple the Conservative government?Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, it is difficult to trigger a general election if the government doesn’t want one – and it is safe to assume that May is in no rush to reacquaint herself with the electorate. If May loses a confidence vote in Parliament, Jeremy Corbyn would have a chance to try to form a government before an election is called.Next week’s local elections could be almost as important as events in Parliament in determining the behaviour of Conservative MPs over Brexit. If Labour has its biggest victory in London for almost half a century, as polls predict, Conservative backbenchers may find unpalatable compromises on Brexit a little easier to swallow.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475764.1524772585!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former tory ministers back uk staying in eu customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative support for remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit indicates the strength of a growing rebellion on prime minister Theresa May’s backbenches. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesA number of former Conservative ministers have voiced support for remaining in a customs union with the European Union after Brexit during a parliamentary debate that showed the strength of a growing rebellion on Theresa May’s backbenches.Conservatives abstained on the non-binding motion in favour of customs union membership but pro-European Tories joined opposition MPs to speak in favour of it.Former attorney general Dominic Grieve accused the government of adopting a blundering approach to Brexit which ignored the reality that new trade deals outside the EU could not compensate for the loss of single-market and customs-union membership.“Why is it that the deputy ambassador of Japan has us all in and says: ‘You do realise that every Japanese company will be gone in 10 years’ time if they cannot have frictionless trade into the European Union?’ We are behaving in the most extraordinary and blinded fashion as we blunder around ignoring the realities. And, in any case, free-trade agreements come with strings attached,” he said.“If you have a free-trade agreement, if you have multiple free-trade agreements, they will very quickly start to look like customs unions. That’s what happens when people get together. So this ‘customs union bad, somehow free-trade agreement good’ simply does not stack up. It is time for a reality check. In fact, we need more than a customs union because, as is also clearly obvious, we are not going to be able to trade without regulatory alignment.”George Freeman, Ms May’s former policy chief, said many of his constituents who voted Leave said they were happy with the single market but objected to a political union. Luke Graham, a Conservative MP who won his seat in Ochil and South Perthshire last year, rejected the accusation that remaining in a customs union was a betrayal of the Brexit vote.“None of our constituents voted to be poorer. None of our constituents wanted to have more barriers between ourselves and our international trading partners. We don’t mind the labels, we don’t mind the mechanism, but I know from my constituents they want to be able to have a customs system that they can rely on, that respects the United Kingdom’s integrity, but also allows them to prosper and be better off than they are today,” he said.Conservative Brexiteer Hugo Swire said remaining in the customs union made no sense at a time when the EU’s share of global trade was shrinking. He said leaving it was a necessary step to restoring Britain’s global trading role.“The government have set out to ensure that we are a truly global Britain. As we have heard, remaining inside a customs union with the EU would prevent the UK from committing to that agenda and striking lucrative free-trade agreements with countries across the world,” he said.Veteran pro-European Conservative Ken Clarke poured scorn on the idea that lucrative new trade deals awaited Britain once it leaves the EU.“The idea that some marvellous new global future with fantastic new trade deals is about to open up is hopeless. If someone can get the Americans to open up their public procurement to international competition and give up the ‘Buy America’ policy or to open the regulatory barriers that they have put in the way of professional and financial services, they will be a miraculous negotiator, because we could get nowhere when Obama was in power. I do not think that the present administration are offering us anything they just want their beef to come here,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475759.1524772343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may under mounting pressure to keep britain in customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s home secretary Amber Rudd  in the House of Commons  in London on Thursday. Photograph: Getty ImagesTheresa May was under mounting pressure last night to keep Britain in a customs union with the European Union after Conservative rebels joined opposition MPs to call for a change in her government’s policy. MPs backed a non-binding motion in favour of a customs union, with Conservatives abstaining to avoid a vote.Ten Conservatives have already signed a binding amendment to a trade Bill next month that would oblige Britain to remain in a customs union. Other Conservatives spoke in favour of last night’s motion, suggesting that the rebels could defeat the government next month.The prime minister this week restated her determination to leave the customs union and the single market when Britain leaves the EU. But MPs warned that her pledge was incompatible with promises to keep trade frictionless and avoid the return of a hard border.Labour’s Yvette Cooper warned that any new infrastructure on the Border, including cameras, represented a potential threat to peace in Northern Ireland.“The concern relates to what happens around the Border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and the introduction of new infrastructure at that Border, especially such symbolic infrastructure, and especially anything that would increase the sense of there being targets for dissident organisations. We do not want them to become more active and have more to focus on,” she said.Antrim-born Kate Hoey, one of a small number of Labour MPs who backed Brexit, said that nobody was talking about a return to large, intrusive border structures but the issue of the Border was being used in an attempt to thwart Brexit. She criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and said the Government ought to be helping Britain to achieve a good deal that would also benefit Ireland.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Varadkar and the Irish Government should get in there and use their position to get the European Union to see some common sense. Such a small proportion of total European Union trade relates to the Republic of Ireland, yet the Irish Government have got into a position where it is their country that the European Union is listening to,” she said.Earlier, Downing Street issued a sharp correction after home secretary Amber Rudd appeared to cast doubt on the government’s determination to leave the customs union. Answering questions from journalists at Westminster, Ms Rudd said she would “not be drawn” on whether Britain could still be in a customs union after Brexit.“We still have a few discussions to be had in a really positive, consensual and easy way among some of my cabinet colleagues in order to arrive at a final position,” she said.After Downing Street insisted that the government’s position had not changed, Ms Rudd tweeted her own clarification:\u0026nbsp“Of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.”The House of Lords last week backed an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill calling on the government to explore the option of remaining in a customs union with the EU.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal.

She said that her child had been disturbed by the publication of the photograph, which she considered to be private.The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. The photograph had been taken ten years ago, so it did not consider that the child, who was not named in the article, would be easily recognisable from the image. It also noted that the image was publicly available on the complainant’s public Facebook page. The newspaper said that in any case, there was also a public interest in publishing the photograph as it helped to bring home to readers the gravity of the situation in which children had been involved.The article clearly reported on a subject which involved the child’s welfare: she had been involved in a shooting and had witnessed her mother being shot and seriously injured. The un-pixilated photograph of the child showed her full face.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in urged “bold” decisions that would be a “great gift” to humanity.When they broke for lunch a few hours later, the South said the two leaders had so far discussed \u0026quotdenuclearisation and a permanent peace\u0026quot - but there were no further details.They re-emerged having eaten in their own countries for a ceremonial tree planting ceremony, which was laden with symbolism. Kim and Moon planted a pine tree - standing for peace and prosperity - on the Military Demarcation Line, an area synonymous with confrontation and ision over the past 65 years.The pine is a transplanted specimen said to have been seeded in 1953 - the year the Korean War ended - and soil and water from the North and South were used to bed it in.Their historic meeting began at 9.30am local time as Kim emerged from the Panmungak, the North\u0027s symbolic building 80m north of border, with a large entourage including his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, sweeping down the wide staircase to make his way to the Military Demarcation Line that separates the two countries, where President Moon Jae-in waited to greet him.Kim Jong-un holds historic summit with South Korean president - in picturesWith wide grins, the two men shook hands as they met for the first time, and Kim became the first North Korean leader to cross over to the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone since the Korean War ended in 1953 .“You have come to the South, when will I be able to come to the North?” asked Mr Moon.“Maybe now is the right time for you to enter North Korean territory?” quipped Kim, and in an unscripted move, the two men held hands as the stepped back over the ide into the North.The images, broadcast live around the world, were highly emotional for the ided Korean peninsula, which never formally ended the Korean War of 1950-53. In a vast press room a few miles from the location of the talks in Panmunjom, South Korean journalists gasped and applauded.The meeting of the two leaders was only the third in the history of the two nations, and it has raised hopes of finding an eventual solution to international tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missiles programmes.In a guestbook at the Peace House summit venue, Kim wrote: \u0026quotA new history begins now - at the starting point of history and the era of peace.\u0026quot The reclusive Kim, 34, appeared nervous at first as he met Mr Moon and accompanied him along a red carpet to inspect an honour guard.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in walk across the military demarcation lineBut he later relaxed, quipping that he hoped Mr Moon would enjoy the cold noodles speciality he had brought from the North and promising that he would no longer interrupt the South Korean president’s sleep with early morning missile tests.Kim was \u0026quotflooded with emotion\u0026quot, he told Mr Moon as their talks began in a grand meeting room in the Peace House in the village of Panmunjom on the southern size of the demilitarised border zone.\u0026quotI feel like I\u0027m firing a flare at the starting line in the moment of (the two Koreas) writing a new history in North-South relations, peace and prosperity,\u0026quot Kim told Moon as they sat at a table, which had been built so that exactly 2018 millimeters separated them, to begin their closed-door talks. He urged “candid” and “future-orientated” talks.“I’m so filled with excitement because of the meeting at this historic site. And I was truly moved that you have come all the way to receive me at the Military Demarcation Line,” he told President Moon.Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s message in the guest book: \u0026#39A new history begins now - at the starting point of history and the era of peace\u0026#39Mr Moon responded that “It was your bold and courageous decision that has allowed us to come this far.”After two hours of private talks, Kim’s security convoy left to take a lunchbreak in the North, with twelve guards jogging alongside his black Mercedes limousine.A spokesman from Seoul’s presidential office briefed reporters that their interactions had been amiable, with Kim expressing his admiration for the South’s high speed rail, and Mr Moon making Kim Yo-jong “blush” when he said she was now a celebrity.\u0026quotThe two leaders had a sincere and frank dialogue over the denuclearisation and the establishment of permanent peace of the Korean peninsula and development of inter-Korea ties,\u0026quot Yoon Young-chan, a spokesman added.South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attend the inter-Korean summit at the truce village of PanmunjomThe meeting was also replete with grandiose statements of intent. “We should value this opportunity so that the scars between the South and North could be healed,” Kim was quoted as saying. “The border line isn’t that high it will eventually be erased if a lot of people pass over it.”But as the talks prepare to resume, little has been revealed of actual progress towards resolving one of the world’s most pressing security threats.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is welcoming the summit between the two Koreas but says he does not expect any great breakthrough that might curb North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions.Mr Johnson told reporters at Nato headquarters: \u0026quotI am very encouraged by what\u0027s happening.\u0026quotBut he added: \u0026quotI don\u0027t think that anybody looking at the history of North Korea\u0027s plans to develop a nuclear weapon would want to be over-optimistic at this point. But it is clearly good news that the two leaders are meeting. Absolutely.\u0026quotChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying hailed the “courage” of Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-In, as the two leaders continued talks this afternoon, Jamie Fullerton reports from Beijing.\u0026quotWe applaud the Korean leaders\u0027 historic step and appreciate their political decisions and courage,” Hua said during a regular press briefing.China, North Korea’s only political ally, borders the isolated country so is particularly keen for peace on the Korean peninsular. Kim visited Beijing last month for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping: the first time the North Korean leader had met a head of state in person.Earlier today Chinese state media called for the leaders to keep talks on track, saying: “As a main stakeholder, China has been dedicated to the development of peace on the Korean Peninsula and proposed a ‘dual-track’ approach – advancing denuclearisation and meanwhile establishing a peace regime, to relevant parties.In a summit already overloaded with symbolism, Kim Jong-un and President Moon Jae-in opted for a time-old favourite ahead of a second round of talks by jointly “planting” a tree, or at least throwing fresh soil at the roots of an existing pine, and freshening it with some water.Kim kept Mr Moon waiting for a few minutes before dashing to the spot in his black Merc, this time causing his 12-strong security team to speed up from a relaxed jog to a mini-sprint.Donning white gloves, the two leaders shoveled soil from South Korea’s Mount Halla and the North’s Mount Baekdu onto the base of a beautifully scuplted dome-shaped tree, before using green watering cans to freshen the ground with water from the South’s Han river and the North’s Taedong.Leaving their aides behind, they strolled alone towards a nearby, 50m blue wooden footbridge, before sitting down to chat on a bench with a woodland backdrop. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attend tree planting ceremony during the inter-Korean summit at the truce village of PanmunjomThe ceremonial planting on the Military Demarcation Line laden with symbolism, with the pine tree standing for peace and prosperity in an area synonymous with confrontation and ision over the past 65 years.The pine is a transplanted specimen said to have been seeded in 1953 - the year the Korean War ended. After the tree planting is concluded, the second round of talks will continue.There has been a lot of emphasis on the unscripted moment Kim took Mr Moon\u0027s hand and led him across the border to North Korea. The highly symbolic - and unplanned - moment is likely to have raised the blood pressure of security on both sides. But it made for this memorable picture.The summit will not officially resume until 4.30pm (8.30am  GMT), a South Korean presidential spokesman has announced. It will begin with the ceremonial planting of a pine tree using soil and water from both countries, to symbolise \u0026quotpeace and prosperity”, and the two leaders will then walk across a footbridge over the official border line.The next round of talks will be concluded with the signing of a joint declaration, the content of which is still being thrashed out.At 6.30pm (10.30am GMT), a lavish banquet attended by Kim and his wife Ri Sol-ju and Mr Moon and his wife Kim Jung-sook will be preceded by a musical extravaganza featuring stringed instruments and songs from both North and South.The songs will include a rendition of From Seoul to Pyongyang, about the reunification of the peninsula.After the first round of talks, Mr Moon\u0027s spokesman has revealed that the two leaders have discussed denuclearisation and a permanent peace on the Korean peninsula.\u0026quotThe two leaders had a sincere and frank dialogue over the denuclearisation and the establishment of permanent peace of the Korean peninsula and development of inter-Korea ties,\u0026quot said Yoon Young-chan.The leaders are expected to continue negotiations after their break for lunch on their respective sides of the border, before they dine together at a banquet on the southern side later this evening.Mr Yoon has also confirmed that Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will come to Panmunjom at 6.15pm for the official banquet.We have more on the rise Ms Ri, from cheerleader to North Korea\u0027s \u0027first lady\u0027 hereSouth Korean conservative activists have set fire to North Korean flags during a rally against the summit talks between the leaders of the two Koreas, AP reports.Hundreds of activists gathered near the border village of Panmunjom to protest against the talks between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.They set on fire two paper North Korean flags with the images of Kim and his late father and grandfather.They also chanted slogans including \u0026quotStep down, Moon Jae-in!\u0026quotA conservative activist prepares to display partially burnt images of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung (L), Kim Jong Il The decision to greet Kim Jong-un with an honour guard after he stepped across the border into South Korea has been condemned by conservatives, who have described it as a “humiliation” to service personnel who are protecting the nation. The honour guard was made up of representatives of the three branches of the military, army, navy and air force. Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, is a former member of the special forces and saluted as he inspected the guard. Mr Kim, however, looked straight ahead as he walked along the red carpet. North Korea\u0026#39s leader Kim Jong-un (L) walks with South Korea\u0026#39s President Moon Jae-in (R) past a guard of honourConservatives began a petition on the website of the Blue House against the decision even before Mr Kim crossed the border, quickly attracting more than 1,000 signatures. “The event will not enhance the morale of South Korean soldiers”, one signatory said in a comment, according to The Korea Times. \u0026quotThe decision is a humiliation to 600,000 South Korean soldiers who serve their military duty to protect the South from possible attack by the regime”.\u0026quotIt is absurd for the South Korean military to hold an honour guard for a third-generation dictator of the regime at a time when soldiers from the South carry out military operations to fight against North Korea\u0026quot, the poster added.Kim Jong-un and President Moon mixed small talk with grand statements about working together to make the world a better place in their introductory remarks, according to Yoon Young-chan, senior secretary of communication in the South’s presidential office.Mr Yoon confirmed that Mr Moon’s decision to step north of the border, while holding hands with Kim, had been entirely unplanned, and offered a read-out of their comments to each other, writes Nicola Smith.“You have come to the South, when I will be able to come to the North?” Mr Moon asked as he first shook hands with Kim across the ten centimetre high concrete block marking the Military Demarcation Line along the border.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un suggests Mr Moon crosses into the North“Maybe now is the right time for you to enter North Korean territory?” quipped Kim, and Mr Moon stepped across.As they watched a short performance by a military guard, Kim added that he would like to see the full version, and would be “willing to go to the Blue House any time”, referring to the presidential palace in Seoul.The two leaders then took part in a spontaneous photo-op with their entire delegations before heading into the Peace House to talk about specially chosen paintings of South and North Korean scenery that depicted communication between both sides.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, left, shanks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the Peace House at the border village of Panmunjom Kim thanked Mr Moon for the detailed thought that had been put into greeting him.The two leaders indulged in small talk about their journeys to the border, and Kim appeared to be relaxed after initially looking nervous as he cross the border on live TV.He teased Mr Moon about his sleeping habits, saying he had heard that he had a habit of waking up early. “I will make sure that I won’t wake you up early,” he said, in a light-hearted reference to his notoriously early missile tests of the past.Taking a more serious tone, he commented on the suitability of their meeting place, which had been a “place of conflict”, adding that he hoped they could “heal the pain” of ision. Improvements would come “if we hold our hands together and deal with things together,” he told Mr Moon.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, second from right, talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in“Let’s meet often and determine ourselves to never go back to the start. Let’s create a better world for everyone,” said Kim. “We come here to put an end to confrontation. We are here together to come up with a good solution.”The South Korean president expressed his hope that his government could keep up with the pace of diplomacy, and also his wish to see the North’s Mount Paektu some day.He offered his condolences about the train crash that killed dozens of Chinese tourists earlier this week, and also made Kim’s younger sister blush by telling her she was now a celebrity in the South.The Guard Command, the military unit tasked with ensuring the safety of the leadership, is an elite institution close to the centre of North Korean power - it provides the centrepiece display of the annual kimjongilia and kimilsungia flower festivals in Pyongyang to honour Kim\u0027s father and grandfather.Ri Yong-guk, a defector from the North who served on a security detail for Kim Jong-il, wrote in a 2013 memoir that as many as six different layers of security guards protected the leader on trips to the countryside to inspect military units, plants or farms.\u0026quotIt is one of the world\u0027s tightest security blankets through which even a single ant would find it hard to go,\u0026quot he wrote.That\u0027s the morning session of talks over. Kim Jong-un is heading back across the border for lunch before returning for a second round of talks in the afternoon.A North Korean woman who claims to have “mistakenly” defected to South Korea in 2011 says she hopes the summit between the two nations’ leaders may enable her to return to Pyongyang before the end of the year, writes Julian Ryall.  “I was so nervous counting the days to the summit,” Kim Ryon-hui said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I believe I will be able to go back to Pyongyang within this year, maybe in June. “Is my anticipation too high?” she asked. Ms Kim was a dressmaker in North Korea and has claimed that she was talked into travelling to South Korea by a Chinese smuggler who said she would be able to make a large amount of money in a short period of time and then return to the North. Under South Korean law, however, it is illegal for citizens to travel to the North and Ms Kim’s requests to be repatriated have all been refused. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has given his younger sister a place at the negotiating table for the first North-South Korea summit in more than a decade.Kim Yo-jong has emerged as the most visible member of the regime after her brother - since she became the first member of the ruling North Korean family to travel to the South in early February for the Olympics.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, left, walks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his sister Kim Yo-jong She was in Kim\u0027s delegation as he walked across the line that ides the two Koreas on Friday morning and took a seat beside him as he started his first round of talks with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.The only other North Korean official present was former intelligence chief Kim Yong-chol, the top official in charge of relations with the South.Read more about Kim\u0027s sister  If you\u0027re wondering whether North Koreans are glued to their screens watching these historic developments unfold ... they\u0027re not. South Korean President Moon Jae-in told Kim Jong-un that he hoped to see a \u0026quotbold agreement\u0026quot as they began their summit on Friday.\u0026quotI hope we engage in frank talks and reach a bold agreement so that we may give a big gift to the whole Korean people and the people who want peace,\u0026quot Moon said.Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in’s opening comments have been broadcast live from the meeting room at the Peace House where they will conduct talks, writes Nicola Smith.Kim spoke first, on the optimistic note that “this is a starting point for us, I believe we’ll make a new beginning.” He urged “candid talks for good results” that would be “future-orientated”, adding, “I hope we don’t go back to square one.”He also expressed hope that President Moon would enjoy the cold Pyongyang noodles that would be served at this evening’s banquet.South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attend the inter-Korean summit at the truce village of PanmunjomPresident Moon replied that he felt “really good” about the day ahead but noted that “we have a huge burden on our shoulders” and “huge expectations” ahead.He praised Kim for his “courageous and bold decision” to come to the talks. “Why don’t we make bold and courageous decisions to amicably talk about peace,” he said.Kim Jong-un has kicked off the talks expressing hope of some agreements.  On a lighter note, he also joked about how far the cold noodles have had to come today. As talks get under way, here\u0027s the scene inside the room. Sat to the left of Kim Jong-un is his sister, Kim Yo-jong.The United States is hopeful the talks between the two Korean leaders will make progress on achieving peace and prosperity.In a statement, the White House said it looked forward to continuing discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim in the coming weeks.On the occasion of Republic of Korea President Moon Jae-in’s historic meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, we wish the Korean people well. We are hopeful that talks will achieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula.  The United States appreciates the close coordination with our ally, the Republic of Korea, and looks forward to continuing robust discussions in preparation for the planned meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.Kim Jong-un has signed the guestbook with a message of peace, saying a \u0026quotnew history begins now ....the age of peace\u0026quot.North Korean watchers have been pouring over the images emerging, scrutinising every detail. Kim\u0027s sister Kim Yo-jong stayed away from the spotlight, but stayed in the background.She also handed the pen to Kim to sign the guestbook. Some speculated that Kim Jong-un appeared nervous. The two leaders also posed for photos beside a painting of the Bukhansan mountain in Seoul.Abraham M Denmark, director of the Asia programme at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in DC, says  the summit could produce \u0026quotan ambitious and very positive outcome\u0026quot.After much pomp and fanfare, the two leaders appear to have gone into the room for talks.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a welcome ceremony at the inter-Korean summit at the truce village of PanmunjomThe two leaders take part in the red carpet ceremony at the DMZThere has already one moment that was unplanned.

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system.

That is what Diana did with victims of Aids and landmines and very effective she was too,” the former politician continued. “Rights are the business of politicians and pressure groups and never more so than when they are controversial.”“Second, what a week for any royal to join in the argument when the Commonwealth conference was in full swing, the position of Prince Charles as its future head was in delicate negotiation and some of its bishops were voicing concern about their countries being pressurised by Theresa May on the issue of LGBT rights. So nought out of 10 for both phraseology and timing.”Widdecombe’s column comes after she branded Ms Markle “trouble” back in January – saying the actor’s background and attitude made her “uneasy”.Ms Widdecombe made the remarks in the Celebrity Big Brother house, which were broadcast after Ms Markle and Harry wowed crowds on a trip to Brixton.The former prisons minister, who has been a controversial figure for many years, made the remarks to fellow housemate Rachel Johnson and others, while having make-up applied by Made In Chelsea star Ashley James.Ms Widdecombe said: “I think she’s trouble.

During her political career, she did not once vote in favour of gay rights – opposing significant acts of legislation like civil partnerships, repealing Section 28, the Equality Act, reducing the age of consent for homosexual sex, and gay couples adopting.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is why so many are demanding a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal.”The campaign has launched a crowd funding appeal to raise £100,000 to meet the costs of organising and advertising for the march.Ms May has firmly rejected a further referendum, but some pro-EU Tories believe she could yet accept one if it appears the only way to keep her warring party together on Europe.Similarly, although Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour does not back another referendum, he has left the door open to a change of mind.Rudd says government still has no \u0027final position\u0027 on customs unionNo 10 warned about Brexit border plan by head of NI civil serviceIrish border Brexit solution needed by June, Guy Verhofstadt saysBrexit agreement \u0027likely to be rejected\u0027 by MPs without trade dealThere is also polling evidence that public support is growing for a referendum on the Brexit deal, amid continuing confusion about both the planned transition period and the final trade deal with the EU.Opinion appears to be shifting as the negotiations remain bogged down on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland and with the details of a trade deal unlikely to even be discussed until after departure day.Some Tory MPs also believe a legal challenge – to require a further referendum before Brexit can go ahead – could yet put the government in difficulty.The case will argue that the 2011 “referendum lock” introduced by David Cameron – preventing any significant change to relations with the EU without the public’s say – applies to the Brexit talks.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the first resident, Korean man Choi Jong-duk moved there in 1965, several more people have since become resident on the islands. According to a Korean website dedicated to the islands, as of 2017 there were two civilian residents, two government officials, six lighthouse managers, and 40 members of the coast guard.

The Olympics plan was hatched during an earlier meeting between North and South Korean diplomats, which went smoothly but skirted around the issue of nuclear weapons. This time around, North Korea\u0027s state news agency said Mr Kim would open-heartedly discuss all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula with Mr Moon.Mr Kim has also made plans to meet with Mr Trump, in what would be the first in-person meeting between a US and North Korean president in history. The North Korean leader has already met with Mike Pompeo, the director of the CIA, in preparation for the summit.The White House issued a statement on the inter-Korean summit on Thursday, saying the US was hopeful about the talks, and looked forward to the meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Trump. North Korea \u0027suspends\u0027 missile and nuclear testsBoth the US and South Korea would like to see the denuclearisation of the North, which is close to building a nuclear missile capable that can reach the US. Mr Kim has said he is open to discussing the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula with both leaders, but experts say he will likely require tough concessions from the Americans.  Among other things, Mr Kim has taken issue with the US soldiers stationed in South Korea, the joint military exercises the two countries perform, and the lack of a formal peace treaty to end the Korea War. He also wants the US to remove its nuclear umbrella over the Penninsula and the Northeast Asian region.The Korea peace talks wouldn\u0027t be happening without TrumpThe US\u0027s relationship with Iran remains as strained as everSouth Korea and the US have slightly different ideas about how to denuclearise the North, with Mr Moon favouring a step-by-step process and Mr Trump calling for the immediate destruction of the country\u0027s nuclear weapons.Mr Moon is likely setting the stage to serve as a mediator between the US and the North in this week\u0027s meeting, having acknowledged that any long-term solution on the Peninsula will require American input.“Peace on the Korean Peninsula cannot be achieved by agreements between South and North Korea alone,” he said last month. “It has to have American endorsement.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

People will then rightly ask in what way we have left the EU. This debate is simply an attempt to frustrate Brexit and undermine the referendum result.\u0026ldquoIf we do not leave the Customs Union, there is no point in leaving the EU.

London tube strike 2018: When is the tube strike? Which lines?                France travel news: SNCF and Air France staff strike TODAYThis system, which lets the driver open and shut the doors from his cab and downgrades the role of guards, has led to two years of strikes on Southern, with the dispute spreading to franchises across the country.The committee said the DfT had expected the DOO plan to cause disruption for passengers - but did not bother discussing the plans with the rail unions.The PAC was also highly critical of the running of the ECML where franchises have already failed in 2006 and 2009.Earlier this year Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told MPs that the franchise holder, Virgin Trains East Coast, would only be able to continue in its current form for a \u0026ldquovery small number of months.Driver Only Operation has led to two years of strikesThe PAC said the DfT \u0026ldquohas failed to learn the lessons from previous failures of the franchise, and has again allowed the operator to promise more than it could deliver.It added: \u0026ldquoThe issues we have found with the East Coast and TSGN, and the small pool of potential bidders in the market, highlight the broken model of franchising.PAC chairman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said: \u0026ldquoThe operation of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise has been a multi-faceted shambles causing untold misery for passengers.\u0026ldquoMeanwhile, the East Coast franchise has failed for a third time because of wildly inaccurate passenger growth forecasts.\u0026ldquoIn both cases the Government appears to have seen its task as simply to contract out the service, with wholly inadequate consideration given to passengers\u0026rsquo best interests and behaviour.\u0026ldquoThis imbalance cannot continue. The franchising model is broken and passengers are paying the price.\u0026ldquoIf taxpayers are to have any faith in Government\u0026rsquos ability to deliver an effective passenger rail network then it must conduct and act on a thorough review before any further franchises are awarded.She warned that new timetables are due to be launched on GTR routes next month amid widespread fears of more disruption.The RMT rail union, which wants the industry renationalised and is behind the DOO disputes, called for Mr Grayling\u0026rsquos resignation.Hundreds of thousands of commuters stood in the cold and rain queuing for over-stuffed buses as they battled to get to work as the RMT forced closure of the entire Tube network.1 of 16General Secretary Mick Cash said: \u0026ldquoWhen the cross party Public Accounts Committee says the franchising model is broken and that this government is to blame for both the Southern and East Coast fiascos, that have cost the economy and tax payer billions, Chris Grayling has no option other than to resign.\u0026ldquoHe is a specialist in failure of the highest order and is not fit to run a whelk stall let alone our railways.\u0026ldquoThe MPs also rightly blame the government for the prolonged industrial action on Southern Rail and RMT is repeating the call for an urgent summit to resolve the current disputes over guards and safety.Andy McDonald MP, Labour\u0026rsquos Shadow Transport Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoThe committee\u0026rsquos findings confirm what Labour has been saying for years.The Rail Delivery Group has pledged to work with the Government to improve the system\u0026ldquoThe rail franchising model is on life support and is being ideologically propped up by a Tory government which has run out of ideas.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time Chris Grayling pulled the plug on this discredited and disintegrating system. It is now clear that public ownership is the only sensible option for the future of rail.But the Rail Delivery Group, which brings together train operators and Network Rail, pledged to work with the Government and passengers to improve the system.RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: \u0026ldquoFranchising has brought significant benefits to passengers and the taxpayer, with services up by a quarter and running costs going from the red to the black, freeing up taxpayer\u0026rsquos money.\u0027The rail franchising model is on life support\u0027 said Andy MacDonald\u0026ldquoWe agree, though, that the current system should be reviewed and improved and the report makes a number of sensible recommendations.\u0026ldquoAs part of our plan for a changing and improving railway, we\u0026rsquove already begun sharing our initial thinking with government on how the contracting of services can evolve to deliver more.\u0026ldquoIt would be wrong for the industry to sit in a room by itself and decide what these reforms should be so we are engaging with groups representing those who rely on the railway every day.\u0026ldquoWorking together, we can deliver a better railway for the long-term for passengers, communities, the economy and people who work in rail.The Department for Transport hit back, saying the TSGN franchise was intended to facilitate improvements form the \u0026pound7 billion Thameslink Programme for North-South routes across London.A DFT spokesman said: \u0026ldquoIt is disappointing to see the committee has produced such an imbalanced report that fails to grasp the complexity of the situation, including failing to challenge inaccurate claims from the RMT.\u0026ldquoIt also fails to understand that department expressly created the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise to deliver the Thameslink Programme \u0026ndash a once-in-a-generation infrastructure upgrade to revolutionise North-South journeys through London for millions of passengers.\u0026ldquoNew Thameslink trains are already in service and are transforming performance for customers.\u0026ldquoThe delay and disruption Southern passengers experienced due to strike action in 2016 was unacceptable, but services have improved dramatically and a brand new programme will begin next month bringing further improvements to their journeys.\u0026ldquoOur franchising model already puts passengers and taxpayers first and has doubled the number of passengers using trains since privatisation reversed decades of decline and underinvestment under British Rail.
